In the beginning God formed the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was desolation and emptiness, and darkness over the face of the deep: and the spirit of God moved over the face of the waters.
And God will say there shall be light, and there shall be light.
And God will see the light that it is good, and God will separate between the light and between the darkness.
And God will call to the light day, and to the darkness he called night: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be one day.
And God will say there shall be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and there shall be a separating between waters to waters.
And God shall make a firmament, and he shall separate between the waters which are from the lower part of the firmament and between the waters which are from the upper part of the firmament: and it shall be so.
And God will call to the firmament the heavens: and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the second day.
And God will say the waters shall be gathered together from the under part of the heavens to one place, and the dry shall be seen: and it shall be so.
And God will call to the dry, earth; and to the gathering of the waters he called seas: and God will see that it is good.
And God will say the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, and the green herb bearing seed, and the fruit tree making fruit according to its kind, in which is the seed in it upon the earth: and it shall be so.
And the earth shall bring forth the tender grass, the green herb bearing seed according to its kind, and the tree making fruit in which the seed is in it, according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.
And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the third day.
And God will say there shall be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate between the day and between the night: and they shall be for signs and for set times, and for days and for years.
And they shall be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: and it shall be so.
And God will make two great lights; the great light for the rule of the day, and the small light for the rule of the night and the stars.
And God will give them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.
And to rule in the day and in the night, and to separate between the light and between the darkness: And God will see that it is good.
And the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the fourth day.
And God will say the waters shall breed abundantly creeping things, the living soul, and birds shall fly over the earth, over the face of the firmament of the heavens.
And God will form great sea monsters and every living soul creeping, which the waters bred abundantly according to their kind, and every bird of wing according to its kind: and God will see that it is good.

And God will form man in his image, in the image of God he formed him; male and female he formed them.
And God will praise them, and God will say to them, be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing creeping upon the earth.
And God will say, Lo, I gave to you every green herb scattering seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree scattering seed; to you it shall be for food.
And to every living thing of the earth, and to all the birds of the heavens and to every thing creeping upon the earth, in which is a living soul, every green herb for food: and it shall be so.
And God will see every thing which he made: and lo, very good and the evening shall be, and the morning shall be the sixth day.
And the heavens and the earth shall be completed and all their army.
And God will complete in the seventh day his work which he made, and he will rest in the seventh day from all his work which he made.
And God will praise the seventh day, and will consecrate it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God formed to make.
These the generations of the heavens and the earth in creating them, in the day of Jehovah God's making the earth and the heavens.
And every green thing of the field before it shall be in the earth, and every green herb of the field before it will spring up: for Jehovah God rained not upon the earth and not a man to work the earth.

And a river shall go out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it shall be separated into four heads.
The name of the one, Pison: it is that surrounding all the land Havilah, where there is gold.
And the gold of that land is good. There bdellium and onyx stone.
And the name of the second river, Gihon: that surrounding all the land of Cush.
And the name of the third river, Hiddekel, that going forth east of Assyria. And the fourth river, Euphrates.
And Jehovah God will take the man and will set him down in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.

But from the tree to know good and evil thou shalt not eat from it, for in the day of thy eating from it, dying, thou shalt die.
And Jehovah God will say, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make for him a help as before him.
And Jehovah God will form out of the earth every living thing of the field, and all the birds of the heavens, and he will bring in to the man to see what he will call to it; and all which the man will call it to the living soul, that its name.
And the man will call the names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field; but to the man was not found a help as before him.
And Jehovah God will cause to fall a deep sleep upon the man, and he will sleep; and he will take one of his ribs and will close up the flesh underneath it.
And Jehovah God will build the rib which he took from the man, into a woman, and will bring her to the man.
And the man will say, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; and this shall be called woman, because she was taken from man.
Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will cleave to his woman; and they shall be into one flesh.
And they two shall be naked, the man and his woman, and they shall not be ashamed.
And the serpent was crafty above every beast of the field which Jehovah God made; and he will say to the woman, Is it because God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
And the woman will say to the serpent, From the fruit of the tree of the garden we shall eat.
And from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat from it, and ye shall not touch upon it, lest ye shall die.
And the serpent will say to the woman, Dying ye shall not die.
For God is knowing in the day of your eating from it, and your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
And the woman will see that the tree is good for food, and that it is a desire to the eyes, and a tree desired to make wise; and she will take from its fruit and will eat, and will give also to her man with her, and he will eat.
And the eyes of the two shall be opened, and they shall know that they are naked; and they shall sew together the leaves of the fig tree, and shall make to themselves girdles.
And they shall hear the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden at the breeze of the day: and Adam and his wife will hide from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the wood of the garden.
And Jehovah God will call to the man, and will say to him, Where art thou?
And he will will say, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I shall be afraid, because I am naked, and I will hide myself.
And he will say, Who showed to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree which I charged thee not to eat, didst thou eat from it?
And the man will say, The woman which thou gavest with me, she gave to me from the tree, and I shall eat.
And Jehovah God will say to the woman, What is this thou didst? And the woman will say, The serpent deceived me and I shall eat.
And Jehovah God will say to the serpent, Because thou didst this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy life.
And I will put enmity between thee and between the woman, and between thy seed and between her seed; it shall lie in wait for thee as to the head, and thou shalt lie in wait for him as to the heel.
To the woman he said, Multiplying, I will multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and to thy husband thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.
And to Adam he said, Because thou didst listen to the voice of thy wife, and thou wilt eat from the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat from it; cursed the earth for thy sake; in labor shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
And thorns and weeds shall it cause to sprout forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the green herb of the field.
In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat food until thy turning back to the earth; for out of it thou wert taken; for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou turn back.
And Adam will call his wife's name Life, for she was the mother of all living.
And Jehovah God will make to Adam and to his wife, coats of skin, and will clothe them.
And Jehovah God will say, Lo, Adam became as one from us, to know good and evil: and now lest he shall send forth his hand and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity:
And Jehovah God will send him forth from the garden of Eden to work the earth which he was taken from there.
And he will drive out Adam; and he will set up from the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning itself about to keep the way of the tree of lives.
And Adam knew Life, his wife, and she will conceive and bear Cain, and said, I obtained a man of Jehovah.
And she will add to bear his brother Abel; and Abel shall be a feeder of sheep, and Cain was a laborer of the earth.
And it shall be at the end of days, and Cain shall bring in from the fruit of the earth an offering to Jehovah.
And Abel, he also brought in the first-born of his sheep, and their fat. And Jehovah will look to Abel and to his gift.
And to Cain and to his offering he looked not: and Cain will be very angry, and his countenance will fall.
And Jehovah will say to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why does thy countenance fall?
If thou shalt do well thou shalt be lifted up; and if thou shalt not do well, sin lies at the entrance; and to thee his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
And Cain will speak to Abel his brother; and it shall be in their being in the field, Cain will rise up against Abel his brother, and will kill him.
And Jehovah will say to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? and he will say, I know not: am I my brother's watcher?
And he will say, What didst thou? the voice of thy brother's bloods, crying out to me from the earth.
And now cursed art thou, from the earth, which opened her mouth to take thy brother's bloods from thy hand.
When thou shalt work the earth she shall not add to give her strength to thee. Wandering and fleeing shalt thou be in the earth.
And Cain will say to Jehovah, My sin is great, above bearing.
Lo, thou didst drive me out this day from above the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be wandering and fleeing in the earth; and it shall be, every one finding me will kill me.
And Jehovah will say to him, Therefore, every one killing Cain, he shall be avenged seven fold. And Jehovah will put a sign upon Cain, lest any finding him, smite him.
And Cain went out from the face of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.

And Zillah, she also will bear Tubal Cain, sharpening every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.
And Lamech will say his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and give ear to my word: for I killed a man to my wound, and a son to my cutting.
If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, also Lamech seventy and seven.
And Adam will know his wife again, and she will bear a son, and she will call his name Seth: for God set me a second seed instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.

But the flesh with its breath, its blood ye shall not eat.

These the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
These the families of Noah after their generations, in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
And all the earth shall be one lip, and the same words.
And it shall be in their removing from the east they shall find a valley in the land of Shmar; and they shall dwell there.
And they shall say a man to his neighbor, Come, we will make bricks, and we will burn to a burning, and brick shall be to them for stone, and potter's clay shall be to them for potter's clay.
And they will say, Come, we will build to us a city, and a tower, its head to the heavens; and we will make to us a name, lest we shall be dispersed over the face of the earth.
And Jehovah will come down to see the city, and the tower which the sons of men built.
And Jehovah will say, Behold, the people one, and one lip to them all; and this they begin to do: and now it will not be restrained from them all which they shall imagine to do.
Come, we will come down and mix their lip that they shall not hear a man the lip of his neighbor.
And Jehovah will disperse them from thence over the face of all the earth: and they will cease to build the city.
Therefore its name was called confusion, for there Jehovah confounded the lip of all the earth: and from thence Jehovah dispersed them over the face of all the earth.

And Sarah will laugh within her, saying, After it has not been to me till now, and my lord, being old.
And Jehovah will say to Abraham, For what did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall truly even I bring forth, and I have become old?
Shall the word of Jehovah be difficult, at the appointed time? I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and a son to Sarah.

And Jehovah will say, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah became great, and because their sin was exceedingly heavy,
I will go now and see whether they did wholly according to its cry coming to me; and if not, I shall know.
And the men will turn back from thence, and will go forth to Sodom: and Abraham stood yet before the face of Jehovah.
And Abraham will draw near, and will say, Wilt thou also destroy the just with the wicked.
Perhaps there is fifty just in the midst of the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty just which are within it?
Far be it with respect to thee doing as this word to kill the just with the wicked; and for the just to be as the wicked, far be it with respect to thee: shall not the judge of all the earth do judgment?
And Jehovah will say, If I shall find in Sodom fifty just, in the midst of the city, I forgive all the place for their sakes.
And Abraham will answer and say, Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, and I dust and ashes.
If the fifty just shall lack five: wilt thou destroy for sake of five all the city? And he will say, I will not destroy, if I shall find there forty and five.
And he added yet to speak to him, and he will say, If forty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do for sake of forty.
And he will say, Now will it not kindle to the Lord, and I will speak: If thirty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do, if I shall find thirty there.
And he will say, Behold now, I have begun to speak to the Lord If twenty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of twenty.
And he will say, Now will it not be angry to the Lord, and I will speak only this once: If ten shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of ten.
And Jehovah went forth after that he finished to speak to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.

And he will press upon them greatly; and they will turn aside to him, and they will come in to his house; and he will make to them a drinking, and he baked unleavened loaves, and they will eat.
Before the men of the city shall lie down, the men of Sodom surrounded the house about, from youth, even to old age, all the people from the end.
And they will call to Lot, and will say to him, Where the men which came to thee this night? bring them out to us and we shall know them.
And Lot went forth to them to the entrance, and shut the door after him,
And he will say, Now my brothers, ye shall not be evil.
Behold now, to me two daughters who have not known man'; now I will bring them forth to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men ye shall not do any thing; for, for this they came in the shadow of my city.
And they will say, Stand off. And they will say, This same came to sojourn, and shall he judge judgment: now will we do evil to thee above them: and they will press upon the man, upon Lot greatly, and they will come near to break the door.
And the men will stretch out the hand, and will bring in Lot to them to the house, and they shut the door.
And the men which were at the door of the house, they struck with blindness, from small to great: and they will be wearied to find the door.
And the men will say to Lot, Who to thee here yet? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and all which are to thee in the city, bring forth out of this place.
For we destroy this place, for their cry was great at the face of Jehovah; and Jehovah will send us to destroy it.

And when the dawn arose, the messengers will hasten upon Lot, saying, Rise up, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, being found, lest thou shalt be destroyed in the iniquity of the city.
And he shall linger, and the men will hold fast upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; in Jehovah's having compassion upon him; and they shall bring him forth, and lead him without the city.
And it shall be when having brought them forth without, he will say, Escape for thy life; thou shalt not look behind thee, and thou shalt not stay in all the circuit: escape to the mountain, lest thou shalt be <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as:</i></font> destoyed<Rf>destroyed.
And Lot will say to them, Nay, now, Lord!
Behold now, thy servant found grace in thine eyes, and thou wilt magnify thy kindness, what thou didst by me to make my soul live: and I shall not be able to escape to the mountain so evil over-taking me, and I die.
Behold now, this city drawing nigh to flee there, and it is small: now I shall be saved there, is it not small? and my soul shall live.
And he will say to him, Behold, I lifted up thy face also for thy word, not to overthrow this city for which thou spakest.
Hasten, to escape there, for I shall not be able to do the word till thy coming there: for this the name of the city was called Zoar.
The sun came forth upon the earth, and Lot came to Zoar.
And Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, sulphur and fire from Jehovah out of the heavens.

And he will look out upon the face of Sodom and Gomorrah and upon all the face of the earth of the circuit, and he will see, and behold the smoke of the earth ascended as the smoke of a furnace.
And it shall be in God's destroying the cities of the circuit, and God will remember Abraham, and he will send forth Lot out of the midst of the overthrow in overthrowing the cities in which Lot dwelt in them.
And Lot will go up from Zoar and will dwell in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he will fear to dwell in Zoar; and he will dwell in a cave, he and his two daughters.
And the first-born will say to the small, our father has become old, and not a man in the earth to come in to us according to the way of all the earth:
Come, we will give to our father wine to drink, and we will lie down with him, and we shall preserve alive seed from our father.
And they will give their father wine to drink in that night, and the first-born will go in and will lie down with her father; and he will not know in her lying down, and in her rising up.
And it shall be on the morrow, and the first-born will say to the small, Behold, I lay down yesterday with my father: we will also give him wine to drink this night; and go thou, lie down with him, and we shall preserve alive seed from our father.
And they will give their father wine to drink also in that night, and the small will arise and will he down with him, and he will not know in her lying down and her rising up.
And the two daughters of Lot will conceive by their father.
And the first-born will bring forth a son, and she will call his name Moab: this the father of Moab till this day.

And God will come to Abimelech in a dream at night, and say to him, Behold, thou dead, for the woman which thou didst take, and she having married a husband.
And Abimelech came not near to her: and he will say, Lord, wilt thou also slay a just nation?
Did he not say to me, This my sister? and she also, she said he is my brother: in the uprightness of my heart, and in cleanness of my hands have I done this.
And God will say to him in a dream, I knew also that in the uprightness of thy heart thou didst this; and I also will restrain thee from sinning against me: for this I suffered thee not to touch her.
And now turn back to the man the woman; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and do thou live: and if thou turn her not back, know that dying, thou shalt die, thou and all which are to thee.
And Abimelech will rise early in the morning, and will call to all his servants, and will speak all these words in their ears: and the men shall be greatly afraid.
And Abimelech will call to Abraham, and say to him, What didst thou to us? and what did we sin against thee, that thou didst bring upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou didst works to me which shall not be done.
And Abimelech will say to Abraham, What sawest thou that thou didst this thing?
And Abraham will say, For I said, Surely there is not the fear of God in this place; and they will kill me because of my wife.
And truly also my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother: and she was to me for wife.
And it shall be when God causes me to wander from my father's house, and I said to her, This thy kindness which thou shalt do by me; at every place to which we shall come, there say of me, He is my brother.
And Abimelech will take sheep and oxen and servants, and maid-servants, and will give to Abraham, and will return to him Sarah his wife.
And Abimelech will say, Behold, my land before thy face: dwell in the good in thine eyes.
And to Sarah he said, Behold, I gave a thousand of silver to thy brother; behold, he is to thee for a garment of the eyes to all who are with thee, and with all: and she was set right.
And Abraham will pray to God; and God will heal Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they will bring forth.
For shutting up, Jehovah shut up without every womb to the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
And Jehovah reviewed Sarah as he said; and Jehovah will do to Sarah as he spake.
And Sarah shall conceive, and bring forth to Abraham a son to his old age, at the appointed time which God spake to him.
And Abraham shall call the name of his son being born to him, whom Sarah will bear to him, Isaak.
And Abraham shall circumcise Isaak his son, the son of eight days, as God commanded him.
And Abraham the son of an hundred years in the bringing forth to him Isaak his son.
And Sarah will say, God made me laugh; all hearing will laugh with me.
And she will say, Who spake to Abraham, Sarah suckles sons? for I brought forth a son in his old age.
And the child will become great, and shall be weaned; and Abraham will make a great drinking in the day of weaning Isaak.
And Sarah will see the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she brought forth to Abraham, laughing.
And she will say to Abraham, Cast out this maid-servant and her son; for the son of this maid-servant shall not inherit with my son, with Isaak.
And the word was greatly evil in the eyes of Abraham, on account of his son.
And God will say to Abraham, It shall not be evil in thine eyes concerning the boy, and concerning thy maidservant; all which Sarah shall say to thee, hear to her voice; for in Isaak the seed shall be called to thee.
And also the son of this maid-servant, I will make him into a nation, for he is thy seed.
And Abraham will rise early in the morning, and take food, and a leathern bottle of water, and give to Hagar (putting upon her shoulder), and the child, and will send her away: and she will go forth and wander in the desert to the well of the oath.
And the waters shall be spent in the water skin, and she will cast the child under one of the shrubs.
And she will go and seat herself from over against, being far off as the bending of a bow: for she said, I will not see the death of the child. And she will seat herself from over against, and she will lift up her voice and weep.
And God will hear the voice of the child: and the messenger of God will call to Hagar from the heavens, and will say to her, What to thee Hagar? thou shalt not fear, for God heard the voice of the child, from where he is.
Arise, lift up the child, and fasten thy hand upon him; for I will make him into a great nation.
And God will open her eyes, and she will see a well of waters, and will go and fill the water skin with water, and will give the child to drink.
And God will be with the child; and he will be great, and dwell in the desert, and will be to increase the bow.
And he will dwell in the desert Paran: and his mother will take to him a wife from the land of Egypt.
And it shall be in that tune, and Abimelech will speak, and Phicol, leader of his army, to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
And now swear to me in God, whether if thou shalt lie to me and to my progeny, and to my progenies; according to the kindness which I did to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou didst sojourn in it.
And Abraham will say, I will swear.
And Abraham rebuked Abimelech on account of the well of waters which Abimelech's servants took away by force.
And Abimelech will say, I knew not who did this thing; and also thou didst not announce to me, and also I heard not except this day.
And Abraham will take sheep and oxen, and give to Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.
And Abraham set, seven ewe lambs of the sheep alone.
And Abimelech will say to Abraham, What here these seven ewe lambs which thou didst set alone?
And he will say, For the seven ewe lambs thou shalt take from my hand, in order to be to me for a testimony that I dug this well.
For this he called that place, The well of the oath, for there they two aware.
And they will make a covenant, at the well of the oath, and Abimelech will rise up, and Phicol, the leader of his army, and they will turn back to the land of the Philistines,
And be will plant the tamarisk by the well of the oath, and will call there upon the name of Jehovah, the eternal God.
And Abraham will sojourn in the land of the Philistines many days.
And it shall be after these words, and God tried Abraham, and he will say to him, Abraham: and he will say, Behold, here I.
And he will say, Take now thy son, thine only, whom thou didst love, Isaak, and go by thyself to the land of Moriah; and carry him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains of which I told thee.
And Abraham will rise early in the morning, and will saddle his ass, and will take two of his boys with him, and Isaak his son, and he will cleave the wood for the burnt offering, and will rise up and go to the place God spake to him.
In the third day, Abraham will lift up his eyes and will see the place from far.
And Abraham will say to his boys, Sit ye here in this place with the ass; I and the boy will go even there and worship, and will turn back to you.
And Abraham will take the wood of the burnt offering, and put upon Isaak his son; and will take in his hand the fire and the knife, and they will go, they two together.
And Isaak will say to Abraham his father, and he will say, My father: and he will say, Behold, me, my son: And he will say, Behold the fire and the wood, and where the sheep for a burnt offering?
And Abraham will say, God will see to himself the sheep for a burnt-offering my son: and they will go, they two together.
And they will come to the place which God said to him; and Abraham will build an altar there, and put in order the wood: and he will find Isaak his son, and put him upon the altar, upon the wood.
And Abraham will stretch out the hand and will take the knife to slaughter his son.
And the messenger of Jehovah will call to him out of the heavens, and will say, Abraham, Abraham. And he will say, Behold me.
And he will say, Thou shalt not put forth thy hand upon the boy, and thou shalt do nothing to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and thou didst not spare thy son thine only, from me.
And Abraham will lift up his eyes, and will see and behold a ram behind, being held in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham will come and take the ram and bring it for a burnt offering instead of his son.
And Abraham will call the name of that place, Jehovah will see: which shall be said to this day, Jehovah will see in the mountain.
And the messenger of Jehovah will call to Abraham the second time out of the heavens.
And he will say, By myself did I swear, says Jehovah, for because that thou didst this word, and didst not spare thy son, thine only.
That praising, I will praise thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand upon the lip of the sea; and thy seed shall inherit the gate of his enemies.
And in thy seed all the nations of the earth shall be praised; because that thou didst listen to my voice.
And Abraham will turn back to his boys, and they will rise up, and go together to the well of the oath; and Abraham will dwell at the well of the oath.
And it shall be after these words, it will be announced to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also will bring forth sons to Nahor, thy brother.
Uz, his first-born, and Buz, his brother, and Lemuel, the father of Aram.
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
And Bethuel will beget Rebekah: these eight, Milcah will bring forth to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
And his concubine, and her name Reumah, and she will bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachab.
And the life of Sarah shall be a hundred years, and twenty years, and seven years; the years of the life of Sarah.
And Sarah shall die in the city of four; this is Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham will come to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
And Abraham will rise up from the face of his dead, and speak to the sons of Heth, saying,
I am a sojourner and stranger with you: give me the possession of a grave with you, and I will bury my dead from my face.
And the sons of Heth will answer Abraham, saying to him,
Hear us, lord; thou a prince of God in the midst of us: in the choice of our graves, bury thy dead; a man of us shall not withhold from thee his grave from burying thy dead.
And Abraham will rise up and will bow himself to the earth before the sons of Heth.
And he will speak to them, saying, If it is your soul to bury my dead from my face, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron, son of Zohar.
And he shall give to me the cave of Machpelah, which is to him, which is in the end of his field; for the full silver he shall give it to me in the midst of you for the possession of a grave.
And Ephron dwelt in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite will answer Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, of all going to the gate of his city, saying,
Nay, lord, hear me; the field I gave thee, and the cave which is in it, to thee I gave it before the eyes of the sons of my people; I gave to thee: bury thy dead.
And Abraham will bow himself down before the face of the people of the land.
And he will speak to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, Surely, if thou art for it, hear me: I gave silver for the field, take of me: and I will bury my dead there.
And Ephron will answer Abraham, saying to him,
Lord, hear me: the land, four hundred shekels of silver; between me and between thee, what is that? and bury thy dead.
And Abraham will listen to Ephron, and Abraham will weigh to Ephron the silver, which he spake in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, passing for traffic.
And Ephron's field will stand, which is in Machpelah, which is before the face of Mamra, the field and cave which are in it, and every tree which is in the field, which is in all the bounds round about.
To Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, with all going to the gate of his city.
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before the face of Mamra: this is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
And the field will stand, and the cave which is in it, to Abraham for the possession of a burying place, from the sons of Heth.
And Abraham was old and come days: and Jehovah praised Abraham in every thing.
And Abraham will say to the old man of his house ruling over all which is to him, Put now thy hand under my thigh.
And I will cause thee to swear by Jehovah, God of the heavens, and God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife to my son, from the daughters of the Canaanites in the midst of whom I shall dwell.
For thou shalt go to my land and to my native country, and take a wife to my son, to Isaak.
And the servant will say to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to come after me to this land: shall I turning back, turn back your son to the land from whence thou camest?
And Abraham will say to him, Observe to thyself that thou shalt not turn back ray son there.
Jehovah, God of the heavens, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my birth, and who spake to me, and who sware to me, saying, To thy seed will I give this land: he will send his messenger before thy face, and thou shalt take a wife to my son from thence.

Behold, I stand at the fountain of waters, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water.
And it shall be the girl to whom saying to her, incline now thy bucket, and I will drink; and she said, Drink, and I will also give thy camels to drink; thou didst appoint for thy servant Isaak; and by it I shall know that thou didst kindness with my lord.
And it shall be before he finished speaking, and behold Rebekah came forth, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, and her bucket upon her shoulder.
And the girl good of aspect exceedingly; a virgin, and man knew her not: and she will go down to the fountain and fill her bucket, and come up.
And the servant will run to meet her, and he will say, Give me to drink now a little water from thy bucket.

And the man will come into the house and will loosen the camels, and give straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men which are with him.

And I will come this day to the fountain, and say, Jehovah, God of lord Abraham, if thou wilt now incline thyself to prosper my way in which I go:

And I will increase thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to thy seed all these lands: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be praised.
Because that Abraham listened to my voice, and he will watch my watches, my commands, my statutes, and my precepts.

And they will dig another well, and will strive for that also: and he will call its name Sitnah.
And he will remove from thence, and will dig another well; and they strove not for that: and he will call its name Rehoboth; and he will say, For now Jehovah made wide for us, and made us fruitful in the earth.

And he will say, Behold now, I grew old; I knew not the day of my death.
Therefore take now, thy weapon, thy quiver and thy bow, and go forth to the field and hunt for me a hunting.
And make for me dainties as that I loved, and bring it to me, and eating, that my soul shall praise thee before I shall die.

And Rebekah spake to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speaking to Esau thy brother, saying,
Bring to me a hunting, and make for me dainties, and eating, and I will praise thee before Jehovah, before my death.
And now my son, hear to my voice, according to that I command thee.

And thou shall bring to thy father, and eating, so that he will praise thee before his death.
And Jacob will say to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother a man of hair, and I a smooth man:

Give my wives and my children, for whom I served thee, and I will go forth; for thou knewest ray work which I served thee.
And Laban will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, I prognosticated, and Jehovah will praise me because of thee.
And he will say, Specify thy hire to me, and I will give.
And he will say to him, Thou knewest what I served thee, and what was thy cattle with me.
For little which was to thee before me, and it will break forth into a multitude; and Jehovah will praise thee at my foot: and now when shall I make to myself a house?
And he will say, What shall I give to thee? and Jacob will say, Thou shalt not give to me anything. If thou wilt do to me this word, I will return; I will feed thy sheep; I will watch.
I will pass over among all thy sheep this day, removing from thence every sheep speckled and patched, and every sheep black among the lambs; and the patched and speckled among the she-goats; and it shall be my hire.
And my justice shall speak for me in the day tomorrow, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one which is not speckled and patched among the she-goats and black among the lambs, that to be stolen with me.
And Laban will say to him, Behold, it shall be according to thy word.
And he will remove in that day the he-goats banded and patched, and all the she-goats speckled and patched; every one which being white on it, and every one black among the sheep, and he will give into the hand of his sons.
And he will set a way of three days between him and between Jacob; and Jacob fed Laban's sheep the rest.
And Jacob will take to himself a rod of green storax, and the almond tree, and the plane tree, and he will strip off of them the white strippings, uncovering the white which was upon the rods.
And he set the rods which he stripped, in the flowings of channels of water, when the flock shall come to drink, before the sheep, and they shall be in heat in coming to drink.
And the sheep shall conceive at the rods, and shall bring forth sheep banded and speckled and patched.
And Jacob separated the lambs, and he will give the faces of the sheep to the banded and every one black among the sheep of Laban: and he will set to himself the flocks, to himself alone, and not put them with Laban's sheep.
And it was in every one conceiving of the strong sheep, and Jacob put the rods before the eyes of the sheep in the floorings, to conceive among the rods.
And in the sheep being feeble, he will not put in: and those being feeble, were to Laban, and those being strong, to Jacob.
And the man will break forth greatly, greatly; and there will be to him many sheep and maids, and servants, and camels and asses.
And he will hear the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob took all which was to our father, and from what was to our father he made all this multitude.
And Jacob will see the face of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as yesterday, the third day.
And Jehovah will say to Jacob, Turn back to the land of thy fathers, and to thy lineage; and I will be with thee.
And Jacob will send and call to Rachel and to Leah in the field to his sheep.
And will say to them, I saw the face of your father that it is not towards me as yesterday the third day: and the God of my father was with me.
And ye yourselves knew that with all my strength I served, your father,
And your father deceived me and changed my wages ten parts; and God gave him not to do evil by me.
If thus he will say, The speckled shall be thy hire; and all the sheep shall bring forth speckled: and if thus he will say, The banded shall be thy hire, and all the sheep will bring forth white-footed.
And God will take away the cattle of your father and will give them to me.
And it shall be in the time the sheep shall conceive, and I shall lift up mine eyes, and I shall see in a dream, and behold, the he-goats ascending upon the sheep, banded, speckled and sprinkled with spots.
And the messenger of God will say to me in a dream, Jacob: and I shall say, Behold me.
And he will say, Lift up now thine eyes and see all the he-goats ascending upon the sheep, banded, speckled and sprinkled with spots; for I saw all that Laban did to thee.
I the God of the house of God, where thou didst anoint there a pillar; where thou didst vow to me there a vow: now arise, go forth from this land, and turn back to the land of thy kindred.
And Rachel will answer, and Leah, and they will say to him, Is yet to us a portion and inheritance in our father's house?
Were we not reckoned strangers by him? for he sold us, and also eating, he ate up our silver.
For all the riches which God took away from our father, that is to us and to our sons: and now all which God said to thee, do.
And Jacob will rise, and lift up his sons and his wives upon the camels.
And he will lead away all his cattle and all his horse which he acquired, the cattle of his acquisition, which he acquired in Padan Aram, to go to Isaak his father in the land of Canaan.
And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel will steal the family gods which were to her father.
And Jacob will steal the heart of Laban the Syrian, for not announcing to him that he broke away.
And he will break away, and all which was to him; and he will rise and pass over the river, and will set his face to Mount Gilead.
And it will be announced to Laban in the third day, that Jacob broke away.
And he will take his brethren with him, and pursue after him a way of seven days: and he will overtake him in Mount Gilead.
And God will come to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night and will say to him, Watch to thyself, lest thou shalt speak with Jacob from good to evil.
And Laban will overtake Jacob. And Jacob pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban pitched with his brethren in Mount Gilead.
And Laban will say to Jacob, What didst thou and thou didst steal my heart, and will carry away my daughters as captives of the sword?
For what didst thou hide to break away, and didst steal me, and didst not announce to me? and I will send thee away with gladness and with songs, with the drum and with the harp?
And didst not permit me to kiss my sons and to my daughters? now thou wert foolish doing it.
It is for the power of my hand mighty to do with you evil: and the God of your father yesterday spake to me, saying, Watch to thyself from speaking with Jacob from good to evil.
And now going thou didst go, for desiring thou didst greatly desire after the house of thy father; for what didst thou steal my gods?
And Jacob will answer and say to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest thou wilt tear away my daughters from me;
With whom thou shalt find thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren, behold for thyself what is with me and take to thee: and Jacob knew not that Rachel stole them.
And Laban will go into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maids, and he found them not And he will go out from the tent of Leah and will go into Rachel's tent.
And Rachel took the family gods, and she will put them in the camel's saddle and will sit upon them. And Laban will feel all the tent, and he found not.
And she will say to her father, My lord will not be angry in his eyes, that I shall not be able to rise from thy face, for the way of women is to me. And he will search and he found not the family gods,
And it kindled to Jacob, and he will contend with Laban, and Jacob will answer and say to Laban, What my fault? what my sin that thou didst hotly pursue after me?
That thou didst feel all my vessels, what didst thou find of all the vessels of thy house? Set here before my brethren and thy brethren, and they shall decide between us two.
These twenty years I am with thee; thy sheep and thy she-goats were not barren, and the rams of thy flock, I ate not.
The torn I brought not to thee; I shall bear the blame of it; from my hand thou will seek it, thefts of the day, and thefts of the night.
I was in the day, the drought consumed me, and cold in the night, and sleep will flee away from mine eyes.
Here to me twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy sheep; and thou wilt change my hire ten portions.
If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaak was not with me, then now, empty thou hadst sent me away. My affliction and the labor of my hand God saw and he rebuked yesterday.
And Laban will answer and say to Jacob, The daughters, my daughters, and the sons, my sons, and the sheep, my sheep, and all which thou sawest, this to me, and to my daughters: what shall I do to these this day, or to their sons which they brought forth?
Now come thou we will make a covenant, I and thou; and it was for witness between me and between thee.
And Jacob will take a stone and raise up a pillar.
And Jacob will say to his brethren, Gather stones; and they will take stones and make a heap; and they will eat there upon the heap.
And Laban will call it the heap of testimony, and Jacob called it the heap of witness.
And Laban will say, This heap a witness between me and between thee this day, for this its name was called Gilead:
And watchtower: for he said Jehovah will watch between me and between thee when we shall be concealed a man from his Mend.
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives to my daughters, no man is with us, seeing God a witness between me and between thee.
And Laban will say to Jacob, Behold this heap; and behold the pillar which I cast between me and between thee.
A witness this heap, and a witness the pillar, if I will not pass over this heap to thee, and thou shalt not pass over to me, this heap and this pillar for evil.
The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor shall judge between us, the God of their father: and Jacob will swear by the fear of his father Isaak.
And Jacob will sacrifice a sacrifice upon the mount, and will call to his brethren to eat bread, and they will eat bread, and they will pass the night in the mount.
And Laban will rise up in the morning and will kiss his sons and his daughters, and will bless them: and Laban will go and turn back to his place.
And Jacob went on his way and the messengers of God met with him.
And Jacob will say when seeing them, This the camp of God: and he will call the name of that place the camps.
And Jacob will send messengers before his face to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Adam.
And he will command them, saying, Thus shall ye say to my lord to Esau, Thus thy servant Jacob said, With Laban I sojourned and lingered till now.
And there will be to me ox and ass, sheep and servant, and maid; and I shall send to announce to my lord to find grace in thine eyes.
And the messengers will turn back to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau, and also he came to thy meeting, and four hundred men with him.
And Jacob will be greatly afraid and it will press upon him: and he will divide the people which were with him, and the sheep and the oxen, and the camels, into two camps.
And he will say, If Esau shall come to the one camp and smite it, and the remaining camp was to escape.
And Jacob will say, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaak, Jehovah having said to me, Turn back to thy land and to thy family, and I will do well with thee.
I was little from all the kindness and from all the truth which thou didst to thy servant; for with my rod I passed over this Jordan, and now I became into two camps.
Take me away now from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest he shall come and smite me, the mother upon the sons.
And thou saidst, Doing well I will do well with thee, and I set thy seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be counted for multitude.
And he will pass the night them in that night, and he will take from what came into his hand, a gift to Esau his brother.
Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep and twenty rams.
Camels giving suck, and their young, thirty; forty heifers and ten bulls; twenty she-asses and ten foals.
And he will give into the hand of his servants a flock, a flock itself alone; and he will say to his servants, Pass over before me, and ye shall put enlargement between flock and between flock.
And he will command the first, saying, When Esau my brother shall meet thee and ask thee saying, To whom thou? and whither wilt thou go? and to whom these before thee?
And thou saying, To thy servant, to Jacob: this a gift sent to my lord to Esau, and behold also he is behind us.
And he will command also the second, also the third, also all going behind the flocks, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau in your finding him.
And ye said, Also behold thy servant Jacob behind us. For he said, I will appease his face with the gift going before me, and after this I will see his face; perhaps he will receive my face.
And the gift will pass over before his face, and he remained in that night in the camp.
And he will rise in that night and take his two wives and his two maids, and his eleven sons, and he will pass over the passage of Jabbok.
And he will take them and will cause them to pass through the torrent, and he will cause to pass through what is to him.
And Jacob will be left alone by himself, and a man will wrestle with him till the ascending of the morning.
And he will see that he will not prevail over him and he will touch upon the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh will be alienated in his wrestling with him.
And he will say, Send me away, for the morning ascended: and he will say, I will not send thee away, unless thou didst bless me.
And he will say to him, What thy name? and he will say, Jacob.
And he will say, Thy name shall no more be said Jacob, but Israel, for thou wert a prince with God and with men, and thou shalt prevail.
And Jacob will ask and will say, Announce now, thy name: and he will say, For what this thou wilt ask for my name? and he will bless him there.
And Jacob will call the name of the place, the face of God: for I saw God lace to face, and my soul shall be saved.
And the sun will rise to him when he passed through the face of God, and he limped upon his thigh.
For this, the sons of Israel will not eat the sinew which dried up which is upon the hollow of the thigh, even till this day; for he touched upon the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew which dried up.
And Jacob will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he will divide the children to Leah and to Rachel and to the two maids.
And he set the maids and their children first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph behind them.
And he passed through before them, and he will bow himself upon the earth seven times till he brought himself near to his brother.
And Esau will run to his meeting and he will embrace him and will fall upon his neck and will kiss him, and they will weep.
And he will lift up his eyes and will see the women and the children, and he will say, To whom these to thee? And he will say, The children with whom God compassionated thy servant.
And the maids will draw near, they and their children, and they will bow themselves.
And Leah also will draw near, and her children, and they will bow themselves; and after, Joseph will draw near and Rachel, and they will prostrate themselves.
And he will say, What to thee all this camp which I met? and he will say, To find grace in thine eyes, my lord.
And Esau will say, There is much to me, my brother; what is to thee shall be to thee.
And Jacob will say, Nay, now, if now I found grace in thine eyes, and take my gift from my hand, for, for this, I saw thy face as seeing the face of God, and thou wilt be satisfied with me.
Take now my blessing which was brought to thee, for God compassionated me, and because all things are to me; and he will press upon him, and he will take.
And he will say, We will remove and go, and I will go before thee.

Nothing is great in this house above me: and he kept not back anything from me except thee, because thou his wife: and how shall I do this great evil and sin before God?
And it will be in her speaking to Joseph day by day, and he listened not to her to he by her, to be with her.

And in the vine three shoots; and this as flourishing, its leaf went forth; the clusters of grapes were ripened.
And Pharaoh's cup in my hand; and I shall take the grapes and press them into Pharaoh's cup, and I shall give the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

Yet in three days Pharaoh will lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place, and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, according to thy first judgment, when thou wert his cup-bearer.
But remember me with thyself, when it shall be well to thee, and now do kindness to me, and remember me to Pharaoh and bring me out of this house.

And there with us a Hebrew youth, servant to the chief of the cooks: and we shall relate to him, and he will interpret to us our dreams; and he interpreted a man according to his dream.

And Joseph will answer Pharaoh, saying, Not in me: God will answer Pharaoh with peace.
And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, In my dream I stood by the lip of the river.
And behold, from the river came up seven heifers, fat of flesh and fair of form, and they will feed in marsh grass.
And behold, seven other heifers coming up after them, poor and evil exceedingly, in form, and thin in flesh I saw not like them in all the land of Egypt for evil.
And the heifers thin and evil will devour the first seven fat heifers.
And they shall come into their belly, and they shall not know that they came into their belly; and evil of form as that in the beginning. And I shall awake.
And I shall see in my dream, and behold, seven ears coming up in one stalk, full and good.
And behold, seven ears dry, thin, blasted by the east, springing up after them.
And the thin ears will swallow the seven good ears: and I spake to the sacred scribes, and there was none announcing to me.
And Joseph will say to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh, one: this which he did; God announces to Pharaoh.
The seven good heifers, they are seven years; and the seven good ears, they are seven years: this dream one.
And the seven heifers, thin and evil, coming up after them, they are seven years; and the seven ears, thin, blasted by the east, shall be seven years of famine.
This the word which I spake to Pharaoh: what God did, he showed Pharaoh.
Behold, seven years coming of great plenty, in all the land of Egypt.
And seven years of famine arose after them, and all the plenty was forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine consumed the land.
And the plenty shall not be known in the land on account of the famine after this; for it shall be exceedingly heavy.
And because of the repeating of Pharaoh's dream twice, that the word was prepared from God; and God is hastening to do it.
And now will Pharaoh look out a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
And will Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, exacting a fifth part of the land of Egypt, in the seven years of plenty.
And they shall gather all the food of these good years coming, and they shall heap up the grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and they shall watch food in the cities.
And the food was for a deposit to the land, for the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be cut off in the famine.
And the word will be good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
And Pharaoh will say to his servants, Shall we find such as this man which has the spirit of God in him?
And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, After that God showed thee all this, none discerning and wise as thou.
Thou shalt be over my house, and to thy mouth all my people shall bend: only upon the throne I shall be great above thee.
And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, See, I gave thee over all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh will remove his signet ring from his hand, and will give it upon Joseph's hand; and will put upon him a white garment, and will put a gold collar about his neck.
And he will cause him to ride in the second chariot which is to him. And they will cry out before him, Aback. And he gave him over all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee, a man shall not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh will call Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he will give to him Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, for a wife; and Joseph will go forth over the land of Egypt.
And Joseph the son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and Joseph will go forth from the face of Pharaoh, and will pass over all the land of Egypt.
And the earth will make in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.
And he will gather all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and he will give the food in the cities: the food of the field of the city which round about her, he gave in the midst of her.
And Joseph will gather grain as the sand of the sea, exceedingly much that he ceased to number; for there was no numbering.
And to Joseph will be born two sons before the years of the famine will come: which Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, bare to him.
And Joseph will call the name of the first-born, Manasseh; for God made me forget all my toils and all my father's house.
And the name of the second, he called Ephraim; for God caused me to flourish in the land of my affliction.
And the seven years of plenty will be completed, which was in the land of Egypt.
And the seven years of famine will begin to come, according to that Joseph said: and the famine will be in all the lands; and in all the land of Egypt was bread.
And all the land of Egypt shall hunger, and the people will cry out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh will say to all Egypt, Go to Joseph; what he shall say to you, ye shall do.
And the famine was upon all the face of the earth: and Joseph will open all which in them, and he will sell to Egypt; and the famine was strong in the land of Egypt.
And all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy, for the famine was strong in all the earth.
And when Jacob shall see there is selling in Egypt, Jacob will say to his sons, For what will ye look?
Behold I heard that there is selling in Egypt: go ye there, and buy grain for us from thence; and we shall live and shall not die.
And Joseph's brethren, the ten, will go to buy grain from Egypt.
And Benjamin, Josephs brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest harm should meet him.
And the sons of Israel will come to buy in the midst of those coming; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
And Joseph, he the ruler over the land, and he selling grain to all the people of the earth; and Joseph's brethren will come, and will worship before him the face to the earth.
And Joseph will see his brethren, and will know them, and he will not let himself be known to them. And will speak with them hard things: and he will say to them, From whence came ye? And they will say, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
And Joseph will know his brethren, and they knew him not.
And Joseph will remember the dreams which he dreamed concerning them, and he will say to them, Ye spying; to see the naked places of the land ye came.
And they will say to him, Nay my lord, and thy servants came to buy food.
We all one man's sons; we true; we thy servants were not spying.
And he will say to them, Nay, to see the naked places of the land ye came.
And they will say, Thy servants twelve brethren; we the sons of one man in the land of Canaan: and behold, the little one with our father this day, and one, not.
And Joseph will say to them, This which I spake to you, saying, Ye spying:
In this ye shall be proved; Pharaoh living, if ye shall go forth from here except in the coming of your brother, the little one hither.
Send one of you and he shall take your brother, and ye to be bound, and your words shall be proved, whether the truth with you; and if not, Pharaoh living, for ye are spying.
And he will gather them to guard three days.
And Joseph will say to them in the third day, This do ye, and live, I fearing God.
If ye true, one of your brethren shall be bound in the house of your guard, and ye yourselves go carry the selling for the famine of your houses.
And ye shall bring your little brother to me, and your words shall be believed, and ye shall not die. And they will do so.
And they will say, a man to his brother, Truly we guilty concerning our brother, when we saw the straits of his soul in his entreating us, and we heard him not; for this, these straits are come to us.
And Reuben will answer them, saying, Spake I not to you, saying, Ye shall not sin against the child; and ye heard not? and also behold his blood was required.
And they will not know that Joseph heard them, for an interpreter between them.
And he will turn about from them, and will weep; and he will turn back to them and speak to them, and he will take from them Simeon, and will bind him before their eyes.
And Joseph will command, and they will fill their vessels with grain, and turn back their silver to a man, into his sack, and give to them provision for the way: and he will do thus to them.
And they will lift up the grain upon their asses, and they will go from thence.
And the one will open his sack to give food to his ass in the lodging place, and he will see his silver; for behold, it in the mouth of his sack.
And he will say to his brethren, My silver restored; and also behold in my sack: and their heart will go forth and they will tremble, a man saying to his brother, What this God did to us?
And they will come to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and they will announce to him all having happened to them, saying,
The man, the lord of the land, spake to us hard things, and he will give us for spying the land.
And we shall say to him, We are true; we were not spying;
We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the little one, he with our father in the land of Canaan.
And the man, the lord of the land, will say to us, In this I shall know that ye are true; leave one of your brethren with me, and take for the famine of your houses and go.
And bring your little brother to me, and I shall know that ye are not spying, but ye are true: I will give to you your brother and ye shall traffic in the land.
And it will be in their emptying their sacks, and behold, the bundle of silver of each in his sack: and they will see the bundles of their silver, they and their father, and they will be afraid.
And Jacob their father will say to them, Me ye bereaved of children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin: all these things were against me.
And Reuben will speak to his father, saying, Kill my two sons, if I shall not bring him to thee: give him into my hand, and I will turn him back to thee.
And he will say, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother died, and he alone was left: and harm meeting him in the way in which ye shall go, and ye bring down my old age with grief to hades.
And the famine was heavy upon the earth.
And it shall be when they finished eating the grain which they brought from Egypt, their father will say to them, Turn back, buy for us a little food.
And Judah will speak to him, saying, Protesting, the man protested to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother is with you.
If thou art sending our brother with us we will go down and will buy food for thee.
And if thou art not sending, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face except your brother is with you.
And Israel will say, For what did ye evil to me to announce to the man to be yet a brother to you?
And they will say, Asking, the man asked about us and about our family, saying, Is your father yet living? is there a brother to you? and we announced to him according to the mouth of these words: Knowing, did we know that he will say, Bring down your brother?
And Judah will say to Israel his father, Send the youth with me, and we will arise and go; and we shall live and not die, also we, also thou, also our little ones.
I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou seek him, if I brought him not to thee and set him before thee, I sinned before thee all the days.
For unless we lingered we had turned back this twice.
And Israel their father will say to them, If so now, do this; take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down to the man a gift of a little balsam, and a little honey and spice and resin, pistacia nuts, and almonds.
And take of twice the silver in your hands; and the silver turned back in the mouth of your sacks, ye shall turn back in your hand; perhaps it was an error.
And take your brother and arise, turn back to the man.
And God Almighty will give to you mercy before the man, and send you your one brother and Benjamin: and when I was bereaved of children, I was bereaved of children.
And the men will take this gift, and they took double the silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and they will rise up and go down to Egypt, and they will stand before Joseph.
And Joseph will see Benjamin with them, and he will say to him over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaughter a slaughter, and make ready, for the men shall eat with me at noon.
And the man will do according to what Joseph said: and the man will bring the men into Joseph's house.
And the men will be afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they will say, For the word of the silver turned back in our sacks at the beginning, we were brought in; to roll himself upon us and to fall upon us and to take us for servants and our asses.
And they will come near the man which was over Joseph's house, and they will say to him at the entrance of the house,
And they will say, With leave my lord, coming down, we came down at the beginning to buy food.
And it will be as we came to the lodging place, and we opened our sacks, and behold, the silver of each in the mouth of his sack, our silver in weight: and we turned it back in our hand.
And other silver we brought down in our hand to buy food: we knew not who put our silver in our sacks.
And he will say, Peace to you, ye shall not be afraid; your God, and the God of your father, gave to you treasure in your sacks: your silver came to me. And he brought forth to them. Simeon.
And the man will bring the men into Joseph's house, and will give water, and they will wash their feet; and he will give fodder to their asses.
And they will make ready the gift at the coming of Joseph at noon: for they heard that they shall eat bread there.
And Joseph will come to his house and they will bring to him the gift which is in their hand to the house, and they will worship towards him to the earth.
And he will ask them concerning peace, and he will say, Is it peace to your father, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet living?
And they will say, Peace to thy servant to our father, he is yet living: and they will bow down and worship.
And he will lift up his eyes and see his brother Benjamin, the son of his mother, and he will say, This your little brother of whom ye spake to me? and he will say, God will compassionate thee my son.
And Joseph will hasten; for his bowels will move to his brother: and he will seek to weep, and he will go to his store-chamber and will weep there.
And he will wash his face and come forth, and will restrain himself, and will say, Place bread.
And they will set for him alone, and for them alone, and the Egyptians eating with him, alone; for the Egyptians will not be able to eat bread with the Hebrews; for it is abomination to the Egyptians.
And they will set before him, the first-born, according to his seniority, and the small according to his minority: and the men will wonder each at his friend.
And he will take gifts from before him to them: and Benjamin's gift will increase above all their gifts, five parts. And they will drink and be intoxicated with him.
And he will command him over house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they shall be able to lift up, and put the silver of each in the mouth of his sack.
And my cup, the silver cup, thou shalt put in the sack's mouth of the small one, and the silver of his grain; and he will do according to the word which Joseph spake.
The morning shone, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.
They came forth out of the city, they were not far off, and Joseph said to him over his house, Arise, pursue after the men, and having overtaken them, and say to them, For what did ye requite evil for good?
Is it not this which my lord will drink in it, and divining he will divine in it? ye were evil in which ye did.
And he will overtake them, and will speak to them these words.
And they will say to him, For what will my lord speak according to these words? far be it for thy servants to do according to this word.
Behold, the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we turned back to thee from the land of Canaan: and how shall we steal from thy lord's house, silver or gold?
With whomsoever of thy servants it shall be found, and he shall die, and also we will be for servants to my lord.
And he will say, Also now according to your words let it be thus: with whomsoever it shall be found, he shall be servant to me, and ye shall be pure.
And they will hasten, and will take down each his sack to the earth, and they will open each his sack.
And he will search, beginning at the great and finishing at the small: and he will find the cup in Benjamin's sack.
And they will rend their garments, and will lift up each upon his ass, and will turn back to the city.
And Judah and his brethren will come to Joseph's house, and he yet there: and they will fall before him to the earth.
And Joseph will say to them, What this deed ye did? knew ye not that divining, a man shall divine such as I?
And Judah will say to him, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? and how shall we be justified? God found the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants to my lord, also we, also him the cup being found in his hand.
And he will say, Far be it for me to do this: the man in whose band the cup being found, he shall be servant to me; and ye, go ye up in peace to your father.
And Judah will come near to him and will say, With leave my lord, now shall thy servant speak a word in the ear of my lord, and thine anger shall not be kindled against thy servant; for with thee as Pharaoh.
My lord didst ask thy servants, saying, Is there a father to you, or a brother?
And we said to my lord, There is a father to us, an old man, and a child of old age, a little one: and his brother died, and he will be left alone to his mother; and his father loved him.
And thou wilt say to thy servants, Bring him down to me, and I shall set mine eyes upon him.
And we shall say to my lord, The youth will not be able to leave his father; and did he leave his father, he died.
And thou wilt say to thy servants, If your little brother shall not come down with you, ye shall not add to see my face.
And it shall be when we went up to thy servant our father, and announced to him the words of, my lord.
And our father will say, Turn back and buy for us a little food.
And we shall say, We shall not be able to go down: if our little brother is with us, and we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man's face, and our little brother not with us.
And thy servant my father will say to us, Ye knew that my wife brought forth to me two.
And the one went forth from me and it was said, Surely he was torn in pieces, he was torn in pieces; and I saw him not till now.
And took ye this also from my face, and harm befell him, and ye brought down my old age with evil to hades.
And now if I came to thy servant my father, and the youth not with us, for his soul is bound upon his soul,
And it was when he having seen that the youth is not, and he will die: and thy servants brought down the old age of thy servant our father in grief to hades.
For thy servant became surety for the youth with my father, saying, If I shall not bring him to thee, I sinned against my father all the days.
At this time thy servant shall now remain for the youth, a servant to my lord; and the youth shall go up with his brethren.
For how shall I go up to my father and the youth not with me? lest I shall look upon the evil which shall find my father.
And Joseph will not be able to restrain himself before all standing by him; and he will cry out, Take out every man from me: and a man stood not with him, in Joseph's making himself known to his brethren.
And he will give forth his voice in weeping, and the Egyptians will hear and the house of Pharaoh will hear.
And Joseph will say to his brethren, I am Joseph; is my father yet living? and his brethren will not be able to answer him; for they trembled from before him.
And Joseph will say to his brethren, Come near now to me: and they will come near, and he will say, I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold me into Egypt.
And now, ye shall not be grieved, and it shall not burn in your eyes, because ye sold me here: for God sent me before you for the preservation of life.
For this the second year of the famine in the midst of the land: and yet five years in which no ploughing and reaping.
And God will send me before you to put for you a remnant upon the earth, and to preserve life for you by a great deliverance.
And now not you sent me here, but God: and he placed me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
Hasten and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus said thy son Joseph, God placed me for lord to all Egypt; come down to me, thou wilt not remain.
And thou didst dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou wert near to me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy sheep and thine oxen and all which is to thee.
And I nourished thee there (for yet five years of famine), lest thou shalt be poor, thou and thy house, and all which is to thee.
And behold, your eyes seeing, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that my mouth is speaking to you.
And ye announced to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all which ye have seen: and haste ye, and bring ye down my father here.
And he will fall upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and will weep; and and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
And he will kiss all his brethren, and will weep upon them: and after this his brethren sake with him.
And the voice was heard in the house of Pharaoh, saying, Joseph's brethren came; and it will be good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye: your cattle and come, go to the land of Canaan.
And take your father and your houses, and come to me: and I will give to you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the heart of the land.
And thou being commanded, this do ye; take to you from the land of Egypt, wagons for your little ones, and for your wives, and take your father and come.
And your eye shall not spare upon your vessels: for the good of all the land of Egypt is to you.
And the sons of Israel will do so: and Joseph will give to them wagons, by the mouth of Pharaoh, and he will give to them provision for the way.
To all of them he gave, to each, changes of garments: and to Benjamin he gave three hundred of silver and five changes of garments.
And to his father he sent according to this: ten asses lifting up from the good of Egypt, and ten she-asses lifting up grain and bread: and food for his father for the way.
And he will send his brethren away, and they will go; and he will say to them, Ye shall not be angry in the way.
And they will go up from Egypt, and will come to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
And they will announce to him, saying, Joseph is yet living, and that he the ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart will be cold for he believed them not.
And they will say to him all the words of Joseph which he spake to them: and he will see the wagons which Joseph sent to take him, and the spirit of Jacob their father will live.
And Israel will say, It is much: Joseph my son is yet living: I will go and see him before I shall die.
And Israel will remove and all which is to him, and he will come to the well of the oath, and he will sacrifice sacrifices to the God of his father Isaak.
And God will speak to Israel in a vision of the night, and he will say, Jacob! Jacob! and he will say, Behold me.
And he will say, I am God, the God of thy father: thou shalt not fear going down to Egypt; for I will there make thee into a great nation.
I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will raise thee up; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
And Jacob will rise up from the well of the oath: and the sons of Israel will take up Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh sent to take him.
And they will take their cattle and their goods which they acquired in the land of Canaan, and they will come to Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him;
His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed, he brought with him to Egypt.
And these the names of the sons of Israel having come to Egypt. Jacob and his sons: the first born of Jacob, Reuben.
And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch and Phallu and Hezron and Carmi.
And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin, and Zohar and Saul, son of the Canaanitess.

And the sons of Joseph which were born to him in Egypt, two souls: to the house of Jacob coming to Egypt, seventy.
And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to cast his face to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen.
And Joseph will harness his chariot, and will go up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he will be seen to him: and he will fall upon his neck, and will yet weep upon his neck.
And Israel will say to Joseph, Now will I die, after I saw thy face, because thou art yet living.
And Joseph will say to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up and announce to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren and my father's house which were in the land of Canaan, came to me.
And the men are shepherds of sheep, for they were men of cattle; and they brought their sheep and their cattle, and all which is to them.
And it will be when Pharaoh shall call to you and say, What your work?
And saying, Thy servants were men of cattle from our childhood and till now; also we, also our fathers; that ye shall dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to the Egyptians.
And Joseph will come and announce to Pharaoh, and will say, My father and my brethren, and their sheep and their cattle and all which is to them, came from the land of Canaan, and behold, in the land of Goshen.
And he took from the whole number of his brethren five men and set them before Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh will say to his brethren, What your work? and they will say to Pharaoh, Thy servants were feeding sheep, also we, also our fathers.
And they will say to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land we came: for no pasture is to the sheep which are to thy servants, for the famine was heavy in the land of Canaan: and at this time now will thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
And Pharaoh will speak to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren came to thee.
This land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land cause thy father and thy brethren to dwell; they shall dwell in the land of Goshen; and if thou knowest and there is among them men of strength, set them leaders of the cattle which are to me.
And Joseph will bring Jacob his father and will set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob will bless Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh will say to Jacob, How many the days of the years of thy life?
And Jacob will say to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojourning, thirty and a hundred years: little and evil were the days of the years of my life, and they reached not the days of the years of the life of my fathers in their sojournings.
And Jacob will bless Pharaoh, and he will go out from before Pharaoh.
And Joseph will place his father and his brethren, and will give to them possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, according to what Pharaoh commanded.
And Joseph will nourish his father and his brethren, and all the house of his father, with bread according to the mouth of the little ones.
And no bread in all the land; for the famine was heavy exceedingly, and the land of Egypt was exhausted, and the land of Canaan, from before the famine.
And Joseph will gather together all the silver being found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph will bring the silver to the house of Pharaoh.
And the silver will be spent from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan; and all the Egyptians will go to Joseph, saying, Give to us bread: and for what shall we die before thee? for the silver failed.
And Joseph will say, Give your cattle; and I will give to you for your cattle if silver failed.
And they will bring their cattle to Joseph, and Joseph will give to them bread for horses, and for the possession of the sheep, and for the possession of the cattle, and for the asses; and he will feed them with bread, for all their cattle for that year.
And that year will be ended, and they will come to him in the second year, and will say to him, We will not hide from my lord if the silver was spent; and the possession of the cattle to my lord; and there was not left before my lord except but our bodies and our lands.
For what shall we die before thine eyes, also we, also our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give seed, and we shall live and not die, and the land shall not be laid waste.
And Joseph will buy all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold each his field, for the famine was strong over them: and the land will be to Pharaoh.
And the people, he made them pass over to the cities from the extremity of the bounds of Egypt, and even to the extremity.
Only the land of the priests he bought not; for to the priests a portion from Pharaoh, and they ate their portion which Pharaoh gave to them; for this they sold not their lands.
And Joseph will say to the people, Behold, I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, seed for you, and sow ye the land.
And it was in the produce, and ye gave the fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be to you, for the seed of the field and for your food, and for those in your houses, and for food to your little ones.
And they will say, Thou didst preserve us alive: shall we find grace in the eyes of my lord, we were servants to Pharaoh.
And Joseph set it for an ordinance to this day, of the land of Egypt, for a fifth to Pharaoh; only the land of the priests alone was not to Pharaoh.
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the land of Goshen; and they will have possession in it, and be fruitful, and will multiply greatly.
And Jacob will live in the land of Egypt seventeen years: and the days of the years of the life of Jacob will be seven years and forty years, and a hundred years.
And the days of Israel will draw near to die: and he will call to his son Joseph, and will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, put now thy hand under my thigh, and thou shalt do to me kindness and truth: now thou shalt not bury me in Egypt.

This month is to you the beginning of months: this to you the first month of the year.
Speak ye to all the assembly of Israel, saying, In the tenth of this month and they shall take to them each a sheep, according to the house of the fathers; a sheep for a house.
And if the house shall be little from being for a sheep, and he taking, and his neighbor drawing nigh his house according to the number of souls; each according to the mouth of his eating shall ye reckon for the sheep.
A perfect sheep, a male, the son of a year, shall be to you from the he-lambs and from the goats ye shall take.
And it shall be to you for a preservation till the fourteenth day of this month; and they shall slaughter it, all the convocation of the assembly of Israel, between the two evenings.
And they took from the blood and gave upon the two door-posts, and upon the lintel within the houses which they shall eat it in them.
And they shall eat the flesh in that night roasted with fire and unleavened; upon bitter herbs shall they eat it.
Ye shall not eat from it raw and boiled from boiling with water, but roasted with fire, its head with its legs with its inner part.
Ye shall not leave from it till morning: and that remaining from it till morning, ye shall burn with fire.
And so shall ye eat it, your loins girded, your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand: and ye ate it in hasty flight; a passing over to Jehovah.
And I passed over in the land of Egypt in this night, and I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt from man even to quadruped: and against all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments: I Jehovah.
And the blood was to you for a sign upon the houses where you are there: and I saw the blood and I passed over you, and the blow shall not be upon you to destroy, in my striking upon the land of Egypt.
And this day shall be to you for a remembrance; and ye kept it a festival to Jehovah for your generations: ye shall keep a festival a law forever.
Seven days ye shall eat unleavened; wholly in the first day shall ye turn away leaven in your houses; for all eating leavened and that soul was destroyed from Israel from the first day even to the seventh day.
And in the first day a calling of holiness, and in the seventh day a calling of holiness shall be to you; every service shall not be done in them only what shall be eaten by every soul; this only shall be done by you.
And ye watched the unleavened; for in this self-same day I brought forth your armies out of the land of Egypt and watch ye this day for your generations a law forever.
In the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened till the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening.
Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses; for all eating from the leavened, that soul shall be destroyed from the assembly of Israel, for the sojourner or for the native of the land.
All leavened ye shall not eat: in all your dwellings ye shall eat unleavened.
And Moses will call for all the old men of Israel and he will say to them, Draw out and take to yourselves a sheep according to your tribes, and slaughter the passing over.
And take ye a bundle of hyssop, and dip in the blood that is upon the threshhold, and touch upon the lintel, and upon the two door-posts from the blood which is upon the threshhold and ye shall not come forth each from the door of his house till morning.
And Jehovah passed over to strike the Egyptians; and he saw the blood upon the lintel, and upon the two doorposts, and Jehovah passed by the door and will not give him destroying to come in to your houses to strike.
And watch ye this word for a law to thee and to thy sons forever.
And it shall be when ye shall come to the land which Jehovah will give to you, as he spake, watch ye this service.
And it shall be when your sons shall say to you, What this service to you?
And they said, This the sacrifice of the passing over to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt in his striking the Egyptians, and he delivered our houses. And the people will bow down and will worship.
And the sons of Israel will go, and will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron; thus did they.
And it will be in the middle of the night, and Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh sitting upon his throne, to the first-born of the captive which is in the house of the pit; and every first-born of the cattle.
And Pharaoh will rise up in the night, he and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there will be a great cry in Egypt: for not a house where there was not the dead there.
And he will call for Moses and for Aaron by night, and he will say, Arise, go forth from the midst of my people, also ye, also the sons of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah as ye spake.
Also your sheep, also your oxen take as ye spake, and go and bless also me.
And Egypt will be strong upon the people to hasten to send them forth out of the land; for they said, We are all dying.
And the people will take up their dough before it will be leavened, their kneading-bowls bound in their garments upon their shoulders.
And the sons of Israel did as Moses spake: and they will ask of the Egyptians, silver vessels and gold vessels, and garments.
And Jehovah gave favor to the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they will lend them; and they will strip the Egyptians.
And the sons of Israel will remove from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand footmen; men apart from the little ones.
And also a great mixture went up with them; and sheep and oxen, very much cattle.
And they will cook the dough which they brought out of Egypt unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they were driven out of Egypt, for they could not linger, and also they made not for themselves food.
And the dwelling of the sons of Israel which they dwelt in Egypt, was thirty years and four hundred years.
And it will be from the end of thirty years and four hundred years, in this self-same day all the armies of Jehovah will go forth out of the land of Egypt.
This a night of watchings to Jehovah, for bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt: it is this night to Jehovah of watching to all the sons of Israel for their generations.
And Jehovah will say to Moses and Aaron, This the law of the passing over: every son of a stranger shall not eat of it.
And every servant of a man bought with silver, and thou hast circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.
The sojourner and the hireling shall not eat of it.
In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not bring forth out of the house from the flesh without, and ye shall not break a bone of it.
All the assembly of Israel shall do it.
And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and do the passing over to Jehovah, all the males to him being circumcised, and then he shall draw near to do it; and he was as a native of the land: and every one uncircumcised shall not eat of it.
One law shall be to the native and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.
And all the sons of Israel will do as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
And it will be in this self-same day, Jehovah brought forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their armies.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Consecrate to me every first-born bursting open every womb among the sons of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is to me.
And Moses will say to the people, Remember this day which ye came forth out of Egypt, out of the house of servants; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you forth from here: and leavened shall not be eaten.
The day ye came forth in the month of Abib.
And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee forth to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; and do thou this service in this month.
Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day a festival to Jehovah.
Unleavened shall be eaten seven days: and leavened shall not be seen to thee in all thy bounds.
And announce to thy son in this day, saying, For this Jehovah did to me in my coming out of Egypt.
And it was to thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes; so that the law of Jehovah shall be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought thee forth out of Egypt.
And watch this law according to its appointment from days to days.
And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee to the land of the Canaanites, as he sware to thee and to thy fathers, and he gave it to thee.
And thou madest pass over all bursting open the womb, to Jehovah; and every one bursting forth young of the quadruped which shall be to thee; the males are to Jehovah.
And every first-born of the ass, thou shalt redeem with a sheep; and if thou shalt not redeem, thou shalt break his neck: and every first-born of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem.
And it was when thy son shall ask thee to-morrow, saying, What this? and thou saidst to him, With strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt from the house of servants.
And it shall be when Pharaoh was hard to send us forth, and Jehovah will kill every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man to the firstborn of cattle; for this I sacrifice to Jehovah all bursting forth the womb, the males; and all the first-born of my sons I will redeem.
And it was for a sign upon thy hand, and for bands between thine eyes: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought us forth from Egypt.
And it shall be in Pharaoh's sending forth the people, and God directed not the way of the land of the Philistines, for it is near; for God said, Lest the people shall grieve in their seeing war, and they turn back to Egypt.
And God will turn the people about the way of the desert, the sea of sedge: and the sons of Israel went up active out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses will take the bones of Joseph with him: for swearing he caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, For reviewing, God will review you; and carry up my bones with you from here.
And they will remove from Succoth, and they will encamp in Etham, in the extremity of the desert.
And Jehovah went before them the day in a pillar of cloud, to direct them the way; and the night in a pillar of fire to give light to them; to go the day and the night.
And the pillar of cloud will not give way, the day, and the pillar of fire, the night, before the people.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall turn back and shall encamp before the mouth of Hahiroth, between Migdol and between the sea, before Baal-Zephon: before them shall ye encamp by the sea.
And Pharaoh will say concerning the sons of Israel, They are wandering in perplexity in the land; the desert closed upon them.
And I bound fast Pharaoh's heart, and he pursued after them; and I will be honored in Pharaoh and all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they will do so.
And it was announced to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh will be turned, and his servants, against the people, and they will say, What this we did, that we sent forth Israel from serving us?
And he will harness his chariot, and he took his people with him.
And he will take six hundred chosen chariots, and all the horsemen of Egypt, and rulers over them all.
And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he will pursue after the sons of Israel: and the sons of Israel went forth with a high hand.
And the Egyptians will pursue after them, and they will enclose them, having encamped by the sea; all the horse, the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army, by the mouth of Hahiroth, before Baal-Zephon.
And Pharaoh drew near, and the sons of Israel will lift up their eyes, and behold, Egypt encamped behind them; and they will be exceedingly afraid: and the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah.
And they will say to Moses, Because no tombs are in Egypt, didst thou take us to die in the desert? what this thou didst to us to bring us forth out of Egypt?
Is not this the word which we spake to thee in Egypt, saying, Desist from us, and we will serve the Egyptians? For it is good to us to serve Egypt rather than that we died in the desert.
And Moses will say to the people, Ye shall not fear; stand ye and see the deliverance of Jehovah, which he will do to you this day: for the Egyptians whom ye saw this day, ye shall not add to see them more forever.
Jehovah will wage war for you and ye shall be silent.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Why wilt thou cry to me? speak to the sons of Israel and they shall remove.
And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and break it up: and the sons of Israel shall go in the midst of the sea on dry land.
And I, behold me binding fast the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall go after them: and I will be honored in Pharaoh, and upon all his army, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.
And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah in the getting me honor in Pharaoh, in his chariots and in his horsemen.
And the messenger of God going before the camp of Israel will remove, and will go from behind them; and the pillar of the cloud will remove from before them, and will stand from behind them,
And it will come between the camp of Egypt and between the camp of Israel; and it will be the cloud, and the darkness, and it will make the night light: and this drew not near to this all the night.
And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and Jehovah will cause the sea to go by a strong east wind all the night; and he will set the sea for dry land, and the waters will be rent.
And the sons of Israel will go in the midst of the sea on dry land; and the waters to them a wall from their right hand and from their left.
And the Egyptians will pursue and will go after them, all the horse of Pharaoh and his chariots and his horsemen to the midst of the sea.
And it will be in the watch of the morning, Jehovah will look forth to the camp of Egypt in the pillar of fire and the cloud, and he will disturb the camp of Egypt.
And he will remove the wheel of their chariots, and they will drive in heaviness; and Egypt will say, I will flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah waged war for them against Egypt.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand over the sea, and the waters shall turn back upon Egypt, upon its chariots and upon its horsemen.
And Moses will stretch forth his hand over the sea, and the sea will turn back before the morning to its perpetuity. And the Egyptians fled at meeting it, and Jehovah will shake off Egypt in the midst of the sea.
And the waters will turn back, and will cover the chariots and the horsemen, to all Pharaoh's army coming after them into the sea: and there was not left among them even one.
And the sons of Israel came upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were to them a wall from the right hand and from the left.
And Jehovah will save Israel in that day, from the hand of Egypt: and Israel will see the Egyptians dead upon the lip of the sea.
And Israel will see the great hand which Jehovah did upon Egypt; and the people will fear Jehovah, and they will believe in Jehovah, and in Moses his servant.
Then will Moses sing, and the sons of Israel, this song to Jehovah; and they will speak, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for exalting himself, he was exalted: the horse and his horsemen he threw into the sea.
Jehovah my strength and song, and he shall be to me for salvation: this my God, and I will cause him to rest; the God of my father, and I will exalt him.
Jehovah, a man of war: Jehovah his name.
The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he threw into the sea; his chosen rulers sank in the sea of sedge.
The depths will cover them: they will go down into the deep as a stone.
Thy right hand, Jehovah, was magnified in strength: thy right hand, Jehovah, will break in pieces the enemy.
And in the multitude of thy majesty thou wilt destroy those rising up against thee: thou wilt send forth thine anger; it shall eat them as straw.
And by the spirit of thine anger the waters shook them off, the flowings stood up as a heap: the depths were contracted in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will enclose, I will divide the spoil: my soul shall be filled with them: I will draw out my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.
Thou didst blow with thy spirit; the sea covered them: they rolled down as lead in the great waters.
Who like thee among the gods, O Jehovah? who like thee magnified in in holiness, wonderful in praise, doing a wonder?
Thou didst stretch forth thy right hand, the earth will swallow them.
Thou didst lead in thy kindness this people thou didst redeem: thou didst conduct with thy strength to thy holy dwelling.
The peoples heard, and they will be angry: pain took those inhabiting Philistia.
Then the chiefs of Edom trembled; the mighty of Moab, trembling, shall take them; all those dwelling in Canaan melted away.
Dread shall fall upon them and terror: by the greatness of thine arm they shall be dumb as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Jehovah: till this people pass over, thou didst buy.
Thou shalt bring them in and shalt plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, into the place of thy Sabbath, thou didst make, O Jehovah: a holy place, O Jehovah, which thy hands prepared.
Jehovah shall reign forever and yet.
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen, into the sea, and Jehovah will turn back over them the water of the sea: and the sons of Israel went on the dry land in the midst of the sea.
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, will take the drum in her hand; and all the women will go forth after her, with drums and with lutes.
And Miriam will sing to them, Sing ye to Jehovah; for being lifted up, he was lifted up: the horse and his horseman he threw into the sea.
And Moses will remove Israel from the sea of sedge, and they will come forth to the desert of Shur; and they will go three days into the desert, and they found not water.
And they will come to Marah, and they will not be able to drink the waters of Marah, for they are bitter: for this he called the name bitterness.
And the people will murmur against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
And he will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will show him a tree, and he will cast into the waters, and the waters will become sweet: then he set to him a law and judgment, and there he tried him.
And he will say, If hearkening thou wilt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt do the right in his eyes, and give ear to his commands, and watch all his laws, every disease which I put upon Egypt I will not put upon thee: for I am Jehovah healing thee.
And they will come to Ailam; and twelve fountains of water there, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
And they will remove from Ailam, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel will come to the desert of Sin, which is between Ailam and between Sinai, the fifteenth day of the second month of their coming out of the land of Egypt.
And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the desert.
And the sons of Israel will say to them, Who will give to die by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt in our sitting by the pot of flesh, in our eating bread to satiety? for ye brought us forth to this desert to kill all this convocation with hunger.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me raining for you bread from the heavens; and the people shall go forth and shall gather the word of a day in its day, so that I shall try them, whether they will go in my law or not.
And it was in the sixth day, and they prepared what they shall bring in; and it was double to what they will gather day by day.
And Moses will say, and Aaron, to all the sons of Israel, The evening, and ye knew that Jehovah brought you out of the land of Egypt:
And the morning, and ye saw the glory of Jehovah, in his hearing your murmurings against Jehovah and what are we that ye will murmur against us?
And Moses will say, In Jehovah giving you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety; in Jehovah hearing your murmurings which ye murmured against him: and what are we? not against us your murmurings but against Jehovah.
And Moses will say to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah: for he heard your murmurings.
And it shall be as Aaron spake to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and they will turn to the desert, and behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
I heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye knew that I am Jehovah your God.
And it shall be in the evening, the quail shall come up and shall cover the camp: and in the morning the dew was lying round about the camp.
And the dew lying will go up, and behold, upon the face of the desert a small thing being peeled off thin, as pitch upon the earth.
And the sons of Israel will see, and they will say, each to his brother, What this? for they knew not what it was And Moses will say to them, This the bread which Jehovah gave to you to eat.
This the word which Jehovah commanded, Gather ye from it, each according to the mouth of his eating: an omer for the head from the numbering of your souls, ye shall take each for those in his tent.
And the sons of Israel will do so, and they will gather this much, and this little.
And they will measure by the handful, and the abundance did not exceed, and the little was not diminished: they gathered a man according to the mouth of his eating.
And Moses will say to them, No man shall leave from it till morning.
And they heard not to Moses; and the men will leave from it till morning, and it will rot with worms, and it will stink: and Moses will be angry with them.
And they will gather it in the morning by morning, a man according to the mouth of his eating: and the sun was hot and it melted.
And it will be in the sixth day, they gathered double the bread, two handfuls for one; and all the chiefs of the assembly will come and announce to Moses.
And he will say to them, This what Jehovah spake, To-morrow the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: what ye will cook, cook; and what ye will boil, boil; and all exceeding, leave for you for preservation till the morning.
And they left it till morning as Moses commanded: and it did not stink, and no worm was in it.
And Moses will say, Eat this day; for the Sabbath this day to Jehovah: this day ye shall not find in the field.
Six days ye shall gather, and in the seventh day, the Sabbath, it shall not be in it.
And it will be in the seventh day, and they will go forth from the people to gather, and they found not.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, How long refused ye to watch my commands and my law?
See, for Jehovah gave to you the Sabbath; for this be gave to you in the sixth day, bread of two days: sit ye each in his station; a man shall not go forth from his place in the seventh day.
And the people shall rest in the seventh day.
And the house of Israel will call its name portion: as the seed of coriander, white, and its taste as a flat cake with honey.
And Moses will say, This the word which Jehovah commanded, Fill the omer from it for a preservation to your generations; so that they shall see the bread which I gave you to eat in the desert in my bringing you forth out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses will say to Aaron, Take one vase and give there an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah for a preservation to your generations.
As Jehovah commanded Moses, and Aaron will deposit it before the testimony for preservation.
And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years till they came to a land inhabited: they ate the portion till they came to the extremity of the land of Canaan.
And the omer the tenth of this ephah.
And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will remove from the desert of Sin, according to their removings by the mouth of Jehovah; and they will encamp in Rephidim; and no water for the people to drink.
And the people contended with Moses, and they will say, Give to us water and we will drink. And Moses will say to them, Why will ye contend with me, and why will ye tempt Jehovah?
And the people will thirst there for water; and the people will murmur against Moses, and will say, For what this did ye bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our sons and our cattle with thirst?
And Moses will cry to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? yet a little and they will stone me.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Pass over before the people and take with thee from the old men of Israel; and thy rod which thou didst strike with it the river, take in thy hand and go.
And behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and strike upon the rock, and waters shall come forth from it, and the people drank. And Moses will do so before the eyes of the old men of Israel.
And he will call the name of the place, Temptation, and Strife, for the contention of the sons of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah in the midst of us or not?
And Amalek will come and will wage war with Israel, in Rephidim.
And Moses will say to Joshua, Choose to us men, and go forth, wage war with Amalek: to-morrow I stand upon the head of the hill and the rod of God in my band.
And Joshua will do as Moses said to him to wage war with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron and Hur, went up to the head of the hill.
And it was as Moses will lift up his hand, Israel prevailed: and as he will put down his hand and Amalek prevailed.
And the hands of Moses were heavy; and they will take a stone and put under him, and he will sit upon it: and Aaron and Hur took hold upon his hands, one from here, and one from there; and his hands will be in firmness till the sun went forth.
And Joshua will overthrow Amalek and his people with the mouth of the sword.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Write this a remembrance in the book, and set in the ears of Joshua: for wiping off I will wipe off the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
And Moses will build an altar, and he will call its name, Jehovah my Standard.
For he will say, Because the hand upon the throne of Jehovah, war to Jehovah with Amalek from generation to generation.
And Jethro, priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, will hear all which God did to Moses and to Israel his people, for Jehovah brought forth Israel out of Egypt:
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will take Zipporah, Moses' wife, after her sending forth,
And her two sons, which the name of the one Gershom, for he said I was a stranger in a strange land;
And the name of the one Eliezer; for the God of my father for my help, and he will take me away from the sword of Pharaoh.
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will come, and and his sons and his wife, to Moses to the desert, where he encamped there in the mountain of God.
And he will say to Moses, I thy father-in-law, Jethro, came to thee, and thy wife and her two sons with her.
And Moses will go forth to the meeting of his father-in-law, and will worship him and kiss him: and they will ask each his friend of peace; and they will come into the tent.
And Moses will recount to his father-in-law all which Jehovah did to Pharaoh, and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the distress which found them in the way; and Jehovah will deliver them.
And Jethro will rejoice for all the good which Jehovah did to Israel, whom he took away out of the hand of Egypt.
And Jethro will say, Praised be Jehovah who took you away out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who took away the people from under the hand of Egypt.
Now I knew that Jehovah is great above all gods; for in the word they acted proudly over them.
And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, will take a burnt-offering and sacrifices to God: and Aaron will come, and all the old men of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
And it will be on the morrow, and Moses will sit to judge the people: and they will stand by Moses from the morning to the evening.
And Moses' father-in-law will see all which he did for the people, and he will say, What this thou doest to the people? Wherefore wilt thou sit alone by thyself, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?
And Moses will say to his father-in-law, Because the people will come to me to seek God.
For when the word will be to them, they came to me, and I judged between a man and between his friend, and I made known the laws of God and his precepts.
And Moses' father-in-law will say to him, The word is not good which thou doest.
Fading, thou wilt fade away, also thou, also this people that is with thee: for this word is heavy for thee; thou wilt not be able to do it thyself alone.
Now hear to my voice, I will advise thee, and God will be with thee: be thou for the people towards God, and bring thou their words to God;
And teach them the laws and the precepts and make known to them the way they shall go in it, and the work which they shall do.
And thou shalt look out from all the people men of ability, fearing God, men of truth, men hating gain; and set thou over them chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of ten.
And they judged the people in all time: and it will be every great word they will bring to thee, and every small word they shall judge: and it will be light for thee, and they shall lift up with thee.
If thou shalt do this word, and God commanded thee, and thou shalt be able to stand, and all this people shall go to their place in peace.
And Moses will hear to the voice of Jethro, and will do all that he said.
And Moses will choose men of ability from all Israel, and he will give them heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, chiefs of ten.
And they judged the people in all time; and the hard word they brought to Moses, and every small word they will judge themselves.
And Moses will, send away his father-in-law, and he will go for himself to his land.
In the third month, in the coming forth of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in that day they came to the desert of Sinai.
And they will remove from Rephidim, and they will come to the desert of Sinai, and they will encamp in the desert; and Israel will encamp there before the mountain.
And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah will call to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and shalt announce to the sons of Israel:
Ye saw what I did to Egypt, and I will lift you up upon the wings of eagles, and I will bring you to me.
And now if hearing, ye shall hear to my voice, and watch my covenant, and ye were to me wealth above all peoples, for to me is all the earth.
And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These the words which thou shalt speak to the sons of Israel.
And Moses will go and will call to the old men of the people, and he will set before them all these words that Jehovah commanded him.
And all the people will answer together, and will say, All which Jehovah spake, we will do. And Moses turned back the words of the people to Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me coming to thee in the darkness of the cloud, so that the people shall hear in my speaking with thee, and also in thee shall they believe forever. And Moses will announce the words of the people to Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to the people and consecrate them this day, and the morrow; and they washed their garments,
And be ye prepared for the third day, for in the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people upon mount Sinai.
And set bounds to the people round about, saying, Watch for yourselves to go up into the mount, and to touch upon its extremity: every one touching upon the mount, dying, shall die.
No hand shall touch upon it, for being stoned, he shall be stoned, or being shot, shall be shot; whether quadruped or man, it shall not live: in protracting the shouting, they shall go up upon the mount.
And Moses will come down from the mount to the people, and he will consecrate the people; and they will wash their garments.
And he will say to the people, Be prepared; for three days ye shall not come near to a woman.
And it shall be in the third day, it being in the morning, and there shall be voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly strong; and all the people in the camp will tremble.
And Moses will bring forth the people to the meeting of God out of the camp; and they will stand in the lower parts of the mount.
And mount Sinai smoked all of it, because that Jehovah came down upon it in fire: and its smoke will go up as the smoke of the furnace, and all the mountain will tremble exceedingly.
And the voice of the trumpet will be going and strengthening exceedingly, Moses will speak and God will answer him by a voice.
And Jehovah will come down upon mount Sinai to the head of the mount: and Jehovah will call for Moses to the head of the mount and Moses will go up.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go down: protest to the people lest they shall break in to Jehovah to see, and a multitude fall from them.
And also the priests drawing near to Jehovah, shall be consecrated, lest Jehovah shall break forth upon them.
And Moses will say to Jehovah, The people shall not be able to come up to mount Sinai, for thou didst protest to us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain, and consecrate it.
And Jehovah will say to him, Go; come down, and come up, thou and Aaron with thee: and the priests and the people shall not break in to come up to Jehovah lest he shall break forth upon them.
And Moses will come down to the people and will say to them.
And God will speak all these words, saying,
I am Jehovah thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.
There shall be no other God to thee to my face.
Thou shalt not make to thee a carved image, and every appearance that is in the heavens above, and that is in the earth beneath, and that is in the water under the earth.
Thou shalt not worship to them, and thou shalt not serve them: for I am Jehovah thy God, a jealous God, striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth, to them hating me;
And doing kindness to thousands to them loving me and to them watching my commands.
Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain: for Jehovah will not cleanse him who shall take his name in vain.
Remember the day of the Sabbath to consecrate it.
Six days thou shalt work and do all thy service:
And the seventh day the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shall do no service, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy servant, and thy maid, and thy cattle, and thy stranger which is in thy gates.
For six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all which is in them, and he will rest in the seventh day: for this Jehovah praised the seventh day and consecrated it.
Honor thy father and thy mother, so that thy days shall be prolonged upon the land which Jehovah thy gave to thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not testify against thy friend for falsehood.
Thou shalt not desire thy friend's house, thou shalt not desire thy friend's wife, and his servant and his maid and his ox and his ass and all which is to thy friend.
And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and the people feared, and they will shake, and they will stand from far off.
And they will say to Moses, Speak thou with us and we will hear: and God shall not speak with us lest we shall die.
And Moses will say to the people, Ye shall not fear; for for this cause God came to try you, that his fear shall be to your faces, so that ye shall not sin.
And the people will stand from far off, and Moses will draw near to the darkness where God is there.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, Ye saw that from the heavens I spake with you.
Ye shall not make to me gods of silver, and gods of gold ye shall not make to yourselves.
An altar of earth shalt thou make to me, and sacrifice upon it thy burnt-offering and thy peace, and thy sheep and thy cattle: and in every place where I shall cause my name to be remembered, I will come to thee and bless thee.
And if thou shalt make to me an altar of stones, thou shalt not build them, cutting, for didst thou lift up thy sword upon it, and thou shalt defile it.
And thou shalt not go up by steps upon mine altar, that thou shalt not uncover thy nakedness upon it.
And these the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve: and in the seventh he shall go forth free gratuitously.

And Jehovah will call to Moses, and speak to him from the tent of appointment, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, A man when he shall bring near from you an offering to Jehovah, from the cattle, from the oxen and from the sheep, ye shall bring near your offering.
If a burnt-offering, his sacrifice from the oxen, a blameless male: they shall bring it near to the door of the tent of appointment; he shall bring it near according to his will before Jehovah.

And the remainder from the gift for Aaron and for his sons: holy of holies, from the sacrifices to Jehovah.
Every gift which ye shall bring near to Jehovah shall not be made leavened: for all leaven and all honey ye shall not burn from it a sacrifice to Jehovah.

And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a soul shall sin in error from all the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done, and doing from after any of them:
If the priest being anointed shall sin according to the guilt of the people; and he brought for his sin which he sinned, a bullock, the son of a cow, blameless to Jehovah for the sin.
And he brought the bullock to the door of the tent of appointment, before Jehovah; and he placed his hand upon the head of the bullock, and slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
And the priest being anointed, took the blood of the bullock, and brought it to the tent of appointment.

And the priest gave from the blood upon the horns of the altar of the incense of aromatics before Jehovah, which is in the tent of appointment; and all the blood of the bullock he shall pour out at the foundation of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of appointment.
And all the fat of the bullock of the sin, he shall lift up from it: the fat covering over the bowels, and all the fat which is upon the bowels.
And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, upon the kidneys, he shall take it away,
As it shall be lifted up from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace: and the priest burnt them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
And the skin of the bullock and all its flesh with its head and with its legs, and its bowels and its dung,
And he brought forth all the bullock to from without the camp to a clean place, to the pouring out of the ashes, and burnt it upon the wood in fire: upon the pouring out of the ashes it shall be burnt.
And if all the assembly of Israel shall err, and the word was hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they did behind from the commands of Jehovah, which shall not be done, and they were guilty,
And the sin which they sinned against it being known, and the assembly brought a bullock, the son of a cow, for the sin, and they brought it before the tent of appointment.
And the old men of the assembly placed their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah: and slaughtered the bullock before Jehovah.
And the priest being anointed brought the blood of the bullock to the tent of appointment.
And the priest dipped his finger from the blood and sprinkled seven times before Jehovah, before the vail.
And from the blood he will give upon the horns of the altar, which is before Jehovah in the tent of appointment, and he shall pour out all the blood at the foundation of the altar of the burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of appointment.

And he brought forth the bullock from without the camp, and he burnt it as he burnt the first bullock: it is the sin of the assembly:
When a chief shall sin, and do one from all the commands of Jehovah his God, which he shall not do in erring, and being guilty,
Or his sin being made known to him while he sinned in it; and he brought his offering, a he goat of the goats, a blameless male.
And he placed his hand upon the head of the goat, in the place where he shall slaughter the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is sin.

And all the fat he shall burn upon the altar as the fat of the sacrifice of peace: and the priest expiated for him from his sin, and it was forgiven to him.
And if one shall sin from the people of the land in erring, in doing one from the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done, and being guilty;
Or his sin being made known to him which he sinned: and he brought a she goat of the goats, a blameless female for his sin which he sinned.
And he placed his hand upon the head of the sin, and he slaughtered the sin in the place of the burnt-offering.
And the priest took from its blood with his finger, and gave upon the horns of the altar of the burnt-offering; and all the blood he will pour out at the foundation of the altar.

And when a soul shall sin, and he heard the voice of an oath, and he a witness, if he saw or knew; if he shall not announce, he bore his sin.
Or when a soul shall touch upon any unclean thing, if upon a carcase of an unclean beast, or upon the carcase of unclean cattle, or upon the carcase of an unclean creeping thing, and it was hidden from him: and he is unclean and guilty.
Or when he shall touch upon the uncleanness of man, for all uncleanness which he shall be unclean in it, and it was hidden from him; and he shall know, and be guilty.
Or when a soul shall swear to talk idly with his lips for evil, or for good, for all which the man shall talk idly with an oath, and it was hid from him; and he shall know, and be guilty for one from these.
And it was when he shall be guilty for one from these, and he shall confess that he sinned upon it.
And he brought his trespass to Jehovah for his sin which he sinned, a female from the sheep, a lamb or she goat of the goats, for the sin; and the priest expiated for him from his sin,
And if his hand shall not reach the sufficiency of a sheep, and he brought his trespass which he sinned, two turtledoves, or two sons of a dove, to Jehovah; one for the sin, and one for the burnt-offering.
And he brought them to the priest, and he brought near that for the sin first, and broke off its head from the front of its neck; and he shall not divide.
And he sprinkled from the blood of the sin upon the wall of the altar; and that remaining of the blood he shall press out at the foundation of the altar: it is sin.
And the second he shall make a burnt-offering according to the judgment: and the priest expiated for him from his sin which he sinned, and it was forgiven to him.
And if his hand shall not reach to the two turtle-doves, or to the two sons of a dove; and he brought his offering who sinned, the tenth of the ephah of fine flour for the sin; he shall not put oil upon it, and he shall not give frankincense upon it; for it is sin.
And he brought it to the priest, and the priest pressed from it his hand full, its memorial, and burnt upon the altar for sacrifices to Jehovah: it is sin.
And the priest shall expiate for him for his sin which he sinned, from one from these; and it was forgiven to him: and it was to the priest for a gift.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
When a soul shall cover transgression and sin in erring from the holy things of Jehovah; and he brought his trespass to Jehovah, a blameless ram from the sheep, by thy estimation of shekels of silver, by the shekel of the holy place, for the trespass.
And what he sinned from the holy place he shall recompense, and he shall add its fifth upon it, and he gave it to the priest: and the priest shall expiate for him with the ram of the trespass, and it was forgiven to him.
And if a soul shall sin and do one from all the commands of Jehovah which shall not be done; and he knew not, and he was guilty, and bore his sin.
And he brought a blameless ram from the sheep, by thy estimation, for the trespass to the priest; and the priest expiated for him for his error which he erred and he knew not; and it was forgiven to him.
It is guilt: being guilty, he trespassed to Jehovah.

These are unclean to you, among all the creeping: every one touching upon them in their dying, shall be unclean till even.

This the law of cattle, and of bird, and of every living soul creeping in the water, and for every soul creeping upon the earth.
To separate between the unclean and between the clean, and between the beast being eaten and between the beast which shall not be eaten.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a woman shall bear seed and bring forth a male, and she was unclean seven days: according to the days of removal of being sick she shall be unclean.
And in the eighth day the flesh of his uncircumcision shall be circumcised.
And thirty days and three days, she shall sit down in the blood of purification: she shall not touch upon any holy thing, and into the holy place she shall not come till the completing of the days of her purification.
And if she shall bear a female, and she was unclean two sevens, as her removal: and sixty days and six days she shall sit down upon the blood of her purification.
And in completing the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and the son of a dove, or a turtle-dove, for the sin, to the door of the tent of appointment, to the priest.
And he offered it before Jehovah, and expiated for her, and cleansed her from the flowing of her blood. This the law of the bringing forth for a male, or for a female.
And if her hand shall not find the sufficiency of a sheep, and she took two turtle-doves or two sons of the dove; one for a burnt-offering, and one for sin: and the priest expiated for her, and she was clean.

When to a man there shall be a lifting up in the skin of his flesh, or a scab, or brightness, and it was in the skin of his flesh for the stroke of leprosy; and he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.
And the priest saw the stroke in the skin of the flesh: and the hair in the stroke turned white, and the sight of the stroke deep from the skin of his flesh, it is the stroke of leprosy: and the priest saw him and defiled him.
And if the brightness it white in the skin of his flesh, and its sight not deep from the skin, and the hair not turned white; and the priest shut up the stroke seven days.
And the priest saw him in the seventh day: and behold, the stroke stood; in his eyes, the stroke spread not in the skin, and the priest shut him up the second seven days.
And the priest saw him in the seventh day, the second time, and behold, the stroke dim, and the stroke spread not in the skin, and the priest cleansed him: it is a scab: and he washed his garments and was clean.
And if spreading, the scab shall spread in the skin, after his being seen to the priest for his cleansing, and he was seen the second time to the priest.
And the priest saw, and behold, the scab spread in the skin, and the priest defiled him: it is leprosy.
When the stroke of leprosy shall be in a man, and he shall be brought to the priest:
And the priest saw, and behold, a lifting up white in the skin, and it turned the hair white, and the quickening of living flesh in the lifting up:
It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall defile him; he shall not shut him up for he is unclean.
And if breaking out, the leprosy shall break out in the skin, and the leprosy covered all the skin, the stroke from his head and even to his feet, to all the sight of the eyes of the priest:
And the priest saw, and behold, the leprosy covered all his flesh, and he cleansed the stroke: all of it turned white: he is clean.
In the day of seeing in him the living flesh, he shall be unclean.
And the priest saw the living flesh, and he defiled him: the living flesh it is unclean: it is leprosy.

And the priest saw him, and behold, the stroke turned to white; and the priest cleansed the stroke: he is clean.
And when the flesh shall be in it, in his skin, a burning sore, and was healed,
And there was in the place of the burning sore a white rising, or brightness, white, reddish, and he was seen to the priest;
And the priest saw, and behold, the sight low from the skin, and its hair turned white: and the priest defiled him: it is the stroke of leprosy broken out in the burning sore.
And if the priest shall see it, and behold, no white hair in it, and it not low from the skin, and it was dim; and the priest shut him up seven days:
And if spreading, it shall spread in the skin, and the priest defiled him: it the stroke.
And if the brightness shall stand still, lowest, spreading not, it the scar of the burning sore; and the priest cleansed him.
Or when there shall be flesh in his skin a burning of fire, and there was a quickening of the burning, a brightness reddish white, or white;

And the priest saw the stroke, and behold, its sight deep from the skin, and in it thin, yellow hair; and the priest defiled him: it a scall, it a leprosy of the head, or of the beard.
And when the priest shall see the stroke of the scall, and behold, its sight not deep from the skin, and no black hair in it; and the priest shut up the stroke of the scall seven days.
And the priest saw the stroke in the seventh day: and behold, the scab spread not, and there was no yellow hair in it, and the sight of the scall not deep from the skin;
And he was shaved, and the scall he shall not shave, and the priest shut up the scall seven days the second time.
And the priest saw the scall in the seventh day, and behold, the scall spread not in the skin, and its sight not deep from the skin; and the priest cleansed him; and he washed his garments and was clean.
And if spreading, the scall shall spread in the skin after his purification;
And the priest saw him: and behold, the scall spread in the skin, the priest shall not search for yellow hair; he is unclean.
And if in his eyes the scall stood still, and black hair sprang up in it, the scall was healed; he is clean: and the priest cleansed him.

And if a man when his head shall become bald, he being bald; he is clean.
And if from the side of his face his head shall become bald, he is bald; he is clean.
And when there shall be in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front, a stroke, reddish white, it is a leprosy broken out in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front.
And the priest saw it, and behold, the rising of the stroke, a reddish white, in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front, as the sight of leprosy, in the skin of the flesh;
He a leprous man, he unclean: he being unclean the priest shall defile him; his stroke in his head.
And the leprous in whom the stroke, his garments shall be rent, and his head shall be uncovered, and upon the lips he shall be covered, and he shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
All the days which the stroke is in him, he shall be unclean: he is unclean: he shall dwell separately; without the camp is his dwelling.
When a garment the stroke of leprosy shall be in it, whether in the garment of wool or in the garment of linen;
Or in the warp, or in the woof, to the linen or to the wool: or in the skin, or in any work of skin:
And the stroke was greenish, or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin; it is the stroke of leprosy, and it was seen to the priest.
And the priest saw the stroke, and shut up the stroke seven days.
And he saw the stroke in the seventh day: when the stroke spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, and all which made of skin for work; the stroke a painful leprosy; it unclean.
And he burnt the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or in wool, or in linen, or any vessel of skin which shall be in it the stroke: for it a painful leprosy; in fire shall it be burnt.
And if the priest shall see, and behold, the stroke spread not in the garment, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin;
And the priest commanded, and they washed that in which was the stroke, and he shut it up seven days, the second time.
And the priest saw after the washing, the stroke, and behold, the stroke turned not its eye, and the stroke spread not; it unclean; in fire thou shalt burn it; it a hollow in his baldness behind, or in his baldness in front.
And if the priest saw, and behold, the stroke dim after washing it: he rent it out of the garment or from the skin, or from the warp, or from the woof.
And if it shall be seen still in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel of skin; it is breaking out: in the fire thou shalt burn it, that in which is the stroke.
And the garment, or the warp or the woof, or any vessel of skin which thou shalt wash, and the stroke departed from them, and it was washed the second time, and it was clean.
This the law of the stroke of leprosy of the garment of wool, or of linen, or the warp or the woof, or every vessel of skin, to cleanse it or to defile it.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
This shall be the law of the leprous in the day of his cleansing: he was brought to the priest.
And the priest shall go forth without the camp: and the priest saw, and behold, the stroke of leprosy was healed from the leprous.
And the priest commanded, and took for him being cleansed, two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and double scarlet, and hyssop.
And the priest commanded, and killed one of the birds into a vessel of earthen, over living water.
The living bird he will take it, and the cedar wood and the double scarlet, and the hyssop, and he dipped them and the living bird in the blood of the bird slain over the living water.
And he sprinkled upon him, being cleansed from the leprosy, seven times and cleansed him, and he sent forth the living bird upon the face of the field.
And he being cleansed, washed his garments and shaved all his hair, and washed in water and was clean: and afterwards he shall come into the camp and dwelt without his tent seven days.
And it was in the seventh day, he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and the front of his eyes; and all his hair shall he shave off; and he washed his garments, and washed his flesh in water, and was clean.
And in the eighth day he shall take two blameless lambs, and one blameless ewe lamb, the daughter of her year, and three tenths of fine flour, a gift mingled with oil, and one measure of oil.
And the priest cleansing, made the man being cleansed stand, and the things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment.
And the priest took one he lamb and brought him near for trespass, and the measure of oil, and lifted them up, a waving before Jehovah.
And he slaughtered the lamb in the place where he shall slaughter the sin and the burnt-offering, in the holy place: for as the sin the trespass, it is to the priest; it is the holy of holies.
And the priest took from the blood of the trespass, and the priest gave upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
And the priest took from the measure of oil, and poured upon the priest's left hand.
And the priest dipped his right finger from the oil which upon his left hand, and he sprinkled from the oil with his finger, seven times before Jehovah.
And from the remainder of the oil which was upon his hand, the priest will give upon the extremity of the right ear of hint being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass.
And that remaining of the oil which was upon the priest's hand, he will give upon the head of him being cleansed, and the priest expiated for him before Jehovah.
And the priest did the sin, and expiated for him being cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterwards he will slaughter the burnt-offering.
And the priest brought up the burnt-offering and the gift upon the altar: and the priest expiated for him, and he was cleansed.
And if he be poor, and his hand attaining not; and he took one lamb a trespass, for a waving to expiate for him, and one tenth of fine flour mingled with oil, for the gift, and a measure of oil.
And two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, which his hand shall attain; and one was the sin, and one the burnt-offering.
And he brought them in the eighth day for his cleansing, to the priest at the door of the tent of appointment before Jehovah.
And the priest took the lamb of the trespass and the measure of oil, and the priest lifted them up, a waving before Jehovah.
And he slaughtered the lamb of the trespass, and the priest took from the blood of the trespass, and gave upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:
And from the oil the priest poured out upon the priest's left hand.
And the priest sprinkled with his right finger from the oil which was upon his left hand, seven times, before Jehovah.
And the priest gave from the oil which was upon his hand, upon the extremity of the right ear of him being cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass.
And that remaining from the oil which was upon the priest's hand, he will give upon the head of him being cleansed; and he expiated for him before Jehovah.
And he did the one from the turtle-doves, or from the sons of the dove, from what his hand shall attain.
What his hand shall attain, the one the sin, and the one the burnt-offering upon the gift. And the priest expiated for him being cleansed, before Jehovah.
This the law of him in whom the stroke of leprosy, which his hand attained not in his cleansing.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
When ye shall come into the land of Canaan which I give to you for a possession, and I gave the stroke of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
And he to whom is the house, came and announced to the priest, saying, It was seen to me as a stroke in the house.
And the priest commanded, and they cleared the house, before the priest shall go in to see the stroke, and all which is in the house shall not be unclean; and after this the priest shall go in to see the house.
And he saw the stroke; and behold, the stroke in the walls of the house, the hollows greenish, or reddish and their sight low from the wall.
And the priest shall go forth from the house to the door of the house, and he shut up the house seven days.
And the priest turned back in the seventh day, and saw, and behold, the stroke spread in the walls of the house.
And the priest commanded, and they took away the stones which in them was the stroke, and they cast them without the city into an unclean place.
And he shall scrape the house from within round about, and they poured out the dust which they scraped off without the city, into an unclean place.
And they took other stones and brought instead of these stones; and he shall take other clay and spread over the house.
And if the stroke shall turn back and break out in the house after he took away the stones, and after he scraped off the house, and after it was spread over;
And the priest came and saw, and behold, the stroke spread in the house; it a painful leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
And he tore down the house, and its stones, and its wood, and all the dust of the house: and he brought forth without the city, into an unclean place.
And he coming in to the house all the days it is shut up, shall be unclean till the evening.
And he lying in the house shall wash his garments: and he eating in the house shall wash his garments.
And if the priest coming in, shall come in and see, and behold, the stroke spread not in the house after spreading over the house: and the priest cleansed the house, for the stroke was healed.
And he took to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and double scarlet, and hyssop.
And he slaughtered the one bird into a vessel of earthen, over living water.
And he took the cedar wood, and the hyssop and the double scarlet, and the living bird, and dipped them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the living water, and sprinkled into the house seven times.
And he cleansed the house with the blood of the bird in living water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the double scarlet.
And he sent away the living bird without the city to the face of the field, and he expiated for the house: and it was clean.
This the law for every stroke of leprosy and for scall,
And for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a brightness;
And to teach in the day of being unclean, and in the day of cleansing: this the law of leprosy.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man, a man, there shall be a flowing from his flesh, his flowing unclean.
And this shall be his uncleanness in his flowing: his flesh running with his flowing, or his flesh sealed up from his flowing, it is his uncleanness.
Every bed which he flowing shall lie upon it, shall be unclean: and every vessel which he shall sit upon it, shall be unclean.
And a man who shall touch upon his bed, shall cleanse his garments and shall wash in water, and be unclean till evening.
And he sitting upon a vessel which he flowing, shall sit upon it, shall cleanse his garments, and wash in water, and shall be unclean till the evening.
And he touching upon the flesh of him flowing, shall wash his garments, and wash in water, and shall be unclean till the evening.
And if he flowing shall spit upon the clean; and he washed his garments, and washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.

And every one touching upon any thing which shall be under him, shall be unclean till the evening: and he lifting up these things, shall wash his garments, and he washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
And every one which he flowing shall touch upon him (and washed not his hands in water), he washed his garments, and washed in water and was unclean till the evening.
And the vessel of earthen which he flowing shall touch upon it, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be washed in water.
And when he flowing shall be cleansed from his flowing, and he numbered to him seven days for his cleansing, and he washed his garments and washed his flesh in living water, and was clean.
And in the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, and he came before Jehovah at the door of the tent of appointment, and he gave them to the priest.
And the priest did them, one a sin and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest expiated for him before Jehovah from his flowing.
And a man, when the effusion of seed shall go forth from him, and he washed in water all his flesh, and was unclean till the evening.
And every garment and every akin, which shall be upon it the effusion of seed, and it was washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
And a woman whom a man shall lie with her, with the effusion of seed, and they washed in water, and were unclean till the evening.
And when a woman, shall be flowing, and her flowing shall be blood in her flesh, seven days shall she be in her uncleanness: and all touching upon her shall be unclean till the evening.

And every one touching upon her bed shall wash his garments; and he washed in water and was unclean till the evening.

And if lying down a man shall lie with her and her uncleanness shall be upon him, and he was unclean seven days: and every bed which he shall lie upon, it shall be unclean.
And when a woman shall flow a flowing of her blood many days out of the time of her uncleanness, or when she shall flow upon her uncleanness; all the days of the flowing from her uncleanness shall be as the days of her uncleanness: she shall be unclean.
Every bed which she shall lie upon it all the days of her flowing, shall be to her as the bed of her uncleanness; and every vessel which she shall sit upon it shall be unclean, as the impurity of her uncleanness.
And every one touching upon them shall be unclean, and he washed his garments, and washed in water, and was unclean till the evening.
And if she was cleansed from her flowing, and she numbered to her seven days, and afterward she shall be clean.
And in the eighth day she shall take to her two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove, and she brought them to the priest to the door of the tent of appointment.
And the priest did the one a sin, and the one a burnt-offering; and the priest expiated for her, before Jehovah, from the flowing of her uncleanness.
And ye winnowed the sons of Israel from their uncleanness; and they shall not die in their uncleanness in defiling my dwelling which is in the midst of you.
This the law of him flowing, and of whom the effusion of seed shall go forth from him, to be defiled in it:
And of her being sick in her uncleanness, and of him flowing his flowing; for the male, and for the female, and for the man who shall lie with her being unclean.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, in their bringing near before Jehovah, and they shall die.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, and he shall not come in every time into the holy place within the vail at the face of the cover which is upon the ark; and he shall not die for I will be seen in the cloud upon the cover.
In this shall Aaron come in to the Holy Place, with a bullock, the son of a cow, for sin, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
The holy linen tunic shall be put on, and the linen drawers shall be upon his flesh, and with a linen girdle shall he be girded, and with a linen turban shall he be wound round: these the holy garments; and he washed his flesh in water and put them on.
And from the assembly of the sons of Israel he shall take two he goats of the goats for sin, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
And Aaron brought near the bullock of sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself and for his house.
And he took the two he goats and made them stand before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment.
And Aaron gave lots upon the two he goats; one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for the goat set apart.
And Aaron brought the he goat which upon it came up the lot for Jehovah, and he did it for the sin.
And the he goat which upon it came up the lot for the goat set apart, shall stand living before Jehovah, to expiate upon him, to send him for a goat set apart to the desert.
And Aaron brought near the bullock of the sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself, and for his house, and he slaughtered the bullock of the sin which was to him.
And he took a fire pan full of coals of fire from the altar from before Jehovah, and he filled his hands with incense of aromatics beaten small, and brought within the vail:
And he gave the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of incense covered the vail which was upon the testimonies; and he shall not die.
And he took from the blood of the bullock, and sprinkled with his finger upon the face of the cover eastward, and before the cover he shall sprinkle seven times from the blood with his finger.
And he slaughtered the he goat of the sin which was for the people, and he brought its blood within the vail, and he did its blood as he did to the blood of the bullocks; and he sprinkled it upon the cover and before the cover.
And he expiated for the holy place from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and from their transgression for all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of appointment, dwelling with them in the midst of their uncleanness.
And no man shall be in the tent of appointment in his coming in to expiate in the holy place, till his coming out, he expiated for himself and for his house, and for all the convocation of Israel.
And he went forth to the altar which is before Jehovah and expiated upon it; and he took from the blood of the bullock, and from the blood of the he goat, and gave upon the horns of the altar round about.
And he sprinkled upon it from the blood round about with his finger, seven times, and cleansed it, and consecrated it, from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
And he finished expiating the holy place, and the tent of appointment, and the altar, and he brought the living he goat.
And Aaron placed his two hands upon the head of the living he goat and confessed over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, and gave them upon the head of the he goat, and sent by the hand of a fit man to the desert.
And the he goat lifted up upon him all their iniquities to a desert land: and he sent the he goat into the desert.
And Aaron shall come to the tent of appointment, and he put off the garments of linen which he put on in his going in to the holy place, and he left them there.
And he washed his flesh in water in the holy place, and he put on his garments and came forth, and did his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and expiated for himself, and for the people.

And it was to you for a law forever: in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month ye shall humble your souls, and all work ye shall not do, the native and the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.
For in that day he shall expiate for you, to cleanse you from all your sins: before Jehovah shall ye be clean.
And this is a Sabbath of Sabbath to you, and ye humbled your souls, a law forever.
And the priest expiated whom he shall anoint and whose hand he shall fill, to be priest instead of his father: and he put on the garments of linen of the holy place.
And he expiated the holy of holy, and the tent of appointment, and the altar shall he expiate: and for the priests, and for all the people of the convocation, shall he expiate.
And this was to you for a law forever to expiate for the sons of Israel, from all their sins once in a year: and he will do as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, This the word which Jehovah commanded, saying,
A man, a man from the house of Israel, who shall slaughter an ox or lamb or goat, in the camp, or who shall slaughter without the camp,
And at the door of the tent of appointment brought it not in to bring near an offering to Jehovah before the dwelling of Jehovah, blood shall be reckoned to that man: he shed blood; and that man was cut off from the midst of his people:
So that the sons of Israel shall bring their sacrifices which they sacrificed upon the face of the field, and they brought them to Jehovah at the door of the tent of appointment, to the priest, and they sacrificed them, sacrifices of peace to Jehovah.
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment; and he burnt the fat for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.

And when a man shall sell the house of dwelling in a walled city, its redemption of it shall be till it was completed: a year of days from its selling shall be its redemption.
And if it was not redeemed till the filling up of a complete year, and the house which is in the city, which, if walled, was set forever to him buying it for his generation: it shall not go forth in the jubilee.
And the houses of the villages which to them not being walled round about, shall be reckoned for a field of the land: redemption shall be to it, and it shall go forth in the jubilee.
And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, redemption shall be always to the Levites.
And whoever shall redeem from the Levites, and the selling of the house and the city of his possession went out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites, this their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.
And the field of the area of their cities shall not be sold, for it is a possession to them forever.
And when thy brother shall be poor, and his hand wavering with thee, hold fast to him; a stranger and sojourner to live with thee.
Thou shalt not take from him interest and increase; thou shalt be afraid of thy God; and thy brother to live with thee.
Thy silver thou shalt not give to him upon interest, and upon increase thou shalt not give him thy food.
I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to be to you for God.
And when thy brother shall be poor with thee, and he was sold to thee, thou shalt not serve upon him the service of a servant.
As the hireling, as the sojourner, he shall be with thee; till the year of jubilee he shall serve with thee;
And he shall go forth from thee, he and his sons with him, and turn back to his family, to the possession of his fathers shall he turn back.
For they are my servants whom I brought them out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold from the sale of a servant.
Thou shalt not rule over him with crushing, and thou shalt be afraid of thy God.
And thy servant and thy maid which shall be to thee, from the nations which are round about you, from them ye shall buy servant and maid.
And from the sons of the sojourner sojourning with you, from them shall ye buy, and from their families which are with you, which were born in your land: and they were to you for a possession.
And ye shall possess them for your sons after you to take possession forever; ye shall serve with them: and over your brethren the sons of Israel, ye shall not rule over him, each over his brother with oppression.
And if the hand of a stranger and sojourner with thee shall attain, and thy brother with him be poor, and he sold to the stranger, a sojourner with thee, or to the root of the stranger's family:
After the selling, redemption shall be to him; one from his brethren shall redeem him:
Or his uncle, or his uncle's son shall redeem him, or from the remainder of his flesh from his family, shall redeem him; or his hand attained, and he redeemed himself.
And he reckoned with him buying him, from the year of his being sold to him till the year of the jubilee: and the silver of his selling was according to the number of years, as the days of a hireling, shall it be with him.
If yet a multitude of years, according to them he shall return his redemption from the silver of his sale.
And if a fewness remained to the years till the year of jubilee; and he reckoned to him according to his years, he shall return his redemption.
As the hireling of the year by the year shall he be with him: he shall not rule him by crushing to thine eyes.
And if he shall not be redeemed in these, and he shall go forth in the year of the jubilee, he and his sons with him.
For to me the sons of Israel are servants; they are my servants which I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: I Jehovah your God.
Ye shall not make to yourselves vain things, and carving, and a pillar ye shall not set up to you, and a stone of imagery ye shall not give in your land, to worship upon it: for I Jehovah your God.
Ye shall watch my Sabbaths, and ye shall fear my holy place: I Jehovah.
If ye shall go in my laws and watch my commands, and do them:
And I gave your rains in their times, and the land gave its produce, and the tree of the field shall give its fruit:
And the threshing time to you reached the vintage, and the vintage shall reach the sowing: and ye ate your bread to satisfying, and ye dwelt in confidence upon your land.
And I gave peace in the land and ye lay down and not being terrified: and I caused the evil beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass through in your land.
And ye chased your enemies, and they fell before you to the sword.
And five from you chased a hundred, and a hundred from you chased ten thousand: and your enemies fell before you to the sword.
And I turned to you and I made you fruitful, and I multiplied you, and I set up my covenant with you.
And ye ate of the old, being dry, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new.
And I gave my dwelling in the midst of you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
And I walked in the midst of you, and I was to you for God, and ye shall be to me for a people.
I Jehovah your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from being servants to them, and I will break the rod of your yoke, and I will cause you to go erect.
And if ye will not hear to me, and will not do all these commands;
And if ye shall reject my laws, and if your soul shall abhor my judgments so as not to do all my commands, to your breaking my covenant:
Surely I will do this to you, and I appointed over you terror, consumption, and burning fever, destroying the eyes and consuming the soul: and ye sowed in vain your seed, and your enemies shall eat it.
And I gave my face against you, and ye were slain before your enemies: and they hating you ruled over you, and ye fled and none pursued you.
And if yet these ye will not hear to me, I added to chastise you seven times for your sins.
And I broke the pride of your strength: and I gave your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
And your strength shall be exhausted to no purpose: and your land shall not give its produce, and the tree of the land shall not give its fruit.
And if ye shall go hostile with me, and shall not be willing to hear to me, and I added upon you seven blows for your sins.
And I sent upon you the beast of the field, and it bereaved you of children, and cut off your cattle, and, diminished you, and your ways were laid waste.
And if by these ye will not be admonished by me, and ye went hostile with me;
And I went also hostile with you, and I struck you, also I, seven for your sins.
And I brought upon you the sword to avenge vengeance of the covenant: and ye were gathered into your cities and I sent death in the midst of you, and ye were given into the hand of the enemy.
In my breaking to you the rod of bread, and ten women baked your bread in one oven, and they returned your bread by weight: and ye ate, and ye shall not be satisfied.
And if by this ye shall not hear to me, and ye went hostile with me;
And I went hostile with you in anger; and I chastised you, I also, seven for your sins.
And ye ate the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
And I laid waste your high places, and I cut off your images, and I gave your carcasses upon the carcasses of your blocks, and my soul abhorred you.
And I gave your cities a desert, and I laid waste your holy places, and I will not smell upon the odor of your sweetness.
And I laid the land waste, and your enemies were astonished at it, they dwelling upon it.
And I will scatter you among the nations, and I drew out after you a sword: and your land was a desert, and your cities shall be a desolation.
Then shall the land delight with its Sabbaths, all the days of its desolation, and ye in the land of your enemies: then shall the land rest and delight with its Sabbaths.
All the days of its desolation shall it rest, which it did not rest in your Sabbaths, in your dwelling upon it.
And they remaining of you, and I brought timidity into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the voice of a driven leaf pursued them, and they fled, fleeing the sword; and they fell, and none pursued.
And they faltered each upon his brother, as from before the sword, and none pursued: and there shall be to you no power of standing before your enemies.
And ye were destroyed in the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
And they being left of you, shall pine away in their sin in the land of your enemies, and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, and the transgression which they dealt treacherously against me, and also that they went hostile with me;
I also will go hostile with them, and I brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart shall be humbled, and then they shall be satisfied with their iniquity;
And I remembered my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaak, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
And the land shall be left of them, and shall delight with its Sabbaths in its desolation from them: and they shall be satisfied because of their iniquity, and because they rejected my judgments, and my laws their soul abhorred.
And yet also this in their being in the land of their enemies, I did not reject them, and I did not abhor them, to cut them off, and to break my covenant with them: for I Jehovah their God.
And I remembered for them the covenant of their beginnings, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the nations to be to them for God: I Jehovah.
These the laws, and judgments, and precepts, which Jehovah gave between him, and between the sons of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall separate a vow by thy estimation, the souls for Jehovah.
And thy estimation was the male of the son of twenty years, and even to the son of sixty years; and thy estimation was fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.
And if it is a female, thy estimation was thirty shekels.
And if from the son of five years, and even to the son of twenty years, and thy estimation was, the male, twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels.
And if from the son of a month, and even to the son of five years, and thy estimation was, the male, five shekels of silver, and for the female, thy estimation, three shekels of silver.
And if from the son of sixty years and from above, if a male, thy estimation was fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.
And if he was poor above thy estimation, and he stood before the priest, and the priest estimated him: and according to whose mouth the hand shall attain, the priest estimated him vowing.
And if cattle which they shall make an offering from them to Jehovah, all which he shall give from it to Jehovah shall be holy.
He shall not change it, and he shall not exchange it, good for evil, or evil for good: and if changing, he shall change cattle for cattle, and the beast, it and its exchange shall be holy.
And if any unclean cattle which they shall not bring near from it an offering to Jehovah, and he made the quadruped to stand before the priest.
And the priest estimated it between good and between evil: according to thy valuation, O priest, so shall it be.
And if redeeming, he shall redeem it, and he shall add its fifth upon thy estimation.
And when a man shall consecrate his house holy to Jehovah, and the priest estimated it between good and between evil: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
And if he consecrating shall redeem his house, and he shall add the fifth of the silver of thy estimation upon it, and it was to him.
And if from the field of his possession a man shall consecrate to Jehovah, and thy estimation was according to its seed: the seed of an omer of barley, at fifty shekels of silver.
If from the year of jubilee he shall consecrate his field, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
And if after the jubilee he shall consecrate his field, and the priest reckoned to him the silver upon the month of the years remaining, till the year of the jubilee, and it was taken away from thy estimation.
And if he consecrating it, redeeming, shall redeem the field, and he shall add the fifth of the silver of thy estimation upon it, and it stood to him.
And if he shall not redeem the field, and if he sold the field to another man, it shall be redeemed no more.
And the field in its going forth in the jubilee was holy to Jehovah, as a consecrated field: to the priest shall be its possession.
And if the field of his purchase which is not from the field of his possession he shall consecrate to Jehovah;
And the priest reckoned to him the number of thy estimation till the year of jubilee: and he gave thy estimation in that day, holy to Jehovah.
In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to whom they bought it from him, to him to whom the possession of the land.
And all thy estimation shall be according to the holy shekel: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
But the first-born which shall be first to Jehovah among the cattle, a man shall not consecrate it; if an ox, if a sheep, it is to Jehovah.
And if from unclean cattle, and he redeemed by thy estimation, and he shall add the fifth upon it: and if it shall not be redeemed, and it was sold by thy estimation.
But all consecrated which a man shall consecrate to Jehovah from all which is to him, from man and cattle, and from the field of his possession, shall not be sold and shall not be redeemed: every thing consecrated it is holy of holies to Jehovah.
Every thing consecrated which shall be consecrated from man, shall not be redeemed: dying, it shall die.
And all the tenth of the land from the seed of the land, from the fruit of the tree, is to Jehovah: it is holy to Jehovah.
And if redeeming, a man shall redeem from his tenth, he shall add to its fifth upon it.
And all the tenth of cattle and sheep, all which shall pass through under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah.
He shall not search between good to evil, and he shall not exchange it; and if exchanging, he shall exchange it, and it was, it and its exchange shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

Command the sons of Israel, and they shall send forth from the camp every one leprous, and every one flowing, and every one unclean for the soul:
From male even to female ye shall send them forth, without the camp shall ye send them; and they shall not defile their camp where I dwell in the midst of them.
And the sons of Israel will do so, and they will send them forth without the camp: as Jehovah spake to Moses, so did the sons of Israel.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, A man or woman when they shall do from any sin of man to cover a transgression against Jehovah, and that soul transgressed;
And they confessed their sin which they did, and he returned his transgression with its head, and he added its fifth upon it, and he gave to whom he transgressed against him.
And if not to the man a kinsman to give back the transgression to him, the transgression being given back to Jehovah, to the priest; besides the ram of expiations, it shall be expiated by it for him.
And every offering for all the consecrated things of the sons of Israel which they shall bring to the priest, shall be to him.
And a man his holy things shall be to him; a man who shall give to the priest, it shall be to him.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, A man, a man when his wife shall turn aside, and she covered a transgression against him,
And a man lay with her with emission of seed, and it was hid from the eyes of her husband, and it was covered, and she was defiled, and no witness against her, and she was not taken hold of.
And the spirit of jealousy passed upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and she was defiled: or the spirit of jealousy passed upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and she was not defiled:
And the man brought forth his wife to the priest, and brought her offering for her, the tenth of an ephah of flour of barley; he shall not pour oil upon it, and he shall not give frankincense upon it, for it the gift of jealousy, the gift of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
And the priest brought her near, and made her stand before Jehovah.
And the priest took holy waters in a vessel of earthen, and from the dust which shall be upon the bottom of the dwelling, the priest shall take and he gave into the water.
And the priest made the woman stand before Jehovah, and uncovered the head of the woman, and gave upon her hands the gift of remembrance, this is the gift of jealousy: and in the hand of the priest shall be to him the waters of contradiction, causing the curse.
And the priest bound her by an oath, and said to the woman, If a man lay not with thee, and thou didst not turn aside to be defiled instead of thy husband, be thou unpunished from the water of contradiction, causing the curse.
And if thou didst turn aside instead of thy husband, and if thou wert defiled, and a man gave with thee his bed besides thy husband;
And the priest bound the woman by an oath in these curses, and the priest said to the woman, Jehovah will give thee for a curse, and for an oath in the midst of thy people, in Jehovah's giving thy thigh to fall, and thy belly to go forth.
And the waters causing the curse shall come into thy bowels, and cause thy belly to come forth, and thy thigh to fall. And the woman said, Amen, amen.
And the priest wrote these curses in a book, and he wiped off into the water of contradiction.
And he caused the woman to drink the water of contradiction causing the curse; and the waters causing the curse shall come into her for contradiction.
And the priest took out of the hand of the woman the gift of jealousy, and lifted up the gift before Jehovah and brought it to the altar.
And the priest took with the hand from the gift its remembrance, and burnt upon the altar, and afterward he shall cause the woman to drink the water.
And he caused her to drink the water, and it was if she was defiled and she shall cover the transgression against her husband, and the waters causing the curse came into her for contradiction, and her belly came forth, and her thigh fell, and the woman was for a curse in the midst of her people.
And if the woman was not defiled and she was clean, and she was unpunished, and conceived seed.
This the law of jealousies, when a woman shall turn aside instead of her husband, and she was defiled;
Or a man, when the spirit of jealousy shall pass over upon him, and he was jealous of his wife, and he made the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest did to her all this law.
And the man was clean from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man or woman shall separate to vow a vow, being consecrated, to be separated to Jehovah:

All the days of his consecration, from all which shall be made from the vine, of the wine, from the grape kernels, even to the skin, he shall not eat.

For his father, and for his mother, for his brother and for his sister, he shall not be defiled for them in their dying: for the consecration of his God upon his head.
All the days of his consecration he holy to Jehovah.
And when the dying shall die by him suddenly, in a moment, and the head of his consecration was defiled and he shaved his head in the day of his cleansing, in the seventh day shall he shave it.
And in the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove to the priest, to the door of the tent of appointment:
And the priest did the one for sin, and one for a burnt-offering, and he expiated for him for what he sinned for the soul, and he consecrated his head in that day.
And he consecrated to Jehovah the day of his consecration, and he brought a lamb, the son of a year, for trespass: and the former days shall fall because his consecration was defiled.
And this the law of him consecrated: in the day of filling up the days of his consecration, he shall bring himself to the door of the tent of appointment:
And he brought his offering to Jehovah, one blameless lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and one blameless ewe lamb, the daughter of her year, for the sin, and one blameless ram for peace;
And a basket of unleavened of fine flour cakes mingled with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and their gifts and their libations.
And the priest brought before Jehovah, and did his sin and his burnt-offering.
And the ram he shall do a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, upon the basket of unleavened: and the priest did his gift and his libation.
And he being consecrated, shaved the head of his consecration at the door of the tent of appointment, and took the hair of the head of his consecration, and gave upon the fire which under the sacrifice of peace.
And the priest took the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake from the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and gave upon the hands of him consecrated, after his shaving his consecration.
And the priest lifted them up a lifting up before Jehovah: it holy to the priest upon the breast of the lifting up and upon the leg of the offering: and afterwards, he being consecrated shall drink wine.
This the law of him consecrated who shall vow his offering to Jehovah for his consecration, besides what his hand shall attain: according to his vow which he vowed, so shall he do according to the law of his consecration.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, So shall ye praise the sons of Israel, saying to them,
Jehovah shall praise thee, and watch thee.
Jehovah shall make his face shine upon thee and shall compassionate thee.
Jehovah shall lift up his face to thee, and put peace to thee.
And they put my name upon the sons of Israel and I will praise them.
And it shall be in the day Moses finished to set up the dwelling, and he will anoint it, and he will consecrate it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels, and he will anoint them, and consecrate them.

Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and cleanse them.
And thus thou shalt do to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them the water of sin, and they caused a razor to pass over upon all their flesh, and they washed their garments, and they were cleansed.
And they took a bullock, son of a cow, and his gift fine flour mixed with oil, and a second bullock, son of a cow, thou shalt take for sin.
And bring near the Levites before the tent of appointment: and gather all the assembly of the sons of Israel.
And bring near the Levites before Jehovah: and the sons of Israel placed their hands upon the Levites.
And Aaron lifted up the Levites, a lifting up before Jehovah, from the sons of Israel; and they were to serve the service of Jehovah.
And the Levites shall place their hands upon the head of the bullocks: and they did the one a sin, and the one a burnt-offering to Jehovah, to expiate for the Levites.
And cause the Levites to stand before Aaron and before his sons, and lift them up a lifting up to Jehovah.
And separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel and the Levites were to me.
And after this the Levites shall go in to serve the tent of appointment: and cleanse them, and lift them up a lifting up.
For being given, they were given to me from the midst of the sons of Israel; instead of the first-born cleaving every womb, every one from the sons of Israel, have I taken them to me.
For to me all the first-born among the sons of Israel among man and among cattle: in the day I struck every first-born in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to me.
And I will take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the sons of Israel.
And I will give the Levites, being given to Aaron and to his sons, from the midst of the sons of Israel, to work the works of the sons of Israel in the tent of appointment, and to expiate for the sons of Israel: and there shall not be a blow among the sons of Israel, in the sons of Israel coming to the holy place.

And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
This is that to the Levites: from the son of five and twenty years and above, and he came in to war the warfare in serving the tent of appointment.
And from the son of fifty years, he shall turn back from the warfare of the service, and shall serve no more.

And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year of their coming out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,

And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel to do the passover.
And they will do the passover in the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the desert of Sinai: according to all which Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.
And there shall be men who were unclean by the soul of man, and they will not be able to do the passover in that day: and they came near before Moses and before Aaron, in that day:
And these men will say to him, We are unclean by the soul of man: wherefore shall we be withheld so as not to bring near an offering of Jehovah at his appointment, in the midst of the sons of Israel?
And Moses will say to them, Stand ye, and I will hear what Jehovah will command for you.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, A man, a man when he shall be unclean by the soul, or in a way far off to you or to your generations, and he did the passover to Jehovah.
In the second month, in the fourteenth day, between the evenings they shall do it, upon unleavened and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
They shall not leave from it till morning, and a bone they shall not break in it: according to all the laws of the passover they shall do it.
And the man who is clean, and was not in the way, and failed to do the passover, that soul was cut off from its people; for he brought not the offering of Jehovah at his appointment, that man shall bear his sin.
And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and he did the passover to Jehovah; according to the law of the passover and according to its judgment, so shall he do: one law shall be to you, and to the stranger, and to the native of the land.
And in the day of the raising up the dwelling the cloud covered the dwelling of the tent of testimony: and in the evening it shall be upon the tent as the appearance of fire till morning.
So shall it be always: the cloud shall cover it, and the appearance of fire by night.
And when the cloud went up from the tent, and after this the sons of Israel shall remove: and in the place where the cloud shall dwell there, there shall the sons of Israel encamp.
At the mouth of Jehovah the sons of Israel will remove, and at the mouth of Jehovah they will encamp: all the days which the cloud shall dwell upon the dwelling they shall encamp.
And in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling many days, and the sons of Israel shall watch the watches of Jehovah, and they shall not remove.
And it is, when the cloud shall be days of number upon the dwelling, at the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah they shall remove.
And it is when the cloud shall be from evening to morning, and the cloud went up in the morning, and they shall remove: either day or by night, and the cloud went up and they removed.
Or days, or a month, or days, in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling to dwell upon it, the sons of Israel shall encamp, and they shall not remove; and in its going up they shall remove.
At the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah, they shall remove; the watches of Jehovah they watched, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Make to thyself two trumpets of silver; turned work shalt thou make them: and they were to thee for calling the assembly and for the removing the camp.
And they sounded with them, and they assembled to thee all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment.
And if they shall sound with one, and to thee assembled the chiefs of the heads of the thousands of Israel.
And ye sounded the signal, and the camps encamping eastward, removed.
And ye sounded the signal the second time, and the camps encamping to the south, removed: they shall sound the signal for their removings.
And in the assembly being gathered together, ye shall sound, and shall not sound loud.
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sound with the trumpets; and they were to you for a law forever to your generations.
And when ye shall go out to war in your land against the enemy pressing you, and ye sounded the signal in the trumpets; and ye were remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye were saved from your enemies.
And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointments, and in the heads of your mouths, and ye shall sound with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace; and they were to you for a remembrance before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
And it shall be in the second year, in the second month, in the twentieth of the month, the cloud was taken up from the dwelling of testimony.

And he will say to him, I will not go; but to my land, and to my kindred I will go.

And the people shall be as complainers, and it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah will hear, and his anger will kindle, and the fire of Jehovah will burn among them and will consume in the extremity of the camp.
And the people will cry to Moses and Moses will pray to Jehovah, and the fire will subside.
And he will call the name of that place Taberah, for the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.
And the scraped together which in its midst will long a longing; and the sons of Israel also will turn back and weep, and they will say, Who will feed us with flesh?

And now our soul shall be dried up; not any thing but to the manna our eyes.
And the manna it as the seed of coriander, and its eye as the eye of bdellium.
The people went to and fro, and gathered and ground in the mill, or crushed in the mortar, and boiled in the pot, and made it cakes; and its taste was as the taste of a sweet cake of oil.
And in the descending of the dew upon the camp by night the manna descended upon it.
And Moses will hear the people weeping to their families, each at the door of his tent: and the wrath of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.
And Moses will say to Jehovah, For what hast thou done evil to thy servant? and for what did I not find grace in thine eyes, to put the debt of all this people upon me?
Did I form all this people? did I beget them? for thou wilt say to me, Lift them up into thy bosom, as a nurse will lift up the sucking child upon the land which thou swarest to their fathers.
Whence to me flesh to give to all this people? for they weep upon me, saying, Thou shalt give to us flesh and we shall eat.
I shall not be able to lift up alone all this people, for it is heavy for me.
And if so thou doest to me, killing, kill me now, if I found grace in thine eyes; and I shall not look upon my evil.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the old men of Israel, whom thou knewest that they were old men of the people, and their scribes; and take them to the tent of appointment, and they shall stand there with thee.

And thou shalt say to the people, Be ye consecrated for the morrow, and ye ate flesh: for ye wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall feed us with flesh? for it was good to us in Egypt; and Jehovah gave to you flesh, and ye ate.
Not one day shall ye eat, and not two days, and not five days, and not ten days, and not twenty days;
Even to a month of days, till when it shall come out from your nostrils, and it shall be to you for loathsomeness, because that ye rejected Jehovah who is in the midst of you, and ye shall weep before him, saying, Wherefore came we out of Egypt?

And Moses will say to him, Thou envying for me; and who will give all the people of Jehovah prophets? when Jehovah will give his spirit upon them.
And Moses will take himself into the camp, he and the old men of Israel.
And a spirit removed from Jehovah and it will divide out the quails from the sea, and will cast upon the camp, as the way of a day hither, and the way of a day thither, round about the camp, and as two cubits upon the face of the earth.
And the people will rise up all that day and all the night, and all the day of the morrow, and will gather the quails: the few gathered ten homers; and they will spread for themselves a spreading round about the camp.
And the flesh yet between their teeth, before it shall be withdrawn and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah will smite upon them an exceeding great blow.
And he will call the name of that place, The Graves of Longings, for there they buried the people longing.
From the Graves of Longings the people removed to the enclosures, and they shall be in the enclosures.

And he will say, Hear ye now, my word: If there shall be your prophet of Jehovah, in a vision I will be known to him; in a dream I will speak to him.
Not so my servant Moses; he was faithful in all my house.
Mouth to mouth I will speak to him, and in appearance and not in enigmas; and the portion of Jehovah shall he behold: and wherefore were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against them; and he will go.
And the cloud removed from the tent; and behold, Miriam being leprous as snow: and Aaron will look upon Miriam, and behold, her being leprous.

And see the land what it is, and the people dwelling upon it, whether it is strong or relaxed, whether it is few or many;
And what the land that they dwell in it, whether it is good or evil; and what the cities that they shall dwell in them, whether in camps or in fortifications;
And what the land, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is in it wood or not And be strong, and take from the fruit of the land. And the days, the days of the first-fruits of the grapes.
And they will go up and will search out the land from the desert of Zin even to Rehob, to go to Hameth.
And they will go up by the south and will come to Hebron; and these Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, children of Anak: and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
And they will go up to the valley of Esheol, and will cut off from there a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they will lift upon a rod upon two; and from the pomegranates, and from the figs.
And he called that place the valley of Eshool, on account of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut off from there.
And they will turn back from searching out the land at the end of forty days.
And they will go, and come to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the assembly of the sons of Israel to the desert of Paran to Kadesh, and will give them back word, and all the assembly, and they will shew them the fruit of the land.
And they will recount to him, and will say, We came to the land where thou sentest us, and also it flowed with milk and honey; and this its fruit.
Only that the people are strong dwelling upon the land, and the cities fortified, and very great: and also we saw the children of Anak there.

And they will bring forth slander of the land which they searched it out to the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we passed through upon it, to search it out, is a land consuming those dwelling upon it: and all the people which we saw in the midst of it, men being long.
And there we saw the giants, sons of Anak, from the giants: and we were in our eyes as the locusts, and so were we in their eyes.
And all the assembly will lift up and give their voice; and the people will weep in that night.
And all the children of Israel will murmur against Moses, and against Aaron; and all the assembly will say to them, Would we died in the land of Egypt! or in this desert would that we died!
And wherefore does Jehovah bring us to this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our little ones shall be for a prey. Would it not be good for us to turn back to Egypt?
And they will say, a man to his brother, We will give a head, and turn back to Egypt.
And Moses will fall, and Aaron, upon their faces before all the gathering of the assembly of the sons of Israel.
And Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, from those searching out the land, tare their garments.

If Jehovah delight in us, and he brought us to this land, and he gave it to us; a land which it flowing with milk and honey.
But against Jehovah ye shall not rebel, and ye shall not be afraid of the people of the land; for they our bread: for their shadow removed from them and Jehovah with us; ye shall not be afraid of them.
And all the assembly will say to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah was seen in the tent of appointment to all the sons of Israel.
And Jehovah will say to Moses How long will this people reject me and how long will they not believe in me by all the signs which I did in the midst of them?
I will strike them with death, and I will destroy them, and I will make thee into a great nation, and strong above them.
And Moses will say to Jehovah, And the Egyptians heard, for thou didst bring up with thy strength this people from the midst of them;
And they will say to those dwelling upon this land; they heard that thou Jehovah art in the midst of this people who wert seen eye to eye; thou Jehovah and thy cloud stood over them, and in a pillar of cloud thou goest before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
And didst thou kill this people as one man, and the nations spake who heard thy fame, saying,
Because Jehovah will not be able to bring in this people to the land which he sware to them, he will slay them in the desert.
And now shall the strength of the Lord be great, as thou spakest, saying,
Jehovah, slow to anger and of great kindness, lifting up iniquity and transgression and cleansing, will not cleanse; striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, upon the third, and upon the fourth.
Forgive now the sin of this people according to thy great kindness, and as thou didst lift up to this people, and even till now.
And Jehovah will say, I pardoned according to thy word:
But yet I live, and the glory of Jehovah shall fill all the earth.
For all the men having seen my glory and my signs which I did in Egypt and in the desert, and they will try me this ten times, they heard not to my voice.
If they shall see the land which I sware to their fathers, and all despising me shall not see it.
And my servant Caleb, because another spirit was with him, and he will follow after me, and I brought him into the land which he went there; and his seed shall inherit it.
And the Amalekites and the Canaanites will dwell in the valley. Tomorrow turn ye; they shall remove for you into the desert the way of the sea of sedge.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
How long for this evil assembly, that they are murmuring against me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against me, I heard.
Say to them, I live, says Jehovah, if not as ye spake in mine ears, so will I do to you:
In this desert shall your carcasses fall; and all of you being reviewed according to all your number, from the son of twenty years and above, who murmured against me.
If ye shall come in to the land which I lifted up my hand for you to dwell in it, except Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun.
And your little ones which ye said shall be for a prey, and I brought them in, and they shall know the land which ye rejected.
And you, your carcasses shall fall in this desert.
And your sons shall be fed in the desert forty years, and bear your fornications till your carcasses be finished in the desert.
According to the number of days which ye searched out the land, forty days, a day a year, a day for a year, shall ye your iniquities; forty years, and ye knew my withdrawal.
I Jehovah spake, if not, I will do this to all this evil assembly setting up against me: in this desert shall they be finished, and there shall they die.
And the men whom Moses sent to search out the land, and they will turn back and will murmur against him to all the assembly, to bring forth slander upon the land.

And Moses will speak these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people will mourn greatly.
And they will rise early in the morning, and will go up to the head of the mountain, saying, Behold us, and we will go up to the place which Jehovah said: for we sinned.
And Moses will say, Wherefore this you are passing by the mouth of Jehovah? And it shall not prosper.
Ye shall not go up, for Jehovah is not in the midst of you; and shall ye not be struck before your enemies?
For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye fell by the sword: for ye turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah will not be with you.
And they will act proudly to go up to the head of the mountain: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses departed not out of the midst of the camp.
And Amalek came down, and the Canaanite, he dwelling in the mountain, and he will smite them, and will beat them, even to Hormah.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall come into the land of your dwellings, which I give to you,
And ye did a sacrifice to Jehovah, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice to separate a vow, or in willingness, or in your assemblies, to make an odor of sweetness to Jehovah, from the oxen or from the sheep:
And he bringing near, brought near his offering to Jehovah, a gift of fine flour, the tenth mingled with the fourth of the bin of oil.
And wine for a libation, the fourth of the hin, thou shalt do upon the burnt-offering or to the sacrifice for the one lamb.
Or to the ram thou shalt do a gift of fine flour, two tenths mingled with oil, the third of the hin.
And wine for a libation the third of the hin, thou shalt bring an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
And when thou shalt do the son of a cow, a burnt-offering or sacrifice to separate a vow, or peace to Jehovah:
And he brought upon the son of a cow a gift of fine flour, three tenths mingled with oil, half the bin.
And wine thou shalt bring for a libation, half the hin, a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
Thus shall it be done to the one bullock or to the one ram, or to the sheep with the lambs, or with the goats.
According to the number which ye shall do, so shall ye do to the one according to their number.
Every native shall do thus with these to bring near a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, or whoever in the midst of you for your generations, and he did a sacrifice, an odor of sweetness to Jehovah; as ye shall do, so shall he do.
One law for you of the assembly, and for the stranger sojourning; a law forever to your generations: as ye, so the stranger shall be before Jehovah.
One law and one judgment shall be to you, and to the stranger sojourning with you.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, In your going into the land where I bring you there,
And it was in your eating from the bread of the land, ye shall lift up a lifting up to Jehovah.
The first of your groats, a cake, shall ye lift up a lifting up; as the lifting up of the threshing floor, so shall ye lift it up.
From the first of your groats, shall ye give to Jehovah a lifting up, for your generations.
And when ye shall err, and shall not do all these commands which Jehovah spake to Moses,
All which Jehovah commanded to you by the hand of Moses from the day which Jehovah commanded, and onward to your generations;
And it was if from the eyes of the assembly there was done in error, all the assembly did a bullock, the son of a cow, for a burnt-offering, for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah, and its gift and its libation, according to judgment, and one he goat of the goats for sin.
And the priest expiated for all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and it was forgiven to them; for it is an error; and they brought their offering a sacrifice to Jehovah, and their sin before Jehovah, for their error.
And it was forgiven to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, to all the people in error.
And if one soul shall sin in error, and he brought a she goat the daughter of a goat, for sin.
And the priest expiated for the soul erring, in sinning in error before Jehovah, to expiate for him; and it was forgiven to him.
The native among the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, one law shall be to you, for doing in error.
And the soul which shall do with a high hand, from the native, and from the stranger, it reproaches Jehovah, and that soul was cut off from the midst of its people.
For it despised the word of Jehovah, and broke his command; being cut off, that soul shall be cut off; its iniquity upon it.
And the sons of Israel shall be in the desert, and they shall find a man gathering wood in the day of the Sabbath.
And they having found him, will bring him gathering wood to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the assembly.
And they will put him in watch, for it was not specified what shall be done to him.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Dying, the man shall die: all the assembly stoned him with stones without the camp.
And all the assembly shall bring him forth without the camp, and they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, They made to them fringes of flowers upon the wings of their garment for their generations; and they gave upon the fringes of the wing a thread of cerulean purple;
And it was to you for fringes, and ye saw it, and ye remembered all the commands of Jehovah, and ye did them; and ye shall not seek after your heart, and after your eyes, which ye committed fornication after them.
So that ye shall remember, and ye did all my commands, and ye were holy to your God.
I am Jehovah your God who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to be to you for God; I am Jehovah your God.
And Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, will take, and Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab; and On, son of Peleth, sons of Reuben;
And they will rise up before Moses, and men from the sons of Israel, fifty and two hundred chiefs of the assembly, called by appointment, and men of name:
And they will gather together against Moses, and against Aaron, and they will say to them, Much to you for all the assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah in the midst of them: and wherefore shall be lifted up over the gathering of Jehovah?
And Moses will hear, and will fall upon his face:
And he will speak to Korah and to all his assembly, saying, The morning Jehovah will make known who is to him, and the holy; and bring near to him: and whom he will choose for him he will bring near to himself.
This do ye: take to you censers, Korah and all his assembly:
And ye shall give fire in them and put upon them incense, before Jehovah to-morrow: and it was the man whom Jehovah shall choose, he is holy: much to you, ye sons of Levi.
And Moses will say to Korah, Hear, now, ye sons of Levi:
Is this small for you that the God of Israel separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to him to serve the services of the dwelling of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to serve them?
He will bring thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and did ye seek also the priesthood?
For this thou and all thine assembly being collected together against Jehovah: and Aaron, what is he that ye shall murmur against him?
And Moses will send to call for Dathan and for Abiram, sons of Eliab and they will say, We will not come up.
Is this small that thou broughtest us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, that thou ruling also wilt rule over us?
But not to a land flowing with milk and honey didst thou bring us; and wilt thou give to us the inheritance of field and vineyard? the eyes of these men wilt thou bore out? we will not come up.
And it will be kindled to Moses greatly, and he will say to Jehovah, Thou wilt not turn to their gift: not one ass did I take from them, and I did not evil to one of them.
And Moses will say to Korah, Be thou and all thine assembly before Jehovah, thou and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:
And take each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer and put incense upon them, and bring them near before Jehovah, each his censer, fifty and two hundred censers; and thou and Aaron, each his censer.
And they will take each his censer and will give upon them fire, and will put incense upon them, and they will stand at the door of the tent of appointment, and Moses and Aaron.
And Korah will gather against them all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment; and the glory of Jehovah will be seen to all the assembly.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them as in a moment,
And they shall fall upon their faces, and they will say, God, the God of the spirits for all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry against all the assembly.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to all the assembly, saying, Go up from round about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
And Moses will rise up and go to Dathan and Abiram; and the old men of Israel will go after him.
And he will speak to the assembly, saying, Remove, now, from the tents of these guilty men, and ye shall not touch upon any thing which is to them lest ye shall he destroyed in all their sin.
And they will go up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from round about; and Dathan and Abiram will come forth, standing at the door of their tents, and their wives and their sons and their little ones.
And Moses will say, By this shall ye know that Jehovah sent me to do all these works; for not from my heart.
If according to the death of all men these shall die, if the providence of all men shall be reviewed upon them, Jehovah sent me not.
And if Jehovah shall create a creation, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them and all which is to them, and they went down living to hades; and ye know that these men rejected Jehovah,
And it shall be as he finished to speak all these words, the earth shall cleave asunder which is under them:
And the earth shall open her mouth and shall swallow them and their houses, and all the men which to Korah, and all the possessions.
And they went down, and all which is to them, living, to hades, and the earth shall cover over them; and they shall perish from the midst of the gathering.
And all Israel which were round about them fled at their voice: for they said, Lest the earth shall swallow us.
And a fire will come forth from Jehovah and will consume the fifty and two hundred men bringing the incense.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Say to Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, and he shall take up the censers from the midst of the burning, and scatter the fire afar off; for they were consecrated.
The censers of these sinners against their souls, and they made them beaten plates, a covering for the altar: for they brought them before Jehovah, and they will be consecrated: and they will be for a sign to the sons of Israel.
And Eleazar the priest will take the brazen censers, which they being burnt brought near; and they shall beat them out a covering for the altar,
A remembrance to the sons of Israel, so that a man, a stranger, shall not come near, he who is not from the seed of Aaron, to burn incense before Jehovah; and he shall not be as Korah and as his assembly: as Jehovah spake to him by the hand of Moses.
And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur on the morrow against Moses, and against Aaron, saying, Ye killed the people of Jehovah.
And it shall be in the gathering together of the assembly against Moses and against Aaron, and they shall turn towards the tent of appointment; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah will be seen.
And Moses will go, and Aaron, before the tent of appointment.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Lift up yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them as in a moment. And they will fall upon their faces.
And Moses will say to Aaron, Take a censer and give upon it fire from off the altar, and put incense, and go quickly to the assembly, and expiate for them: for anger went forth from before Jehovah; for it began smiting.
And Aaron will take as Moses spake, and he will run into the midst of the assembly; and behold, it began smiting among the people: and he will give incense and will expiate for the people.
And he will stand between the dead and between the living; and the smiting will be withheld.
And they dying in the smiting will be fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides they dying for the words of Korah.
And Aaron will turn back to Moses to the door of the tent of appointment: and the smiting was withheld.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them a rod, a rod according to the house of the father, from all the chiefs according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: thou shalt write each his name upon his rod.
And Aaron's name shalt thou write upon the rod of Levi: for one rod is for the head of the house of their fathers.
And place them in the tent of appointment before the testimony, where I will pass over to you there.
And it was the man whom I shall desire him, his rod shall be fruitful: and I caused to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against you.
And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel, and all their chiefs will give to him a rod for one chief, a rod for one chief, according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: and Aaron's rod in the midst of their rods.
And Moses will place the rods before Jehovah in the tent of testimony.
And it shall be on the morrow, and Moses will go into the tent of testimony; and behold, Aaron's rod was fruitful for the house of Levi, and the blossom will come forth and the flower will flourish and will show almonds.
And Moses will bring forth all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel: and they shall see and shall take each his rod.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Turn back Aaron's rod before the testimony, for preservation, for a sign for the sons of contradiction; and thou shalt finish their murmurings from me, and they shall not die.
And Moses will do: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
And the sons of Israel will speak to Moses, saying, Behold, we expired, we perished, we all perished.
All coming near, coming near the dwelling of Jehovah, and dying, shall die: shall we die to breathe out life?
And Jehovah will say to Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and thy father's house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the holy place: and thou and thy sons with thee, shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
And also thy brethren, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, and they shall be joined to thee, and they shall serve thee: and thou and thy sons with thee, before the tent of testimony.
And they watched thy watches, and the watches of all the tent: but to the vessels of the holy place, and to the altar they shall not come near, and they shall not die, also they, also ye.
And they were joined to thee, and they watched the watches of the tent of appointment for all the service of the tent: and the stranger shall not come near to you.
And ye watched the watches of the holy place, and the watches of the altar; and anger shall no more be upon the sons of Israel.
And I, behold, I took your brethren the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel: to you being given a gift to Jehovah to serve the services of the tent of appointment.
And thou and thy sons with thee shall watch your priesthood for all the word of the altar, and to within the vail; and ye served: the services a gift I will give your priesthood; and the stranger coming near shall die.
And Jehovah will speak to Aaron, And I, behold, I gave to thee the watches of my offerings for all the holy things of the sons of Israel; to thee I gave them, for the anointing, and to thy sons for a law forever.
This shall be to thee from the holy of holies, from the fire: all their oblations for all their gifts, and for all their sins, and for all their sacrifices, which they shall give back to me, it is holy of holies to thee and to thy sons.
In the holy of holies ye shall eat it; every male shall eat it: holy shall it be to thee.
And this is to thee; the offerings of their gifts for all the liftings up of the sons of Israel: to thee I gave them, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, for a law forever: all clean in thy house shall eat it.
All the fat of the oil, and all the fat of the new wine, and of the grain, their first-fruits which they shall give to Jehovah, to thee I gave them.
The first-fruits, all which are in the land which they shall bring to Jehovah, shall be to thee; all clean in thy house shall eat it.
Every thing consecrated in Israel shall be to thee.
Every thing cleaving the womb for all flesh, which they shall bring to Jehovah, in man or in cattle, shall be to thee: but redeeming, thou shalt redeem the first-born of man, and the firstborn of unclean cattle thou shalt redeem.
And those being redeemed from the son of a month, shalt thou redeem according to thy estimation, the silver of five shekels according to the holy shekel, it is twenty gerahs.
But the first-born of a cow, or the first-born of a sheep, or the first-born of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: their blood shalt thou pour out upon the altar, and their fat thou shalt burn a sacrifice for an odor of sweetness to Jehovah.
And their flesh shall be to thee, as the breast of the lifting up, and as the right shoulder shall be to thee.
All the offerings of the holy things which the sons of Israel shall lift up to Jehovah, I gave to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, for a law forever: it a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah to thee, and to thy seed with thee.
And Jehovah will say to Aaron, In their land thou shalt not inherit, and a portion shall not be to thee in the midst of them. I am thy portion and thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.
And to the sons of Levi, behold, I gave all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance for their services which they served, the service of the tent of appointment.
And the sons of Israel shall no more come near the tent of appointment, to bear sin and to die.
And it is the Levite serving the service of the tent of appointment, and they shall bear their iniquity a law forever to your generations, and in the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance.
For the tenth of the sons of Israel which they shall lift up to Jehovah, an offering I gave to the Levites to inherit: for this I said to them, In the midst of the sons of Israel they shall not inherit an inheritance.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
And to the Levites thou shalt speak and say to them, When ye shall take from the sons of Israel the truth which I gave to you from them for your inheritance, and ye lifted up an offering of Jehovah, a tenth from the tenth.
And your offerings were reckoned to you as the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the filling up from the winepress.
So shall ye also lift up an offering of Jehovah from all your tenths, which ye shall take from the sons of Israel; and ye gave from it the offering of Jehovah to. Aaron the priest.
From all your gifts ye shall lift up all the offerings of Jehovah, from all its fat consecrated from it.
And say to them, In your offering its fat from it, and it was reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing-floor, and as the produce of the wine-press.
And ye ate it in every place, ye and your house; for it is the reward to you for your service in the tent of appointment.
And ye shall not bear sin for it in your lifting up its fat from it: and the holy things of the sons of Israel ye shall not defile, and ye shall not die.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
This is the law of the precept which to Jehovah commanded, saying, Speak the sons of Israel and they shall take to thee a red, blameless heifer, to which not a blemish in her, and which a yoke was not lifted up upon her.
And give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and slaughter her before him.
And Eleazar the priest took from her blood with his finger, and sprinkled before the face of the tent of appointment, from her blood seven times.
And he burnt the heifer before his eyes; her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.
And the priest took cedar wood and hyssop and double scarlet, and cast into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
And the priest washed his garments, and bathed his flesh in water, and afterward he shall go into the camp; and the priest was unclean till evening.
And he burning her shall wash his garments in water, and bathed his flesh in water, and was unclean till the evening.
And a clean man gathered up the ashes of the heifer, and put without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be to the assembly of the sons of Israel for a preservation for a water of uncleanness: it is sin.
And he gathering the ashes of the heifer washed his garments, and was unclean till the evening: and it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, for a law forever.
He touching upon the dead of any soul of man and he was unclean seven days.
He shall purify himself in the third day, and in the seventh day he shall be clean: and if he shall not be purified in the third day, in the seventh day he shall not be clean.
All touching upon the dead, upon the soul of man which shall die, and shall not be purified, defiled the dwelling of Jehovah; and that soul was cut off from Israel: for the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness yet upon him.
This the law of a man when he shall die in the tent; all going into the tent and all who are in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
And every vessel being open which a cord was not bound upon it, it is unclean.
And every one who shall touch upon the face of the field, upon the wounded of the sword, or upon the dead, or upon the bone of man, or upon a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
And they took for the unclean from the dust of the burning of sin, and living water was given upon it into a vessel:
And a clean man took hyssop and dipped in water and sprinkled upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls which were there, and upon him touching upon a bone, or upon the wounded, or upon the the dead, or upon a grave:
And he being clean sprinkled upon the unclean in the third day, and in the seventh day: and he was cleansed in the seventh day, and he washed his garments and bathed in water, and was clean in the evening.
And a man who shall be unclean and shall not be purified, and that soul was cut off from the midst of the gathering, for he defiled the holy place of Jehovah: the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.
And it was to them for a law forever, and he sprinkling the water of uncleanness shall wash his garments; and he touching upon the water of uncleanness shall be unclean till the evening.
And all which the unclean shall touch upon it, shall be unclean; and the soul touching shall be unclean till the evening.
And the sons of Israel will come, all the assembly, to the desert of Zin, in the first month; and the people will dwell in Kadesh; and Miriam will die there and be buried there.
And there was not water for the assembly: and they will gather together against Moses and against Aaron.
And they will contend with Moses, and will speak, saying, Would that we died in the dying of our brethren before Jehovah!
And for what brought ye the gathering of Jehovah into this desert to die there, we and our cattle.
And for what brought ye us up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? Not a place of seed, and figs, and the vine and the pomegranate; and not water to drink.
And Moses will go, and Aaron, from the face of the gathering to the door of the tent of appointment, and they will fall upon their faces: and the glory of Jehovah shall be seen to them.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Take the rod and gather the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes; and it gave water; and brought to them water from the rock, and gave drink to the assembly, and their cattle.
And Moses will take the rod from before Jehovah, as he commanded him.
And Moses and Aaron will gather together the gathering before the rock, and he will say to them, Hear, now, ye rebellious: from this rock shall we bring forth to you water?
And Moses will lift up his hand and will smite the rock with the rod twice, and many waters will come forth, and the assembly will drink and their cattle.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, and to Aaron, Because ye believed not in me, to consecrate me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, for this, ye shall not bring in this gathering to the land which I gave to them.
These the Waters of Strife, because the sons of Israel strove with Jehovah, and he will be consecrated in them.
And Moses will send messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus said thy brother Israel, Thou knewest all the distress which found us:
And our fathers will go down to Egypt and will dwell in Egypt many days; and the Egyptians will do evil to us and to our fathers.
And we shall cry to Jehovah, and he will hear our voice, and he will send a messenger and he will bring us forth out of Egypt: and behold us in Kadesh, a city the end of thy boundary.
Now we will pass over in thy land: we will not pass through in the field and in the vineyard, and we will not drink the water of the well: the way of the king we will go; we will not incline to the right or to the left till we shall pass over thy boundary.
And Edom will say to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest with the sword I shall come out to thy meeting.
And the sons of Israel will say to him, By the highway will we come up; and if we shall drink of thy waters, I and my cattle, I gave a price: only not speaking, I will pass through on my feet.
And he will say, Thou shalt not pass through. And Edom will come forth to his meeting with a heavy people, and with a strong hand.
And Edom will refuse to give to Israel to pass over by his boundary; and Israel will turn away from him.
And they will remove from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, all the assembly will come to Mount Hor.
And Jehovah will say to Moses and to Aaron, in mount Hor, upon the boundary of the land of Edom, saying,
Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not come into the land which I gave to the sons of Israel, because that ye resisted my mouth at the Waters of Strife.
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor.
And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered and die there.
And Moses will do as Jehovah commanded: and he will bring him up to mount Hor before the eyes of all the assembly.
And Moses will strip Aaron of his garments, and will put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron will die there in the head of the mountain: and Moses will come down, and Eleazar, from the mountain.
And all the assembly will see that Aaron died, and they will weep for Aaron thirty days, all the house of Israel.
And the Canaanite, King Arad, dwelling to the south, will hear that Israel came the way of the places, and he will fight against Israel, and he will carry off from him a captivity.
And Israel will vow a vow to Jehovah, and will say, If giving, thou wilt give this people into my hand, and I exterminated their cities.
And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Israel, and he will give the Canaanite, and he will exterminate them and their cities: and he will call the name of the place Hormah.
And they will remove from mount Hor, the way of the sea of sedge, to encompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people will be shortened in the way.
And the people will speak against God, and against Moses, For what brought ye us up from Egypt to die in the desert? for no bread, and no water; and our soul loathed upon this light bread.
And Jehovah will send upon the people deadly serpents, and they will bite the people; and much people will die from Israel.
And the people will come to Moses, and they will say, We sinned, for we spake against Jehovah and against thee; wilt thou pray to Jehovah and he will remove the serpent from us? And Moses will pray for the people.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Make to thee a burning, and put it up for a signal: and it was every one being bitten, and he saw it and lived.
And Moses will make a brass serpent, and will set it up for a signal, and it was if the serpent bit a man and he looked upon the brass serpent, and he lived.
And the sons of Israel will remove, and will encamp in Oboth.
And they will remove from Oboth and will encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the desert which is upon the face of Moab, from the rising of the sun.
From thence they removed, and they will encamp in the valley of Zared.
From thence they removed, and they will encamp from the other side of Amon, which is in the desert coming forth from the boundary of the Amorites: for Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and between the Amorites.
For this it will be said in the book of the wars of Jehovah, Giving in the whirlwind, and the torrents of Arnon.
And the outpouring of the torrents which extended to the rest at Ar, and reclined to the boundary of Moab.
And from thence the well; it is the well of which Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together and I will give to them water.
The Israel will sing this song: Ascend thou well! answer ye to it.
The leaders dug it, the nobles of the people dug it, by cutting in by their props. And from the desert to Mattanah.
And from Mattanah to the Valley of God; and from the Valley of God to Bamoth.
And from Bamoth, the valley which is in the field of Moab, the head of Pisgah, and looking upon the face of Jeshimon.
And Israel will send messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,
I will pass over in thy land: we will not turn into the field and into the vineyard; we will not drink water of the well; in the way of the king we will go till we shall pass over thy boundary.
And Sihon gave not to Israel to pass over by his boundary; and Sihon will gather all his people, and will come forth to meet Israel to the desert: and he will come to Jahaz, and he will fight against Israel.
And Israel will smite him with the mouth of the sword, and he will possess his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon: for the boundary of the sons of Ammon was strong.
And Israel will take all these cities: and Israel will dwell in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her daughters.
For Heshbon this the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites; and he fought against the king of Moab, and he will take all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
For this they will say, using parables, Come ye to Heshbon; the city of Sihon shall be built and prepared.
For a fire shall come forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of Arnon.
Wo to thee, Moab! thou wert destroyed, O people of Chemosh: he gave his sons escaping, and his daughters, into captivity to the king of the Amorites, Sihon.
And we shall shoot them; Heshbon was destroyed, even to Dibon, and the women even to Nophah, which is to Medeba.
And Israel will dwell in the land of the Amorites.
And Moses will send to search Jazer, and they will take her daughters, and will drive out the Amorite who is there.
And they will turn and go up the way of Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, will come forth to their meeting, he and all his people, to the war at Edrei.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Thou shalt not be afraid of him; for into thy hand I gave him, and all his people and his land; and do to him as thou didst to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon.
And they will strike him, and his sons, and all his people, until a survivor was not left to him: and they will possess his land.
And the sons of Israel will remove and will encamp in the deserts of Moab, from the other side of Jordan at Jericho.
And Balak, son of Zippor, will see all that Israel did to the Amorite.
And Moab will be afraid from before the people greatly, for they were many; and Moab will feel disgust from the face of the sons of Israel.
And Moab will say to the old men of Midian, Now this gathering will lick up all round about us, as the ox licking up the green of the field. And Balak, son of Zippor, the king of Moab in that time.
And he will send messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call to him, saying, Behold, a people came forth out of Egypt: behold, it covered the eye of the earth, and it dwelt from before me.
And now, come now, curse to me this people, for he is strong above me: perhaps I shall be able to strike upon him, and drive him out of the land, for I know whom thou shalt praise is praised, and whom thou shalt curse, shall be cursed.
And the old men of Moab and the old men of Midian, will go, and divinations in their hand; and they will come to Balsam, and they will speak to him the words of Balak.
And he will say to them, Remain here this night, and I will turn back word to you according as Jehovah will speak to me: and the leaders of Moab will dwell with Balaam.
And God will come to Balaam, and will say, What men these with thee?
And Balaam will say to God, Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent to me,
Behold, the people came forth out of Egypt, and it will cover the eye of the earth: now come curse him to me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against him and I drove him out.
And God will say to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for he is praised.
And Balaam will rise in the morning and will say to the leaders of Balak, Go to your land: for Jehovah refused to give me to go with you.
And the leaders will rise and go to Balak, and say, Balaam refused to come with us,
And Balak will add yet to send leaders, many and honorable, more than these.
And they will go to Balaam, and say to him, Thus said Balak, son of Zippor, Now thou wilt not withhold from coming to me:
For honoring, I will honor thee greatly, and all which thou shalt say to me I will do; and come, now, curse to me this people.
And Balaam will answer, and say to the servants of Balak, If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass over the mouth of Jehovah my God to do little or great.
And now, sit ye down, now also in here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will add to speak with me.
And God will come to Balaam at night, and say to him, If the men have come to call to thee, rise up, go with them, and only the word which I shall speak to thee, thou shalt do it.
And Balaam will rise up in the morning, and saddle his ass, and go with the leaders of Moab.
And the anger of God will kindle because he went; and the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the way, for an adversary to him: and he rode upon his ass, and his two young men with him.
And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass will turn from the way and go into the field: and Balaam will strike the ass to turn her in the way.
And the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the hollow of the vineyards, an enclosure hence, and an enclosure thence.
And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will press to the wall, and she will press Balaam's foot to the wall; and he will add to strike her,
And the messenger of Jehovah will add to pass by and stand in a narrow place where is no way to turn to the right, and to the left.
And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will lie down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger will kindle, and he will strike the ass With a rod.
And Jehovah will open the mouth of the ass, and she will say to Balaam, What did I to thee that thou hast smitten me this three beats?
And Balaam will say to the ass, Because thou didst vex me: would that a sword was in my hand, for now I had killed thee.
And the ass will say to Balaam, Am not I thine ass which thou didst ride upon me ever since thou wert till this day? and being accustomed, was I accustomed to do to thee thus? And he will say, No.
And Jehovah will uncover the the eyes of Balsam, and he will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he will bow down and worship upon his face.
And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, For what didst thou strike thine ass this three beats? behold, I came forth for an adversary, for the way is perverse before me.
And the ass will see me, and will turn before me this three beats: unless she turned from before me for now also I had slain thee, and preserved her alive.
And Balaam will say to the messenger of Jehovah, I sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest to meet me in the way; and now if evil in thine eyes, I will turn back to me.
And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Balaam, Go with the men: and only the word which I shall speak to thee thou shalt speak it: and Balaam will go with the leaders of Balak.
And Balak will hear that Balsam came, and he will go forth to meet him to a city of Moab, which is by the boundary of Arnon, which is m the end of the boundary.
And Balak will say to Balaam, Sending, did I not send to thee to call to thee? wherefore camest thou not to me? indeed shall I not be able to honor thee?
And Balaam will say to Balak, Behold, I come to thee: being able, shall I be able to speak any thing? the word which Jehovah shall put in my mouth I will speak it.
And Balaam will go with Balak and they will come to Kirjath Huzoth.
And Balak will sacrifice oxen and sheep, and he will send to Balaam and to the leaders which were with him.
And it will be in the morning, and Balak will take Balaam, and will bring him up to the heights of Baal, and he will see from thence the end of the people.
And Balaam will say to Balak, Build to me here seven altars, and prepare to me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
And Balak will do as Balsam spake, and Balak will bring up, and Balaam, a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
And Balsam will say to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to my meeting: and the word which he will shew to me I will announce to thee. And he will go to the naked hill.
And God will meet Balaam, and he will say to him, I arranged seven altars, and I will bring up a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
And Jehovah will put the word in Balaam's mouth, and say, Turn back to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
And he will turn back to him, and behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the leaders of Moab.
And he will take up his parable, and say, From Aram, Balak, king of Moab, will transfer me from the mountains of the east; Come curse to me Jacob and come and be angry at Israel.
How shall I curse, God cursing not? And how shall I be angry, God not being angry?
From the head of the rocks I shall see him, and from the hills I shall look after him: behold, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
Who divided out the dust of Jacob and who numbered the fourth of Israel? My soul shall die the death of the just, and my latter state shall be as his.
And Balak will say to Balaam, What didst thou to me? To curse mine enemies I took thee, and behold, praising, thou didst praise.
And he will answer and say, What Jehovah shall put in my mouth shall I not watch, to speak?
And Balak will say to him, Come now with me to another place, where thou shalt see him from thence: thou shalt see only their extremity, and thou shalt not see them all: and curse him to me from thence.
And he will take him to the field of Zophim, to the head of Pisgah, and he will build seven altars, and bring up a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
And he will say to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, and I will meet there.
And Jehovah will meet Balaam, and he will put the word in his mouth, and say, Turn back to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
And he will come to him, and behold him standing by his burnt-offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak will say to him, What spake Jehovah?
And he will take up his parable, and say, Rise up, Balak, and hear; and give ear to me, son of Zippor:
God is not man, and will he lie? and the son of man, and will he grieve? Did he say, and will he not do? and speak, and will he not establish?
Behold, I was taken to praise: and he praised and I shall not turn it back.
He saw not iniquity in Jacob and he saw not sorrow in Israel: Jehovah his God with him, and the shouts of a king in them.
God bringing them out of Egypt; as the swiftness of the buffalo to him.
For no enchantment in Jacob, and no divination in Israel; according to the time it will be said to Jacob and to Israel, What did God do!
Behold, the people will rise up as a lioness, and as a lion he will be lifted up: he will not lie down till he shall eat the prey and drink the blood of the wounded.
And Balak will say to Balaam, Also, cursing, thou shalt not curse him, also thou shalt not praise him.
And Balsam will answer and say to Balak, Spake I not to thee, saying, All which Jehovah shall speak I will do it?
And Balak will say to Balaam, Come now, I will take thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the eyes of God, and curse him to me from thence.
And Balak will take Balaam to the head of Peor, projecting upon the face of the desert.
And Balsam will say to Balak, Build to me here seven altars, and prepare to me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
And Balak will do as Balaam said, and he will bring up a bullock, and a ram, upon the altar.
And Balaam will see that it was good in the eyes of Jehovah to praise Israel, and he went not now as before to meet enchantments, and he will set his face to the desert.
And Balsam will lift up his eyes and see Israel dwelling according to his tribes; and the spirit of God will be upon him.
And he will take up his parable and say, Balaam, the son of Beor, and the man of unclosed eye, said;
He said, hearing the sayings of God, who will see the vision of the Almighty, falling, and the eyes being uncovered:
How good thy tents, Jacob, and thy dwellings, Israel!
As valleys extended, as a garden by the river, as tents Jehovah pitched, as cedars by the waters.
He will shake out the water from his bucket, and his seed in many waters, and his king shall be lifted up above Agag, and his kingdom shall be raised up.
God brought him forth out of Egypt; as the swiftness of the buffalo to him: he shall cut up the nations his enemies; he shall cut off their strong defenses, and he shall smite through his arrows.
He bowed; he lay down as a lion, and as a lioness: who shall raise him up? Praised he praising thee, and cursed he cursing thee.
And Balak's anger will kindle against Balaam, and he will strike his hands: and Balak will say to Balaam, To curse mine enemies I called thee, and behold, blessing, thou didst bless this three beats.
And now flee for thyself to thy place: I said, Honoring, I will honor thee, and behold, Jehovah withheld thee from honor.
And Balaam will say to Balak, Also to thy messengers which thou sentest to me, spake I not, saying,
If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass by the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or evil from my heart; what Jehovah shall speak I will speak it.
And now, behold me going to my people: come, I will advise thee what this people will do to thy people in the last of the days.
And he will take up his parable, and say, Balaam the son of Beor, said, and the man of unclosed eye, said:
He said, hearing the sayings of God, honoring the knowledge of the Most High, he will see the vision of the Almighty, falling, and the eyes being uncovered:
I shall see him and not now: I shall look after him, and not near: a star came forth from Jacob, and a rod rose up from Israel and dashed in pieces the faces of Moab, and undermined all the sons of Seth.
And Edom was an inheritance, and the inheritance of Seir was his enemies; and Israel did in strength.
And he shall descend from Jacob, and he destroyed the escaped from the city.
And he will see Amalek, and he will take up his parable, and say, Amalek the beginning of the nations, and his latter state he perished forever.
And he will see the Kenite, and he will take up his parable, and say, Strong thy dwelling, and put thy nest in the rock.
For if Cain shall be for consuming, how long shall Assyria take thee captive?
And he will take up his parable, and say, Wo! who shall live, God doing this?
And ships from the hand of the Cyprians, and they afflicted Assyria, and they afflicted Heber, and he also perished forever.
And Balaam will rise up and will go, and turn back to his place; and also Balak went to his way.

A man when he shall vow a vow to Jehovah, or swear an oath to bind a binding upon his soul, he shall not profane his word; according to all going forth from his mouth he shall do.
And a woman when she shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and bind a binding in the house of her father, in her youth;
And her father heard her vow and her binding which she bound upon her soul, and her father was silent to her; and all her vows stood, and all the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
And if her father refused her in the day of his hearing, all her vows and all her bindings which she bound upon her soul, it shall not stand; and Jehovah will forgive her, for her father refused her.
And if being she shall be to a husband, and her vows upon her, or the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul:
And her husband heard in the day of his hearing, and was silent to her: and her vows stood, and the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
And if in the day her husband heard he shall refuse her, and he annulled her vows which were upon her, and the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul, and Jehovah will forgive her.
And the vow of a widow, and of her driven away, all which she bound upon her soul shall stand upon her.
And if in the house of her husband she vowed or bound a binding upon her soul with an oath:
And her husband heard and was silent to her, he refused her not: and all her vows shall stand, and all the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.
And if her husband annulling, shall annul them in the day of his hearing; all the going forth of her lips for her vows and for the binding of her soul, shall not stand: her husband annulled them, and Jehovah will forgive her.
Every vow, and every oath of binding to afflict the soul, her husband shall cause it to stand, and her husband shall annul it.
And if her husband being silent, shall be silent to her from day to day; and he caused to stand all her vows, or, all her bindings which were upon her: he caused them to stand, for he was silent to her in the day of his hearing.
And if annulling, he annulled them after his hearing; and he bore the iniquity.
These the laws which Jehovah commanded Moses between a man to his wife, between a father to his daughter, in her youth in her father's house.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Avenge the avenging of the sons of Israel of the Midianites: afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.
And Moses will speak to the people, saying, Arm from yourselves the men for war, and they shall be against Midian, to give the avenging of Jehovah upon Midian.
A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe, for all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to war.
And there shall be separated from the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

And the sons of Israel will take captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle, and all their possessions, and they plundered all their strength.
And their cities with their dwellings, and all their walls they burnt in fire.
And they will take all the plunder and all the spoil, in man and in cattle.
And they will bring to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the sons of Israel, the captivity and the spoil and the plunder, to the camp to the desert of Moab, which is by Jordan of Jericho.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the chiefs of the assembly will come forth to their meeting without the camp.
And Moses will be angry against the officers of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds coming from the war of the battle.
And Moses will say to them, Preserved ye alive every female?
Behold, they were to the sons of Israel by the word of Balaam for separating treacherously against Jehovah, concerning the word of Peor; and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah.
And now kill every male among the little ones; and every woman know in man by the bed of a male, do ye kill.
And all the little ones among the women who knew not the bed of a male, preserve ye alive for yourselves.
And encamp ye without the camp seven days: every one killing a soul, and every one touching upon the wounded, ye shall be purified in the third day, and in the seventh day, ye and your captivity.
And every garment and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats' hair, and every vessel of wood, ye shall purify.
And Eleazar the priest will say to the men of war coming from the battle, This the law of instruction which Jehovah commanded Moses:
Only the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
Every thing which shall come through fire ye shall make pass through fire, and it was cleansed: only with the water of uncleanness shall it be purified: and all which will not come through the fire ye shall make pass through the water.
And wash ye your garments in the seventh day, and be purified, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Take the head of the spoil of the captivity, in man and in cattle, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the assembly.
And divide the spoil between them taking hold of the battle, going forth to war, and between all the assembly:
And cast a tribute to Jehovah from the men of the battle going forth to war: one soul from five hundred, from the men and from the oxen, and from the asses, and from the sheep:
Ye shall take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, an offering of Jehovah.
And from the sons of Israel's half thou shalt take one taking from fifty, from the men, from the oxen, from the asses, and from the sheep, from all the cattle, and give them to the Levites watching the watches of the dwelling of Jehovah.
And Moses will do, and Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And the remainder of the spoil plundered which the people of war plundered, will be six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
And the oxen two and seventy thousand,
And the asses, one and sixty thousand,
And the souls of man, from the women which knew not the bed of a male all the souls, two and thirty thousand.
And half of the portion of those having gone forth in the war, the Numbers of the sheep will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred.
And the tribute to Jehovah will be from the sheep, six hundred five and seventy.
And the oxen, six and thirty thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and seventy.
And the asses thirty thousand and five hundred; and their tribute to Jehovah, one and sixty.
And the souls of man, sixteen thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and thirty souls.
And Moses will give the tribute, an offering of Jehovah, to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And from the sons of Israel's half which Moses divided from the men having warred,
(And the assembly's half from the sheep, will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand five hundred,
And the oxen, six and thirty thousand,
And the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,
And the souls of man, sixteen thousand;)
Moses will take from the sons of Israel's half, one taking from fifty, from man and from cattle, and he will give them to the Levites watching the watches of the tent of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
And there will come near to Moses the officers which are over the thousands of the war, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds:
And they will say to Moses, Thy servants took the head of the men of the battle which are in our hand, and a man was not missed from us.
And we will bring an offering to Jehovah, what each found, vessels of gold, armbands, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and globules of gold, to expiate for our souls before Jehovah.
And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, all the gold from them, all the vessels of work.
And all the gold of the offering which they lifted up to Jehovah, will be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds.
The men of war plundered each for himself.
And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and they will bring it to the tent of appointment, a remembrance for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.
And much cattle was to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad exceedingly strong: and they will see the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place a place of cattle.
And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will come and will say to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the chiefs of the assembly, saying,
Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
The land which Jehovah smote before the assembly of Israel, it is a land of cattle, and to thy servants are cattle.
And they will say, If we found grace in thine eyes, will this land be given to thy servants for a possession; ye will not cause us to pass over Jordan.
And Moses will say to the sons of Gad And to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brethren go forth to battle, and will ye sit here?
And wherefore will ye hinder the heart of the sons of Israel from passing over to the land which Jehovah gave to them?
So did your fathers in my sending them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the land.
And they will go up to the valley of Eshcol, and will see the land, and hinder the heart of the sons of Israel not to go to the land which Jehovah gave to them.
And Jehovah's anger will kindle in that day, and he will swear, saying,
If the men coming up out of Egypt, from the son of twenty years and above, shall see the land which I sware to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob; for they filled not up after me:
Except Caleb, son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun: for they filled up after Jehovah.
And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will cause them to wander in the desert forty years, till the finishing of all the generation having done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And behold, ye rise up instead of your fathers, a growth of men sinners, to add yet to the burning anger of Jehovah to Israel.
When ye shall turn back from after him, and he will add yet to leave him in the desert; and ye will destroy all this people.
And they will draw near to him, and say, Sheep-folds will we build for our cattle here, and cities for our little ones.
And we will arm ourselves, basting on before the sons of Israel, till we brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
We will not turn back to our houses till the sons of Israel inherit each his inheritance.
For we will not inherit with them from the other side of Jordan and forward; for our inheritance has come to us from this side of Jordan from the risings.
And Moses will say to them, If ye will do this word, if ye will arm yourselves before Jehovah for battle,
And all to you being armed, pass over Jordan before Jehovah, till his driving out his enemies from his face,
And the land subdued before Jehovah: and afterwards ye shall turn back, and be unpunished from Jehovah and from Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Jehovah.
And if ye shall not do this, behold, ye sinned to Jehovah: and know ye, your sin which shall find you.
Build to you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and ye shall do that coming out of your mouth.

And if they will not pass over armed with you, and they possessed in the midst of you in the land of Canaan.

Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye are passing over Jordan to the land of Canaan,
And have driven out all those dwelling in the land from before you, and destroy ye all their watch towers, and all their molten images ye shall destroy, and all their heights ye shall lay waste:
And dispossess ye the land and dwell in it, for to you, I gave the land to possess it.
And divide ye the land by lot to your tribes: to the many ye shall multiply his inheritance, and to the few ye shall diminish his inheritance; to whom shall come forth to him, there shall the lot be to him; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
And if ye shall not drive out those dwelling in the land from before you, and it shall be whom ye shall leave from them for thorns in your eyes, and for prickles in your sides; and they pressed you upon the land which ye shall dwell upon it.
And it was as I purposed to do to them I will do to you.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Command the sons of Israel, and say to them, When ye coming into the land of Canaan (this the land which shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan with her bounds),
And to you was the south side from the desert of Zin upon the hands of Edom, and to you was the south boundary from the extremity of the salt sea eastward.
And to you turned the boundary from the south to the ascending of Akrabbim, and it passed over Zin: and its going forth was from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it went forth to the Enclosure of the Threshing Floor, and it passed over to Azmon:
And the boundary turned from Azmon to the torrent of Egypt, and the goings out were the sea.
And the boundary of the sea, and it was to you the great sea; and this shall be the boundary to you, the boundary of the sea.
And this shall be to you the north boundary: from the great sea ye shall mark out to you mount Hor.
From mount Hor ye shall mark out to you to the going in of Hamath: and the goings out were to Zedad.
And the boundary went forth to Ziphron, and the goings out were the Enclosure of Enan: this shall be to you the north boundary.
And mark out to you to the east boundary, from the Enclosure of Enan to Shepham.
And the boundary went down from Shepham to Riblah, from the east to Ain; and the boundary went down and it struck upon the shoulder of the son of Chinnereth eastward.
And the boundary went down to Jordan, and its goings out were to the salt sea. This shall be to you the land according to the boundaries round about.
And Moses will command the sons of Israel, saying, This the land which ye shall inherit it by lot, which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.
For the tribe of the sons of Reuben took according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad according to the house of their fathers, and the half tribe of Manasseh took their inheritance.
The two tribes and the half tribe took their inheritance from the other side to Jordan of Jericho eastward from the rising.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
These the names of the men which shall cause you to inherit the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
And one chief, one chief shall ye take from a tribe to cause to inherit the land.

And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Moab by Jordan of Jericho, saying,
Command the sons of Israel, and they gave to the Levites from the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and areas to the cities round about them shall ye give to the Levites.
And the cities were to them to dwell in; and their areas shall be for their cattle, and for their horses, and for all their beasts.
And the areas of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites from the wall of the city and without, a thousand cubits round about.
And ye measured from without the city the east side two thousand cubits, and the south side two thousand by the cubit, and the side of the sea two thousand by the cubit, and the north side two thousand by the cubit; and the city in the midst: this shall be to them the areas of the cities.
And the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, six cities of refuge, which ye shall give to flee there to the slayer: and upon them ye shall give forty and two.
All the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, forty and eight cities: them and their areas.
And the cities which ye shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel: from the many ye shall multiply; and from the few ye shall diminish: each according to his inheritance which they shall inherit, he shall give from his cities to the Levites.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,
Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye are passing over Jordan to the land of Canaan,
And build ye to you cities; cities of refuge shall they be to you; and the slayer to flee there smiting a soul in error.
And they to you the cities for refuge from the nearest relative; and the slayer shall not die till his standing before the assembly for judgment,
And the cities which ye shall give, six cities of refuge shall be to you.
Three cities shall ye give from beyond Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of refuge shall they be.
For the sons of Israel and for the stranger, and for the sojourner in the midst of you shall be six cities: these for refuge to flee there all smiting a soul in error.
And if with an instrument of iron he smote him, the slayer shall die; the slayer he dying, shall die.
And if with a stone of the hand which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.
Or with an instrument of wood of the hand, which he shall die by it he smote him, he the slayer shall die; dying, the slayer shall die.
The nearest relative of blood he shall kill the slayer: in his meeting him he shall kill him.
And if in hatred he thrust at him, or cast upon him, or in lying in wait, he shall die.
Or in enmity he smote with his hand, and he will die; dying, he smiting shall die; he is a slayer: the nearest relative of blood shall kill the slayer in his meeting him.
And if suddenly, not in enmity, he thrust him, or cast upon him any instrument in not lying in wait,
Or with any stone which he shall die by it in not seeing, and it will fall upon him and he shall die, and he not an enemy to him and not seeking his hurt:
And the assembly judged between him smiting, and between the nearest relation of blood according to these judgments:
And the assembly delivered the slayer out of the hand of the nearest relation of blood, and the assembly turned him back to the city of his refuge where he fled there: and he dwelt in it till the death of the great priest who anointed him with the holy oil.
And if going out the slayer shall go out of the boundary of the city of his refuge where he shall flee there;
And the nearest relation of blood finding him without the boundary of the city of his refuge, and the nearest relation of blood slew the slayer; no blood to him.
For in the city of his refuge he shall dwell till the death of the great priest; and after the death of the great priest the slayer shall turn back to the land of his possession.
And these were to you for laws of judgment to your generations in all your dwellings.
Every one striking a soul by the mouth of witnesses, he shall slay the slayer: and one witness shall not testify against a soul to die.
Ye shall not take expiation for the soul of a slayer, he who was guilty to die, for dying, he shall die.
And ye shall not take expiation for him fleeing to the city of his refuge, for turning back to dwell in the land till the death of the priest.
And ye shall not pollute the land which ye are in it: for blood it will pollute the land: and for the land it will not be expiated for the blood which was poured out upon it but by the blood of him shedding.
And thou shalt not defile the land which ye shall dwell upon it, which I dwell in the midst of it: for I Jehovah dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel.
And there will come near the heads of the fathers to the families of the sons of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the families of the sons of Joseph; and they will speak before Moses and before the chiefs of the heads of the fathers to the sons of Israel.
And they will say, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
And they were for wives to one of the sons of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and their inheritance being taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and was added upon the tribe which they shall be to them: and it shall be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.
And when the jubilee shall be to the sons of Israel, and their inheritance was added to the inheritance of the tribe which they shall be to them: and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers their inheritance shall be taken away.
And Moses will command the sons of Israel by the mouth of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph are speaking well.
This the word which Jehovah commanded to the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, To the good in their eyes they shall be for wives; only to the families of the tribe of their fathers shall they be for wives.
And the inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not remove from tribe to tribe; for the sons of Israel shall cleave each to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
And every daughter possessing an inheritance from the tribe of the sons of Israel, to one of the families of the tribe of her father shall she be for wife, so that the sons of Israel shall possess each the inheritance of his fathers.
And the inheritance shall not remove from a tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave each to his inheritance.
As Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
For Mahlah, Tirzah and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, shall be to the sons of their uncles for wives.
To some of the families of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph, they were for wives, and their inheritance shall be to the tribe of the families of their fathers.
These the commands and the judgments which Jehovah commanded by the hand of Moses to the sons of Israel in the desert of Moab by Jordan of Jericho.
These the words which Moses spake to all Israel on the other side Jordan in the desert, in the sterile region over against the sedge between Paran and between Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab.
Eleven days from Horeb the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea.
And it shall be in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, in one to the Month, Moses spake to the sons of Israel according to all which Jehovah commanded him to them.
After his smiting Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan, who will dwell in Ashtaroth in Edrei:
In the other side Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses was first to declare this law, saying,
Jehovah our God spake to us in Horeb, saying, It was enough to you to dwell in this mount:
Turn ye and remove for yourselves, and go to the mountain of the Amorite, and to all his neighbors in the sterile region, in the mountain, and in the low country, and in the south and in the coast of the sea, the land of the Canaanites and of Lebanon to the great river, the river Phrath.
See, I gave the land before you: go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers, to Abraham to Isaak and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
And I spake to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able alone to bear you:
Jehovah your God multiplied you, and behold, you this day as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
Jehovah the God of your fathers will add to you as ye a thousand times, and he will bless you as he spake to you.
How shall I bear alone your burden and your lifting up and your strife.
Give to yourselves men wise and known to your tribes, and I will set them for your heads.
And ye will answer me and say, Good the word which thou spakest to do.
And I will take the heads of your tribes, men wise and known, and I will give them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains and hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and scribes for your tribes.
And I shall command your judges in that time, saying, Hear between your brethren, and judge justice between a man and between his brother and between his stranger.
Ye shall not look upon faces in judgment; as the small so the great shall ye hear; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is to God; and the word which shall be hard for you, ye shall bring to me and I heard it.
And I will command you in that time all the words which ye shall do.
And we shall remove from Horeb and we shall go all that great and fearful desert which ye saw, the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as Jehovah our God commanded us; and we shall come to Kadesh-Barnea.
And I said to you, Ye came to the mountain of the Amorite which Jehovah our God gave to us.
See, Jehovah thy God gave the land before thee: go up, possess, as Jehovah the God of thy fathers spake to thee; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be pressed down.
And ye shall come near to me all of you, and ye will say, We will send men before us, and they shall search out for us the land, and shall turn us back word the way which we shall go up into it, and the cities which we shall come into them.
And the word will be good in mine eyes: and I will take from you twelve men, one man to a tribe.
And they will turn and go up to the mountain, and they will come to the valley of Eshcol, and will search it out.
And they will take in their hand from the fruit of the land, and they will come down to us and will turn us back word, and will say, A good land which Jehovah our God gave to us.
And ye were not willing to go up, and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah your God,
And ye will murmur in your tents, and say, In Jehovah's hating us he brought us out of the land of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us.
Whither are we going up? our brethren melted our heart, saying, A people great and high above us; cities great and fortified to the heavens; and also, the sons of the Anakims, we saw there.
And I said to you, Ye shall not be terrified, and ye shall not be afraid of them.
Jehovah your God went before you; he will fight for you according to all that he did to you in Egypt before your eyes.
And in the desert where thou sawest that Jehovah thy God lifted thee up, as a man will lift up his son, in all the way that ye went till your coming to this place.
And in this word ye are not believing in Jehovah your God.
He going in the way before you to search out for you a place for you to encamp, in fire by night, to cause you to see in what way ye shall go in it, and in a cloud by day.
And Jehovah will hear the voice of your words, and he will be angry, and he will swear, saying,
If a man among these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I sware to give to your fathers,
Except Caleb, son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him I will give the land which he trod upon it, and to his sons, because that he filled up after Jehovah.
Also with me was Jehovah angry on account of you, saying, Also thou shalt not come in there.
Joshua son of Nun, standing before thee, he shall come in there: strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
And your little ones which ye said shall be for a spoil, and your sons which knew not that day good and evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
And you, turn for yourselves and remove to the desert the way of the sea of sedge.
And ye will answer and say to me, We sinned against Jehovah, we will go up and fight according to all that Jehovah our God commanded us. And ye will gird on each the weapon of his fighting, and ye will act lightly to go up to the mountain.
And Jehovah will say to me, Say to them, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not fight; for I am not in the midst of you and ye shall not be smitten before your enemies.
And I shall speak to you, and ye heard not; and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and ye will act proudly, and will go up to the mountain.
And the Amorite dwelling in that mountain will come forth to your meeting, and will pursue you as bees will do, and they will beat you in Seir to Hormah.
And ye will turn back and will weep before Jehovah; and Jehovah heard not to your voice and gave not ear to you.
And ye shall dwell in Kadesh many days according to the days that ye dwelt.
And turning and removing to the desert the way of the sea of sedge, as Jehovah spake to me: and encompassing mount Seir many days.
And Jehovah will speak to me, saying,
It was enough to you to encompass this mount; turn for yourselves to the north,
And command the people, saying, Ye are passing over through the bound of your brethren the sons of Esau, dwelling in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: and ye shall watch greatly.
Ye shall not contend with them, for I will not give to you from their land even to the treading of the sole of the foot, for I gave mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
Ye shall buy food from them for silver, and ye ate: and also shall ye buy water from them for silver, and ye drank.
For Jehovah thy God blessed thee in every work of thy hand: he knew thy going in this great desert: this forty years Jehovah thy God with thee; thou didst not lack a word.
And we shall pass by our brethren the sons of Esau, dwelling in Seir, from the way of the sterile region from Elath, and from Ezion-Gaber, we shall turn and shall pass over the way of the desert of Moab.
And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not press Moab, and thou shalt not contend with them in war; for I shall not give to thee his land a possession, for to the sons of Lot I gave Ar a possession.
(The Emims dwelt in it before them, a people great and many and high as the Anakims;
And they will be reckoned Rephaims also, as the Anakims; and the Moabites will call them Emims.
And the Horims dwelt in Seir before them, and the sons of Esau will inherit them, and they will destroy them from before them, and they will dwell instead of them; as Israel did to the land of his possession which Jehovah gave to them.)
Now rise up and pass over for yourselves the valley Zered; and we shall pass through the torrent Zered.
And the days which we came from Kadesh-Barnea till we passed over the valley Zered, thirty and eight years; till all the generation of men of war was finished from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah sware to them.
For also the hand of Jehovah was against them to finish them from the midst of the camp, till their finishing.
And it will be as when all the men of war were finished to die from the midst of the people,
And Jehovah will speak to me, saying,
Pass thou over this day Ar, the boundary of Moab:
And thou camest near over against the sons of Ammon, thou shalt not press them, and thou shalt not contend with them: for I will not give from the land of the sons of Ammon to thee a possession; for to the sons of Lot I gave it a possession.
It also shall be reckoned the land of the Rephaims; the Rephaims dwelt in it before them, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummims;
A people great and many, and high as the Anakims; and Jehovah will destroy them from before their face; and they will inherit them and will dwell instead of them:
As he did to the sons of Esau dwelling in Seir when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they will inherit them and will dwell instead of them, even to this day:
And the Avims dwelling in the enclosures, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, coming forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and they dwelt instead of them.
Rise ye up, remove and pass through the torrent Arnon: see, I gave into thy hand Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin and possess and thou shalt contend with him in war.
This day I will begin to give thy fear and thy terror upon the face of the peoples under all the heavens who shall hear thy report; and they trembled and were concerned from thy face.
And I will send messengers out of the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
I will pass over in thy land; in the way, in the way I will go, I will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
Thou shalt sell me food for silver, and I ate; and thou shalt give to me water for silver, and I drank: only I will pass through on my feet;
(As the sons of Esau did to me dwelling in Seir, and the Moabites dwelling in Ar,) till when I shall pass over Jordan to the land which Jehovah our God gave to us.
And Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass by him, for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart strong in order to give him into thy hand as this day.
And Jehovah will say to me, See, I began to give before thee Sihon and his land: begin and possess to inherit his land.
And Sihon came forth to our meeting, he and all his people to war at Jahaz.
Jehovah our God will give him before us; and he smote him and his sons and all his people.
And we shall take all his cities in that time, and we shall exterminate every city of men and women and the little ones; we left none to escape.
Only the cattle we plundered for ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
From Aroer which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and the city which is by the torrent, and even to Gilead, not a city which was high above us: Jehovah our God gave all before us.
Only to the land of the sons of Ammon thou camest not near, all the land of the torrent Jabbok and the cities of the mountain: all which Jehovah our God commanded us.
And we shall turn and go up the way of Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, will come forth to our meeting, he and all his people to war at Edrei.
And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not fear him, for into thy hand I gave him and all his people, and his land; and do to him as thou didst to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Hebron.
And Jehovah our God will give into our hand also Og, king of Bashan, and all his people: and we shall smite him till none remained to him escaping.
And we shall take all his cities in that time, and there was not a city which we took not from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, from the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
All these cities fortified with high walls, doors and bars; besides of cities of the open country exceedingly many.
And we shall exterminate them as we did to Sihon, king of Heshbon, exterminating men, women, and little ones.
And all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we plundered for ourselves.
And we shall take in that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, which is on the other side Jordan from the torrent Arnon, even to mount Hermon.
(The Sidonians will call to Hermon, Sirion; and the Amorites will call to it, Shenk.)
All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, even to Salchah and Edrei, cities from the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
For only Og, king of Bashan, remained from the remnant of the Rephaims; behold, his bed, a bed of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits its length and four cubits its breadth, according to the cubit of a man.
And this land we possessed in that time from Aroer which is by the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Gilead and its cities I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gates.
And the remnant of Gilead and all Bashan from the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob and all Bashan, it will be called the land of Rephaims.
Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob, even to the boundary of Geshuri and Maachathi; and he call them according to his name, Bashan-Havath-Jair, even to this day.
And to Machir I gave Gilead.
And to the Reubemtes and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the torrent Anion, the midst of the torrent and the boundary and even to the emptying of the torrent, the boundary of the sons of Ammon.
And the sterile region, and Jordan, and the boundary from Chinnereth, and even to the sea of the desert, the salt sea under the ravines of Pisgah from the sunrising.
And I shall command you in that time, saying, Jehovah your God gave to you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren, the sons of Israel, all sons of strength.
Only your wives and your little ones and your cattle (I knew that much cattle to you) they shall dwell in your cities which I gave to you,
Till when Jehovah shall cause your brethren to rest as you, and they also shall possess the land which Jehovah, your God, gave to them on the other side of Jordan: and ye turned back each to his possession which I gave to you.
And I commanded Joshua in that time, saying, Thine eyes saw all that Jehovah, your God, did to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms which ye pass through there.
Ye shall not be afraid of them, for Jehovah, your God, he shall fight for you.
And I shall entreat Jehovah in that time, saying,
O Lord Jehovah, thou didst begin to cause thy servant to see thy greatness and thy strong hand: for what God in the heavens and in the earth will do according to thy works and according to thy strength?
Shall I now pass over and see the good land which is beyond Jordan, this good mountain, and Lebanon?
And Jehovah will pass by me on account of you, and he heard not to me: and Jehovah said to me, It was enough to thee; thou shalt not add to speak more to me concerning this word.
Go up to the head of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes to the sea, and to the north, and to the south, and to the sunrising, and see with thine eyes; for thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.
And command Joshua and strengthen him, and make him firm, for he shall pass through before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
And we shall dwell in the valley over against the House of Opening.
And now Israel, hear to the laws and to the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye shall live and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers gave to you.
Ye shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, and ye shall not take away from it, to watch the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.
Your eyes saw what Jehovah did upon Baal-Peor: for every man who went after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God destroyed him from the midst of you.
And ye cleaving to Jehovah your God, are living all of you this day.
See, I taught you laws and judgments as Jehovah my God commanded me, to do thus in the midst of the land where ye are going there to possess it.
And watch and do: for it is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples who shall hear all these laws, and say, Only this great nation a wise and understanding people.
For what great nation to whom God being near to it as Jehovah our God in all our calling to him?
And what great nation to whom laws and judgments just, as all the instructions which I give before you this day?
Only watch to thyself and watch thy soul greatly, lest thou shalt forget the words which thine eyes saw, and lest they shall remove from thy heart all the days of thy life: and make them known to thy sons and to the sons of thy sons.
The day thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in Jehovah saying to me, Gather to me the people and I will cause them to hear my word, that they shall be taught to fear me all the days which they live upon the land; and they shall teach their sons.
And ye shall come near and shall stand under the mountain; and the mountain burnt with fire even to the heart of the heavens, darkness, cloud, and gloom.
And Jehovah will speak to you from the midst of the fire, ye hearing a voice of words, and ye seeing not an appearance, except a voice.
And he will announce to you his covenant which he commanded you to do, the ten words; and he will write them upon two tables of stones.
And Jehovah commanded me in that time to teach you laws and judgments for you to do them in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it.
And watch ye greatly to your souls, for ye saw not any appearance in the day Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:
Lest ye shall be corrupted and make to you a carved thing, the appearance of any likeness, the model of male or female,
The model of any cattle that is upon the earth, the model of any winged bird that shall fly in the heavens,
The model of any thing creeping upon the earth, the model of any fish that is in the waters from under the earth:
And lest thou shalt lift up thine eyes to the heavens, and seeing the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of the heavens, and thou wert driven and didst worship to them, and didst serve them, which Jehovah thy God divided them out to all the peoples under all the heavens.
And Jehovah took you and brought you forth out of the furnace of iron, out of Egypt, to be to him for a people of inheritance as this day.
And Jehovah will be angry with me on account of your words, and he will swear for me not to pass through Jordan, and not to go in to the good land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance:
For I die in this land, not to pass over Jordan: and ye are passing over and shall possess this good land.
Watch for yourselves lest ye shall forget the covenant of Jehovah your God which he cut out with you, and ye make to you any carved thing, the appearance of any thing which Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
For Jehovah thy God he is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
When thou shalt beget sons, and sons' sons, and ye rested in the land and were corrupted, and made a carved thing, the appearance of any thing, and ye did evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to irritate him.
I took the heavens and the earth to witness against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish to-morrow from the land which ye are passing over Jordan there to possess it: ye shall not prolong the days upon it, but being destroyed, ye shall be destroyed.
And Jehovah scattered you among the peoples, and ye remained men of number among the nations where Jehovah will lead you there.
And ye served there gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which shall not see, and shall not hear, and shall not eat, and shall not breathe.
And thou sought from thence Jehovah thy God, and thou didst find, for ye shall seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
In straitness to thee, and all these words found thee in the last of the days, and thou didst turn to Jehovah thy God and heardest to his voice;
For Jehovah thy God a merciful God; he will not desert thee, and he will not destroy thee, and he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware to them.
For ask now to the former days which were before thee from the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the end of the heavens to the end of the heavens, Has there been as this great word, or was heard like it?
Did people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire as thou didst hear, and shall live?
Or did God try to go and take to him a nation from the midst of a nation by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand and by an extended arm, and by great fears, according to all that Jehovah your God did to you in Egypt before your eyes?
Thou sawest to know that Jehovah he is God: no more beside him.
Out of the heavens he caused thee to hear his voice to instruct thee: and upon earth he caused thee to see his great fire, and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire.
And because that he loved thy fathers he will choose in his seed after him, and he will bring thee out before him with his great strength from Egypt.
To drive out nations great and strong above thee, from thy face, to bring thee in to give to thee their land an inheritance as this day.
And know thou this day, and turn back to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in the heavens from above and upon the earth underneath: and none yet.
And watch thou his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee this day, that it shall be good to thee and to thy sons after thee, and that thou shalt prolong the days upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee, all the days.
Then Moses will separate three cities in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;
For the slayer to flee there when he shall slay his friend without knowledge; and he hated him not yesterday the third day; and he fled to one of these cities and he lived:
Bezer in the desert, in the land of the plain to the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, to the Manassites.
And this the instruction which Moses set before the sons of Israel.
These the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Moses spake to the sons of Israel in their going forth out of Egypt,
In the other side of Jordan, in the valley over against the House of Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, and the sons of Israel, in their going out of Egypt.
And they shall possess their land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;
From Aroer, which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and even to mount Sion (it is Hermon.)
And all the desert the other side of Jordan, from the sun-rising and even to the sea, the desert under the springs of Pisgah.
And Moses will call to all Israel, and say, Hear, thou Israel, the laws and the judgments which I speak in your ears this day, and learn them, and watch to do them.
Jehovah our God cut out with us a covenant in Horeb.
Jehovah cut not out this covenant with our fathers, but with us, we, these here this day, all we living.
Face to face Jehovah spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire.
(I stood between Jehovah and between you in that time to announce to you the word of Jehovah: for ye were afraid on account of the fire and ye went not up into the mount,) saying,
I Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of servants.
There shall not be to thee other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thee a carved thing, any appearance that is in the heavens from above, and which is in the earth underneath, and that is in the waters under the earth:
Thou shalt not worship to them, and thou shalt not serve them; for I Jehovah thy God, a jealous God, striking the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and the fourth for hating me,
And doing mercy to thousands for loving me and for watching my commands.
Thou shalt not lift up the name of Jehovah thy God for evil, for Jehovah will not acquit whoever shall lift up his name for evil.
Watch the day of the Sabbath to consecrate it, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee.
Six days thou shalt work and do all thy work,
And the seventh day, the Sabbath to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and thy stranger who is in thy gates; so that thy servant and thy maid shall rest like thyself.
And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God brought thee out from there by a strong hand and by an extended arm: for this, Jehovah thy God commanded thee to do the day of the Sabbath.
Honor thy father and thy mother, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee, so that thy days shall be prolonged and so that it shall be good to thee upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee,
Thou shalt not kill,
and thou shalt not commit adultery,
and thou shalt not steal.
And thou shalt not speak false testimony against thy friend:
and thou shalt not desire thy friend's wife; and thou shalt not long for thy friend's house, his field, and his servant, and his maid, his ox and his ass, and all that is to thy friend.
These words Jehovah spake to all your gathering in the mount, from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the gloom, a great voice; and he added not: and he will write them upon two tables of stone and will give them to me.
And it will be as ye are hearing the voice from the midst of the darkness (and the mount burnt with fire), and ye will come near to me all the heads of your tribes, and your old men;
And ye will say, Jehovah our God caused us to see his glory and his greatness, and his voice we heard from the midst of the fire: this day we saw that God will speak to man and he lived.
And now wherefore shall we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we added to hear the voice of Jehovah our God further, and we died.
For who of all flesh that heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire like us, and shall live?
Come thou near and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say; and thou shalt speak to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to thee: and we heard and we did.
And Jehovah will hear the voice of your words in your speaking to me; and Jehovah will say to me, I heard the voice of the words of this people that they spake to thee: they did well all that they spake.
Who will give, and were this heart in them, for them to fear me and to watch all my commands all the days, so that it shall be well to them and to their sons forever.
Go say to them, Turn back for yourselves to your tents.
And thou, stand thou here with me and I will speak to thee all the commands and the laws and the judgments which thou shalt teach them: and they did it in the land I gave to them to possess it.
And watch ye to do as Jehovah your God commanded right: ye shall not turn aside to the right and to the left.
In all the way that Jehovah your God commanded you, ye shall go, so that ye shall live and it be well to you, and ye prolonged the days upon the land which ye shall possess.
And these the commands and the laws and the judgments that Jehovah you God commanded to teach you to do in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it:
So that thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, to watch all his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee, thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life; and so that thy days shall be prolonged.
And hear, O Israel, and watch to do, that it shall be well to thee, and that ye shall multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers spake to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey.
Hear, Israel; Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.
And love thou Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might.
And these words which I command thee to do shall be upon thy heart;
And sharpen them to thy sons, and speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and in thy lying down and in thy rising up.
And bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for bands between thine eyes.
And write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates.
And it was when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee in to the land which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob, to give to thee cities great and good which thou didst not build,
And houses full of all good which thou filledst not, and wells hewed out which thou hewedst not, and vineyards and olives which thou didst not plant; and thou atest and wert satisfied:
Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants,
Jehovah thy God shalt thou fear, and him shalt thou serve, and in his name shalt thou swear.
Ye shall not go after other gods from the gods of the peoples which are round about you;
(For Jehovah thy God a jealous God in the midst of thee) lest the anger of Jehovah thy God shall kindle against thee and destroy thee from the face of the earth.
Ye shall not try Jehovah your God, as ye tempted in Massah.
Watching, ye shall watch the commands of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his laws that he commanded thee.
And do thou the right and the good in the eyes of Jehovah so that it shall be well to thee, and thou go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers,
To drive out all thine enemies from before thee as Jehovah spake.
When thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying, What the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Jehovah our God commanded you?
And say thou to thy son, We were servants to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt by a strong hand:
And Jehovah will give signs and wonders, great and evil, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his house before our eyes:
And he brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give to us the land which he sware to our fathers.
And Jehovah will command us to do all these laws, to fear Jehovah our God, for good to us all the days, to preserve us alive as this day.
And it shall be justice to us when we shall watch to do all these commands before Jehovah our God as he commanded us.
When Jehovah thy God shall bring thee to the, land where thou goest there to possess it, and he cast out many nations from before thee, the Hittite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite and the Jebusite, seven nations many and strong above thee;
And Jehovah thy God gave them before thee, and thou didst smite them: exterminating, thou shalt exterminate them; thou shalt not make to them a covenant and thou shalt not show them mercy.
Thou shall not marry with them; thy daughters thou shalt not give to his son, and his daughter thou shalt not take to thy son.
For he will turn away thy son from after me and they served other gods: and the anger of Jehovah kindled against you and he destroyed thee suddenly.
But thus shall ye do to them; their altars ye shall destroy, and their pillars ye shall break in pieces, and their statues ye shall cut down, and their carved things ye shall burn in are.
For thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God: in thee Jehovah thy God chose to be to him a people of property from all the peoples which are upon the face of the earth.
Not for your multitude did Jehovah delight in you above all the peoples, and will he choose you, for ye were few more than all the peoples.
For Jehovah loves you and watches the oath which he sware to your fathers: Jehovah brought you out by a strong hand, and he will redeem thee from the house of servants, from the house of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
And know thou that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, watching the covenant and the kindness to those loving him, and to those watching his commands to the thousandth generation:
And recompensing to those hating him to their face to destroy him: he will not delay to him hating him to his face; he will recompense to him.
And watch thou the commands and the laws and the judgments which I command thee this day, to do them.
And it was because ye shall hear these judgments, and watch them and do them, and Jehovah thy God watched to thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware to thy fathers:
And he loved thee and blessed thee, and multiplied thee: and he blest the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy grain and thy new wine and thy new oil, and the young of thy cows and thy flocks of sheep, upon the land which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be in thee barren male and female, and in thy cattle.
And Jehovah turned away from thee all sickness; and all the evil diseases of Egypt which thou knewest, he will not put upon thee: and he will give them upon all hating thee.
And thou didst consume all the peoples which Jehovah thy God gave to thee; thine eye shall not have pity upon them, and thou shalt not serve their gods, for it is a snare to thee.
When thou shalt say in thy heart, The nations many more than I, how shall I be able to dispossess them?
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: remembering; thou shalt remember what Jehovah thy God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
The great trials which thine eyes saw, and the signs and the wonders; and the strong hand and the extended arm by which Jehovah thy God brought thee out: so shall Jehovah thy God do to all people of whose face thou art afraid.
And also the hornet, Jehovah thy God will send among you till the destroying of those being left and of those hiding from thy face.
Thou shalt not be terrified from their faces, for Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a great and fearful God.
And Jehovah thy God cast out these nations from thy face, little, little; thou shalt not be able to finish them quickly lest the beast of the field shall multiply upon thee.
And Jehovah thy God gave them before thee and destroyed and discomfited them in great consternation till he destroyed them.
And he gave their kings into thy hand, and destroy thou their name from under the heavens; and a man shall not stand before thee till thy destroying them.
The carved thing of their gods ye shall burn in fire: thou shalt not desire the silver and gold upon them and take to thee lest thou shalt be snared by it, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
And thou shalt not bring an abomination to thy house, and thou be devoted to destruction like it: abhorring, thou shalt abhor it, and abominating, thou shalt abominate it, for it is devoted to destruction.
All the commands which I command thee this day ye shall watch to do, so that ye shall live and multiply and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers.
And remember thou all the way which Jehovah thy God caused thee to go this forty years in the desert in order to humble thee, to try thee, to know what is in thy heart, whether thou shalt watch his commands or not.
And he will humble thee, and cause thee to hunger, and will give thee to eat manna which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; so that he caused thee to know that upon bread only man shall not live, but upon all going out of the mouth of Jehovah shall man live.
Thy garments decayed not from thee, and thy feet swelled not this forty years.
And know thou with thy heart that as a man will chastise his son, Jehovah thy God chastises thee.
And watch thou the commands of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways and to fear him.
For Jehovah thy God brings thee to a good land, a land of torrents of water, fountains, and depths going forth in the valley and in the mountain;
A land of wheat and barley and the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate, a land of the olive tree, of oil and honey;
A land where thou shalt eat bread in it not with poverty; thou shalt not want any thing in it; a land whose stones, iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt hew out brass.
And thou atest and wert satisfied, and didst bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he gave to thee.
Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, not watching his commands and his judgments and his laws which I command thee this day:
Lest thou shalt eat and thou wert satisfied, and thou wilt build good houses and thou dwelt;
And thy cattle and thy sheep shall multiply, and thy silver and thy gold shall multiply to thee, and all which is in thee shall multiply;
And thy heart was lifted up and thou didst forget Jehovah thy God bringing thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants;
He causing thee to go in the great and fearful desert, the fiery serpent and the scorpion, and a thirsty land, where is no water: he bringing forth to thee water from the rock of flint;
He giving thee to eat manna in the desert which thy fathers knew not, in order to humble thee, and in order to try thee to do thee good in thy lost state:
And thou saidst in thy heart, My strength and the bone of my handmade for me this wealth.
And remember Jehovah thy God; for he gave to thee strength to make wealth in order to set up his covenant, which he sware to our fathers, as this day.
And it was, if forgetting, thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and thou wentest after other gods, and served them and worshipped to them, I testified against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish.
As the nations which Jehovah destroys before you, so shall ye be destroyed, because ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.
Hear, Israel: Thou passest this day over Jordan to go to possess nations great and strong above thee; cities great and fortified to the heavens:
A people great and high, sons of Anakims, whom thou knewest, and thou heardest, Who shall stand before the sons of Anak?
And know thou this day that Jehovah thy God he is passing over before thee; he is a consuming fire, he will destroy them, and he will humble them before thy face, and drive them out and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah spake to thee.
Thou shalt not say in thy heart in Jehovah thy God's thrusting them out from before thee, saying, For my justice Jehovah brought me forth to possess this land; and for the injustice of these nations Jehovah dispossessed them from before thee.
Not for thy justice and for the straightness of thy heart thou goest in to possess this land, but for the injustice of these nations Jehovah thy God dispossesses them from before thee, and order to lift up the word which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham and to Isaak and to Jacob.
And know thou that not for thy justice did Jehovah thy God five to thee this good land to possess it; for thou a people of a hard neck.
Remembering, thou shalt not forget that thou didst provoke Jehovah thy God to anger in the desert: from the day thou didst go out from the land of Egypt till your coming to this place, ye were rebelling against Jehovah.
And in Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to anger, and Jehovah will be angry with you to destroy you.
In my going up to the mount to take the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you, and I shall dwell in the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate not bread and I drank not water:
And Jehovah will give to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and upon them according to all the words which Jehovah spake with you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the gathering.
And it shall be from the end of forty days and forty nights, Jehovah gave to me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant.
And Jehovah will say to me, Arise, go from this mountain; for thy people were corrupted which thou broughtest forth from Egypt; they turned aside quickly from the way which thou didst command them; they made to themselves a molten thing.
And Jehovah will say to me, saying, I saw this people, and behold, it a people of hard neck:
Desist from me and I will destroy them, and I will wipe off their name from under the heavens: and I will make thee into a nation strong and many above them.
And I shall turn and come down from the mount, and the mount burnt with fire: and the two tables of the covenant upon my two hands.
And I shall see, and behold, ye sinned against Jehovah your God; ye made to you a molten calf; ye turned aside quickly from the way which Jehovah commanded you.
And I shall lay hold upon the two tables and I shall cast them from out of my two hands, and shall break them before your eyes.
And I shall fall down before Jehovah as at the first; forty days and forty nights I ate not bread and I drank not water on account of all your sins that ye sinned to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke him.
For I was afraid from the face of the anger and emotion with which Jehovah was angry against you to destroy you. And Jehovah will hear to me also in this time.
And with Aaron Jehovah was greatly angry to destroy him: and I shall pray also for Aaron in that time.
And the sin that ye made, the calf, I took and I shall burn it with fire, and beat it, and grinding small till it was beat small to dust: and I shall cast its dust into the torrent going down from the mount.
And in Taberah and in Massah, and in Kibroth Hatavah, ye were provoking Jehovah to anger.
And in Jehovah's sending you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying; Go ye up and possess the land which I gave to you: and ye will rebel against the mouth of Jehovah your God, and ye trusted not to him, and ye heard not to his voice.
And ye were rebelling against Jehovah from the day I knew you.
And I shall fall down before Jehovah forty days and forty nights, as I fell down; for Jehovah said to destroy you.
And I shall pray to Jehovah, and say, Lord Jehovah, thou wilt not destroy thy people and thine inheritance which thou didst redeem in thy greatness, whom thou broughtest out of Egypt with a strong hand.
Remember thy servants, for Abraham, for Isaak, and for Jacob, thou wilt not look to the stubbornness of this people, and to its wickedness, and to its sin:
Lest they of the land where thou broughtest us from there shall say, For Jehovah was not able to bring them in to the land which he spake to them; and for his hating them he brought them out to destroy them in the desert.
And they are thy people and thine inheritance whom thou broughtest out by thy great strength and by thine extended arm.
In that time Jehovah said to me, Hew to thee two tables of stone as the first, and come up to me to the mount, and make to thee an ark of wood.
And I will write upon the tables the words which were upon the first tables which thou brakest, and put them in the ark.
And I will make the ark of acacia wood, and I will hew two tables of stone as the first, and I will go up to the mount and the two tables in my hands.
And he will write upon the tables according to the first writing, the ten words which Jehovah your God spake out of the midst of the fire, in the day of the gathering: and Jehovah will give them to me.
And I shall turn and come down from the mount, and shall put the tables in the ark which I made; and they shall be there as Jehovah commanded me.
And the sons of Israel removed from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan, to Moseroth: there Aaron died, and he will be buried there; and Eleazar his son will be priest in his stead.
From there they removed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbah, a land of torrents of water.
In that time Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi, to lift up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to serve him, and to praise in his name, even to this day.
For this, there was not to Levi a portion and an inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah, he is his inheritance, as Jehovah thy God spake to him.
And I stood in the mount according to the first days, forty days and forty nights; and Jehovah will hear to me also in this time; Jehovah was not willing to destroy thee.
And Jehovah will say to me, Arise, go for removing before the people, and they shall come in and possess the land Which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
And now, Israel, what does Jehovah thy God ask from thee but to fear Jehovah thy God, to go in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
To watch the commands of Jehovah and his laws which I command thee this day, to be good for thee?
Behold, to Jehovah thy God the heavens, and the heavens of the heavens, the earth and all which is in it.
Only Jehovah delighted in thy fathers to love them, and he will choose in their seed after them in you above all peoples, as this day.
And circumcise the uncircumcision of your heart, and ye shall no more harden your neck.
For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords; the great, the strong, and the fearful God, who will not lift up faces, and will not take a gift.
He did the judgment of the orphan and the widow, and he loved the stranger to give to him bread and a garment.
And love ye the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
Jehovah thy God shalt thou fear; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and in his name shalt thou swear.
He thy praise, and he thy God who did with thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes saw.
With seventy souls thy fathers went down to Egypt; and now Jehovah set thee as the stain of the heavens for multitude.
And love thou Jehovah thy God, and watch his watches and his laws and his judgments and his commands, all the days.
And know ye this day, that not with your sons who knew not, and who saw not the corrections of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his strong hand and his extended arm,
And his signs and his doings which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;
And what he did to the army of Egypt, to his horses and to his chariots, that he caused the water of the sea of sedge to overflow upon their face in their pursuing after you, and Jehovah will destroy them even to this day;
And what he did to you in the desert till your coming to this place;
And what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; that the earth opened her mouth and she will swallow them down, and their houses, and their tents, and every living thing which is at their feet in the midst of all Israel:
For your eyes saw every great doing of Jehovah which he did.
And watch ye every command which I command thee this day, so that ye shall be strengthened and go in and possess the land where ye are passing over there to possess it;
And so that ye shall prolong the days upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed; a land flowing milk and honey.
For the land where thou goest in there to possess it, it is not as the land of Egypt, where ye came from there, when thou shalt sow thy seed, and thou wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of green things:
And the land where ye are passing over there to possess it, a land of mountains and valleys; according to the rain of the heavens it will drink water.
A land which Jehovah thy God sought for it: continually are the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it from the beginning of the year, and even to the last of the year.
And it was if hearing, ye shall hear to the commands which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
And I gave the rain of your land in its time, the early and the latter rain; and gather thy grain and thy new wine and thy new oil.
And I gave the green herb in thy field for thy cattle, and eat thou and be satisfied.
Watch ye to yourselves, lest your heart shall be enticed, and ye turn aside and serve other gods, and worship to them:
And the anger of Jehovah kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens and there shall not be rain, and the land shall not give her produce, and ye perished quickly from off the good land that Jehovah gave to you.
And put these words upon your heart and upon your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they were for bands between your eyes.
And teach them to your sons to speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy walking in the way, and in thy lying down, and in thy rising up.
And write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.
So that your days shall be multiplied, and the days of your sons, upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, according to the days of the heavens upon the earth.
For if watching, ye shall watch all this command which I command you to do it, to love Jehovah thy God, to go in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
And Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you, and ye possessed nations great and strong above you.
Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you shall it be, from the desert and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, and even to the last sea shall be your boundary.
A man shall not stand up against your face: your terror and your fear, Jehovah your God shall give upon the face of all the earth which ye shall tread upon it, as he spake to you.
See, I give before you this day, a blessing and a cursing:
A blessing when ye shall hear to the commands of Jehovah your God which I command you this day;
And a cursing if ye shall not hear to the commands of Jehovah your God, and ye turned aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which thou knewest not.
And it was when Jehovah thy. God shall bring thee in to the land where thou goest in there to possess it, and give thou the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the cursing upon mount Ebal.
Are they not in the other side of Jordan behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite dwelling in the desert over against Gilgal, by the oaks of Moreh?
For ye are passing over Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you; and ye possessed it and dwelt in it.
And watch ye to do all the laws and the judgments which I give before you this day.
These the laws and the judgments which ye shall watch to do in the land which Jehovah the God of thy fathers gave to thee to possess it all the days which ye live upon the earth.
Destroying, ye shall destroy all the places where the nations which ye possess them served there their Gods upon the high mountains, and upon the hills and under every green tree.
And break ye down their altars and break in pieces their pillars, and their columns ye shall burn with fire; and the carved things of their gods ye shall hew down, and destroy their names from that place.
Ye shall not do so to Jehovah your God.
But the place which Jehovah your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, to his dwelling shall ye seek, and there do thou come:
And bring there your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tenths, and the offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your voluntary gifts and the first-born of your cattle and your sheep.
And eat there before Jehovah your God, and rejoice in all the stretching forth of your hand, ye and your houses in which Jehovah thy God blessed thee.
Ye shall not do according to all we do here this day, every man the right in his eyes.
For ye came not yet now to the rest and to the inheritance which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
And pass ye over Jordan and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causes you to inherit, and he caused rest to you from all your enemies from round about, and ye dwelt confidently:
And there was the place which Jehovah your God shall choose in it to cause his name to dwell there; there shall ye bring all which I command you: your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, your tenths, and the offerings of your hands, and all the choice of your vows which ye shall vow to Jehovah.
And rejoice ye before Jehovah your God, ye, and your sons and your daughters, and your servants, and your maids, and the Levite who is in your gates; for not to him a portion and inheritance with you.
Watch to thyself lest thou lift up thy burnt-offering in every place which thou shalt see.
But in the place which Jehovah shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt bring up thy burnt-offering, and there thou shalt do all I command thee.
Only in all the desire of thy soul thou shalt sacrifice and eat flesh according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he gave to thee in all thy gates: the unclean and the clean shall eat it, as the roe and as the stag.
Only the blood thou shalt not eat: upon the earth ye shall pour it as water.
Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy gates the tenth of thy grain, and thy new wine and thy new oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and thy flocks, and all the vows which thou shalt vow, and thy voluntaries, and the offerings of thy hand:
But before Jehovah thy God thou shalt eat it, in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite which is in thy gates: and rejoice thou before Jehovah thy God in all the stretching forth of thy hand.
Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forsake the Levite all thy days upon the earth.
When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy boundary, as he spake to thee, and thou said; I will eat flesh because thy soul shall desire to eat flesh, in all thy soul desired thou shalt eat flesh.
When the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to put his name there shall be far off from thee, and thou shalt sacrifice from thy cattle and from thy sheep which Jehovah gave to thee, as I commanded thee, and eat thou in thy gates in all thy soul desired.
If as he shall eat the roe and the stag, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean and the clean together shall eat it.
Only be striving not to eat the blood, for the blood it is the soul; and thou shalt not eat the soul with the flesh.
Thou shalt not eat it: upon the earth thou shalt pour it as water.
Thou shalt not eat it; so that it shall be well to thee and to thy sons after thee, when thou shalt do right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Only thy holy things which shall be to thee, and thy vows, thou shalt lift up and go to the place which Jehovah shall choose:
And do thou thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of Jehovah thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God, and the flesh thou shalt eat.
Watch and hear all these words which I command thee, so that it shall be well to thee and to thy sons after thee, even till forever; for thou shalt do the good and the right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
For Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations where thou goest in there to possess them, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit them, and thou shalt dwell in their land.
Watch to thyself lest thou shalt be snared after them after their being destroyed from before thee; and lest thou shalt seek to their gods, saying, How shall these nations serve their gods? and so will I do also.
Thou shalt not do so to Jehovah thy God; for every abomination of Jehovah which he hated they did to their gods; for also their sons and their daughters they will burn in fire to their gods.
Every word which I command you, ye shall watch to do it: thou shalt not add upon it, and thou shalt not take away from it.
When there shall arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he gave to thee a sign or a wonder,
And the sign or the wonder come which he spake to thee, saying, We will go after other gods which we know not, and we will serve them,
Thou shalt not hear to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah thy God tries you to know whether ye are loving Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
Ye shall go after Jehovah your God, and ye shall fear him, and his commands shall ye watch, and to his voice shall ye hear, and ye shall serve him, and to him shall ye cleave.
And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall die, for he spake a turning away from Jehovah your God, having brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee from the house of servants, to thrust thee away from the way which Jehovah thy God commanded to go in it: and put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.
When thy brother, the son of thy mother, shall entice thee, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thy soul, in secret, saying, We will go and serve other gods which thou knewest not, thou, and thy fathers;
From the gods of the people which are round about you, coming near to thee, or being far off from thee, from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth;
Thou shalt not be willing to him, and thou shalt not hear to him, and thine eye shall not have compassion upon him, and thou shalt not pity, and thou shalt not cover over him:
But killing, thou shalt kill him; thy hand shall be upon him for the first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people at last.
And stone him with stones and he died, for he sought to thrust thee away from Jehovah thy God, having brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.
And all Israel shall hear, and shall fear, and they shall not add to do this evil in the midst of thee.
When thou shalt hear in one of thy cities which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to dwell there, saying,
Men, sons of Belial went forth from the midst of thee, and they will thrust away the inhabitants of their city, saying, We will go and serve other gods which ye knew not;
And seek, and examine, and ask, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in the midst of you;
Smiting, thou shalt smite the inhabitants of that city with the mouth of the sword, exterminating it, and all that is in it, and its cattle, with the mouth of the sword.
And thou shalt gather all its spoil to the midst of its street, and burn in fire the city and all its spoil, wholly, to Jehovah thy God: and it was a heap forever; it shall no more be built.
And there shall not cleave upon their hand any thing from that devoted to destruction: so that Jehovah shall turn back from the burning of his anger and give to thee mercy, and compassionate thee, as he sware to thy fathers;
When thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch all his commands which I command thee this day, to do the right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.
Ye the sons of Jehovah your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, and ye shall not put baldness between your eyes for the dead.
For thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God, and Jehovah chose in thee to be to him for a people of acquisition above all people which are upon the face of the earth.
Thou shalt not eat any abomination.
These the cattle which thou shalt eat: the ox, the sheep of the lambs, and the sheep of the goats,
The stag, and the roe, and the fallow-deer, and the roe-buck, and the antelope, and the mountain goat, and the gazelle.
And an cattle cleaving the hoof and dividing the cleft into two hoofs, bringing up rumination among the cattle, ye shall eat it.
But this ye shall not eat, from those bringing up rumination, or from those cleaving the hoof of the cleft: the camel and the hare, and the coney; for they bringing up rumination and cleaving not the hoofs; they are unclean to you.
And the swine, because it cleaves the hoof, and not ruminating, it is unclean to you: from their flesh ye shall not eat, and upon their carcass ye shall not touch.
This shall ye eat from all which is in the waters: all which to it are fins and scales, ye shall eat:
And every thing which to it are not fins and scales, ye shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
All clean birds ye shall eat.
And this which ye shall not eat from them: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the sea eagle,
And the vulture, and the kite, and the falcon according to its kind,
And every raven according to his kind,
And the daughter of the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the sea-gull, and the hawk after his kind,
The cormorant, and the ibis and the heron,
And the pelican, and the carrion vulture, and the gannet,
And the stork, and the sand-piper, according to her kind; the hoopoe and the bat.
And every creeping thing flying it is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
Every clean flying thing ye shall eat.
Ye shall not eat any carcass: to the stranger that is in thy gates ye shall give it, and he shall eat it; or sell it to a foreigner: for thou a holy people to Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in his mother's milk.
Taking the tenth, thou shalt take the tenth of all thy produce of thy used of the field bringing forth year by year.
And eat before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, the tenth of thy grain, thy new wine, and thy new oil, and first-born of thy cattle and thy sheep, so that thou shalt learn to fear Jehovah thy God all the days.
And when the way shall be enlarged too much for thee that thou shalt not be able to lift it up; when the place shall be far off from thee which Jehovah thy God shall choose to put his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee:
And give it in silver, and bind up the silver in thy hand, and go to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it.
And give the silver for all which thy soul shall desire, in cattle and in sheep, and in wine, and in strong drink, and in all thy soul shall ask thee: and eat there before Jehovah thy God, and rejoice, thou, and thine house.
And the Levite that is in thy gates thou shalt not forsake him; for to him no portion and inheritance with thee.
From the end of three years thou shalt bring all the tenth of thy produce in that year, and place thou it in thy gates:
And the Levite came (because no portion and inheritance to him with thee) and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which is in thy gates, and ate and were satisfied; so that Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou shalt do.
From the end of seven years thou shalt make a remission:
And this the word of the remission: Every lord to release the lending of his hand which he shall put upon his friend; he shall not exact his friend and his brother, for a remission was called to Jehovah.
Foreigners thou shalt exact of, and what shall be to thee with thy brother thine hand shall remit:
Only when no needy shall be with thee; for Jehovah blessing will bless thee in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it:
Only if hearing, thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch to do all these commands which I command thee this day.
For Jehovah thy God blessed thee as he spake to thee: and thou didst lend to many nations, and thou shalt not borrow; and thou didst rule over many nations, and they shall not rule over thee.
When the needy shall be among thee, from one of thy brethren, in one of thy gates in thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, and thou shalt not shut thy hand from thy needy brother.
For opening, thou shalt open thy hand to him, and lending, thou shalt lend him a sufficiency for his want which he shall want.
Watch to thyself lest a word shall be with thy heart, of Belial, saying. The seventh year, the year of remission is drawing near; and thine eye be evil against thy needy brother and thou wilt not give to him; and he call against thee to Jehovah, and it was sin in thee.
Giving, thou shalt give to him, and thy heart shall not be evil in thy giving to him; for because of this word Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy works, and in all the sending forth of thy hand.
For the needy shall not cease from the midst of thy land: for this I command thee, saying, Opening, thou shalt open thy hand to thy brother, to thy afflicted and to thy needy in thy land.
When thy brother a Hebrew, or Hebrewess, shall be sold to thee, and serving thee six years; in the seventh year thou shalt send him away free from thee.
And when thou shalt send him away free from thee, thou shalt not send him away empty.
Furnishing, thou shalt furnish to him from thy sheep and from thy threshing floor, and from thy wine-vat: with which Jehovah thy God blessed thee thou shalt give to him.
And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah thy God will redeem thee: for I command thee this word this day.
And it was when he shall say to thee, I will not go forth from thee; for he loved thee and thy house, for it was well to him with thee;
And take an awl and give it upon his ear, and against the door, and he was to thee for a servant forever. And also to thy maid shalt thou do thus.
It shall not be hard in thine eye in thy sending him away free from thee, because for the year of the wages of the hireling he served thee six years: and Jehovah thy God blessed thee in all which thou shalt do.
All the first-born that shall be brought forth among thy cattle and among thy sheep, the male thou shalt consecrate to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not work with the first-born of thy bullock, and thou shalt not shear first-born of thy sheep.
Before Jehovah thy God thou shalt eat it year by year, in the place which Jehovah shall choose, thou, and thy house.
And when a blemish shall be in it, lame or blind, any evil blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to Jehovah thy God.
In thy gates thou shalt eat it: the unclean and the clean together, as the roe and the stag.
Only its blood thou shalt not eat: upon the earth shalt thou pour it as water.
Watch the month of Abib, and do the passover to Jehovah thy God: for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night.
And sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God, of the sheep, and the oxen in the place which Jehovah shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
Thou shalt not eat upon it leavened; seven days thou shalt eat upon it unleavened, the bread of affliction; (for in hasty flight thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt) so that thou shalt remember the day of thy coming forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life,
And leaven shall not be seen to thee in all thy boundary seven days; and there shall not remain over night from the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice in the evening, in the first day to the morning.
Thou shalt not be able to sacrifice the passover in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
But at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover in the evening, as the sun went down, the appointment of thy coming out of Egypt.
And boil thou and eat in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it: and turn in the morning and go to thy tents.
Six days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day an enclosing to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do work.
Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: from the beginning of the sickle upon the standing grain, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks.
And do thou the festival of weeks to Jehovah thy God according to the willingness of thy hand which thou shalt give as Jehovah thy God shall bless thee.
And rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite that is in thy gates, and the stranger, and the orphan and the widow, which are in the midst of thee in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
And remember that thou wert a servant in Egypt: and watch thou and do these laws.
The festival of booths thou shalt do to thee seven days, in thy gathering of thy threshing floor and of thy wine press.
And rejoice in thy festival, thou and thy son and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, which are in thy gates:
Seven days shalt thou keep a festival to Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; for Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thy produce and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt surely be joyful.
Three times in a year shall every one of thy males be seen before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose in the festival of unleavened, and in the festival of weeks, and in the festival of booths: and he shall not be seen before Jehovah empty:
Each according to the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he gave to thee.
Judges and scribes shall thou give to thee in all thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee according to thy tribes: and they judged the people just judgment.
Thou shalt not turn away Judgment; thou shalt not look upon and thou shalt not take a gift, for the gift will blind the eyes of the wise and will pervert the words of the just.
Justice, justice shalt thou follow, so that thou live and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
Thou shalt not plant to thee a grove of any wood near the altar of Jehovah thy God which thou shalt make to thee.
And thou shalt not set up to thee a pillar, which Jehovah thy God hates.
Thou shalt not sacrifice to Jehovah thy God an ox and a sheep which shall be in it a blemish, any evil word, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
When there shall be found in the midst of thee in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, a man or a woman who shall do evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to pass by his covenant,
And he will go and serve other gods and will worship to them, and to the sun or to the moon, or to any of the army of the heavens, which I commanded not;
And it was announced to thee, and thou heardest and sought out, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in Israel.
And bring thou forth that man or that woman who did this evil word, to thy gates, the man and the woman, and stone them with stones, and they died.
At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses they shall be put to death; they shall not die by the mouth of one witness.
The hand of the witnesses shall be at first upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. And put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.
When a word shall be hard for thee for judging between blood to blood, between controversy to controversy, and between blow to blow, words of contention in thy gates; and thou didst arise and go up to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it;
And thou didst go to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge which shall be in those days, and seek out; and they shall announce to thee the word of judgment.
And thou shalt do according to the mouth of the word which they shall announce to thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt watch to do according to all which they shall shew thee:
According to the mouth of the precept which they shall shew thee, and according to the judgment which they shall say to thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not turn aside from the word which they shall announce to thee, to the right, and to the left.
And the man which shall do in pride not to hear to the priest, he standing to serve there Jehovah thy God, or to the judge, and that man shall die: and put thou away evil from Israel.
And all the people shall hear, and shall fear, and shall no more act proudly.
When thou shalt come to the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and shall possess it and shall dwell in it, and thou saidst, I will set over me a king according to all the nations which are round about me;
Setting, thou shalt set over thee a king whom Jehovah thy God shall choose in him: from the midst of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a king: thou shalt not be able to set over thee a foreigner who is not of thy brethren.
Only he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall not turn back the people to Egypt in order to multiply the horse: and Jehovah said to you, Ye shall no more add to turn back that way.
And he shall not multiply to him wives, and his heart shall not turn away: and silver and gold he shall not greatly multiply to himself.
And it was when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom and he wrote for him this second law upon a book, from before the priests, the Levites.
And it shall be with him, and he read in it all the days of his life; so that he shall learn to fear Jehovah his God, to watch all the words of this instruction and these laws to do them:
Not to lift up his head above his brethren, and not to turn away from the commands, to the right or to the left; so that he shall prolong the days upon his kingdom he, and his sons in the midst of Israel.
There shall not be to the priests the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, part and inheritance with Israel: the sacrifices of Jehovah and his inheritance they shall eat.
And an inheritance shall not be to him in the midst of his brethren: Jehovah, he is his inheritance, as he spake to him.
And this shall be the judgment of the priests from the people, from those sacrificing a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep; and give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks and the maw.
The first fruits of thy grain, of thy new wine, and thy new oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep thou shalt give to him.
For in him Jehovah thy God chose from all thy tribes to stand to serve in the name of Jehovah, he and his sons all the days.
And when the Levite shall come from one of thy gates from all Israel where he sojourned there, and he came with all the desire of his soul to the place which Jehovah shall choose:
And serving in the name of Jehovah his God as all his brethren the Levites standing there before Jehovah.
Portion according to portion shall they eat, besides his sellings according to the fathers.
When thou comest to the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.
There shall not be found in thee him causing his son or his daughter to pass through in fire, divining divinations, practicing magic, and taking omens and a sorcerer,
And charming a spell, and asking of a necromancer, and a wizard, and seeking to the dead.
For every one doing these things is an abomination to Jehovah And on account of these abominations, Jehovah thy God destroys them from thy face.
Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God.
For these nations which thou shalt possess them, they will hear to those practicing magic, and to those divining: and thou, not thus, gave Jehovah thy God to thee.
A prophet from the midst of thee, from thy brethren, like me Jehovah thy God shall raise up to thee; to him shall ye hear.
According to all thou didst ask from Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in the day of the gathering, saying, I will not add to hear the voice of Jehovah my God, and this great fire I will no more see, and I shall not die.
And Jehovah will say to me, They did well in what they spake.
A prophet will I raise up to them from the midst of their brethren, like thee, and I gave my word in his mouth, and he spake to them all that I shall command him.
And it was the man who shall not hear to my word which he shall speak in my name, I will require from him.
But the prophet which shall act proudly to speak the word in my name which I commanded him not to speak, and who shall speak in the name of other gods, and that prophet died.
And when thou shalt say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah spake not?
The prophet who shall speak in the name of Jehovah, and the word shall not be and shall not come, it is the word that Jehovah spake not; in pride the prophet spake it: thou shalt not be afraid of him.
When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations which Jehovah thy God gave to thee their land, and thou didst possess and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
Three cities shalt thou separate to thee in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to possess it.
Thou shalt prepare to thee the way, and divide into three parts the boundary of thy land which Jehovah thy God causes thee to inherit; and it was for every slayer to flee there.
And this the word of the slayer which shall flee there, and he lived: whoever shall strike his friend, not knowing, and he hated him not from yesterday the third day;
And who shall go with his friend into the forest to cut wood, and his hand thrust out with the axe to out down the tree, and the iron slipped from the wood and found his friend, and he died; he shall flee to one of these cities, and he lived:
Lest the nearest relative of blood shall pursue after the slayer when his heart shall be warm, and overtaking him, for the way shall be great, and he smote him in soul; and to him not the judgment of death for he hated him not from yesterday the third day.
For this I command thee, saying, Three cities thou shalt separate to thee.
And if Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy bound as he sware to thy fathers, and give to thee all the land which he spake to give to thy fathers;
If thou shalt watch all this command to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God and to go in his ways all the days; and thou shalt add to thee yet three cities upon these three.
And innocent blood shall not be poured out in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance, and bloods were upon thee.
And if there shall be a man hating his friend and lying in wait for him, and he rose up against him and smote him in soul, and he died, and he fled to one of these cities:
And the old men of his city sent and took him from there and gave him into the hand of the nearest relative of blood, and he died.
Thine eye shall not pity him and put away innocent blood from Israel, and it was well to thee.
Thou shalt not remove the boundary of thy neighbor which they at first set bounds in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to inherit it.
One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin which he shall sin; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses the word shall be established.
If a witness of wrong shall rise up against a man to testify apostasy against him;
And the two men to whom is the contention stood before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;
And the judges sought out diligently; and behold, a witness of falsehood, the witness of falsehood testified against his brother;
And ye did to him as he purposed to do to his brother: and put away evil from the midst of thee.
And they remaining shall hear, and fear, and shall no more add to do according to this evil word in the midst of thee.
And thine eye shall not pity; soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.
When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemy, and thou sawest horse and chariot, a multitude of people more than thou, thou shalt not be afraid of them, for Jehovah thy God is with thee, he bringing thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And it was in your coming near to the war, and the priest approached and spake to the people,
And he said to them, Hear, O Israel; ye come near this day to war against your enemies: your heart shall not be cast down, ye shall not fear, and ye shall not take flight, and ye shall not be terrified from their face.
For Jehovah your God goes with you to war with you against your enemies, to save you.
And the scribes spake to the people, saying, What man who built a new house and consecrated it not? be shall go and turn back to his house, lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall consecrate it.
And what man who planted a vineyard, and made it not common? He Shall go and turn back to his house lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall make it common.
And what man betrothed a wife and took her not? he shall go and turn back to his house lest he shall die in the war, and another man shall take her.
And the scribes shall add to speak to the people, and they said, What man was afraid and cast down of heart? he shall go and turn back to his house, and he shall not melt his brother's heart as his heart.
And it was as the scribes finished to speak to the people, and they appointed captains of the armies in the head of the people.
When thou shalt come near to a city to war against it, and call peace to it.
And it was, if it shall answer thee peace, and it opened to thee, and it was all the people being found in it shall be to thee for tribute and serve thee.
And if it will not be at peace with thee, and it made war with thee, and thou besieged against it.
And Jehovah thy God gave it into thy hand, and thou didst cut off every one of its males by the mouth of the sword.
Only the women and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that shall be in the city, all its spoil thou shalt plunder to thyself: and eat thou the spoil of thine enemies which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
Thus shalt thou do to all the cities greatly far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations.
Only of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance, thou shalt not preserve alive and breathing:
For destroying, thou shalt destroy them, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Jehovah thy God commanded thee:
So that they shall not teach you to do according to all their abominations to their gods; and ye sinned to Jehovah your God.
When thou shalt besiege against a city many days to war against it, to capture it, thou shalt not destroy its wood to thrust an axe upon it; for from it thou shalt eat: and thou shalt not cut it down; for the man the tree of the field, to go from before thee into the fortress.
Only the tree which thou shalt know that it is not a tree of food, thou shalt destroy it, and cut down, and build a fortress against the city which made way with thee, till it came down.
When there shall be found a wounded in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, to possess it, fallen in the field, not knowing who smote him:
And thy old men and thy judges shall come forth and measure to the cities which are round about him wounded:
And it was the the city being near to the wounded, and the old men of the city took a heifer of the kine which was not worked with, and drew not in the yoke:
And the old men of that city brought down the heifer to a perennial valley which shall not be worked in it, and shall not be sown, and they break there the neck of the heifer in the valley;
And the priests, the sons of Levi, came near, for in them Jehovah thy God chose to serve him and to bless in the name of Jehovah, and by their mouth shall be every controversy and every blow.
And all the old men of that city being near to him wounded, shall wash their hands over the heifer having her neck broken in the valley:
And they answered and said, Our hands poured not out this blood, and our eyes saw not.
Expiate for thy people Israel whom thou didst redeem, O Jehovah, and thou shalt not give innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood was expiated to them.
And thou shalt put away innocent blood from the midst of thee when thou shall do the right in the eyes of Jehovah.
When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemy, and Jehovah thy God gave him into thine hand, and thou didst take him captive,
And thou sawest in the captivity a woman of beautiful form, and thou didst delight in her, and thou didst take her to thee for a wife;
And thou broughtest her to thy house, and she shaved her head and did her nails:
And she put away the garment of her captivity from off her, and she dwelt in thy house, and she wept for her father and her mother a month of days: and after that thou shalt go in to her, and thou wert her lord, and she was for wife to thee.
And it was, if thou didst not delight in her, and thou sentest her away according to her soul; and selling, thou shalt not sell her for silver; and thou shalt not lay hands upon her because thou didst humble her.
When there shall be to a man two wives, the one loved and the one hated, and they bare sons to him, the loved and the hated, and the first-born son was to her being hated:
And it was in the day of his causing his sons to inherit what shall be to him, he shall, not be able to make the son of the loved first-born before the son of the hated, the first-born:
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated, the first-born, to give to him the portion of two in all that shall be found to him; for he is the beginning of his strength; to him is the judgment of the first-born.
If there shall be to a man a son stubborn and rebellious, he not hearing to the voice of his father and to the voice of his mother, and they chastised him, and he will not hear to them:
And his father and his mother laid hold on him and brought him to the old men of his city, and to the gate of his place;
And they said to the old men of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he heard not to our voice; he is vile, and drinking to excess.
And all the men of his city stoned him with stones, and he died: and put thou away evil from the midst of thee, and all Israel shall hear and shall fear.
And when there shall be sin in a man of the judgment of death, and he being put to death, and thou shalt hang him upon a tree:
His carcass shall not pass the night upon the tree; for burying, ye shall bury him in that day, for he being hung is the curse of God; and thou shalt not defile thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.
Thou shalt not see the ox of thy brother or his sheep wandering, and thou shalt not hide from them: turning back, thou shalt turn them back to thy brother.
And if thy brother is not near to thee and thou knew him not, and thou receivedst it in the midst of thy house, and it was with thee till thy brother sought it and thou gavest it back to him.
And so shalt thou do to his ass, and so shalt thou do to his garments, and shalt thou do to all lost things of thy brother which shall be lost from him, and thou didst find it; thou shalt not be able to hide.
Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fallen in the way, and hide from them: lifting up, thou shalt lift up with him.
The equipment of a man shall not be upon a woman, and a man shall not put on a woman's garment, for all doing these things are an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
When a bird's nest shall be found before thee in the way in any tree or upon the earth, the young broods or the eggs, and the mother reclining upon the young birds, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother upon the sons.
Sending, thou shalt send away the mother, and the sons thou shalt take to thee, so that it shall be well to thee and thou prolongedst the days.
When thou shalt build a new house thou shalt make a ledge to thy roof, and thou shalt not put bloods upon thy house, if he shall fall from it.
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with a diversity, lest the fulness of thy seed which thou shalt sow shall be consecrated, and the produce of the vineyard.
Thou shalt not plough with an ox and ass together.
Thou shalt not put on any thing adulterated, wool and linen together.
Thou shalt make to thee twisted threads upon the four wings of thy covering with which thou shalt be covered.
If any man shall take a wife, and went in to her and hated her,
And he set pretexts of words against her, and brought up an evil name upon her, and said, I took this woman, and I shall come near to her, and I found in her not a virgin:
And the father of the young girl took, and her mother, and brought the signs of virginity of the young girl to the elders of the city to the gate:
And the father of the maiden said to the old men, I gave my daughter to this man for a wife and he will hate her,
And behold, he set up pretexts of words, saying, I found not in thy daughter the signs of virginity; and these the signs of my daughter's virginity. And they spread the garment before the old men of the city.
And the old men of that city took the man and chastised him;
And they amerced him a hundred of silver, and gave to the father of the maiden, for he brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be to him for a wife; he shall not be able to send her away all his days.
And if this word was the truth, and the signs of virginity not found for the maiden:
And they brought the maiden to the door of the house of her father, and the men of her city stoned her with stones and she died; for she did folly in Israel to commit fornication in her father's house: and thou didst put away evil from the midst of thee.
When a man shall be found lying with the woman mistress of a husband, and they died, also they two, the man lying with the woman, and the woman: and thou didst put away evil from Israel.
When there shall be a maiden, a virgin, betrothed to a man, and a man found her in the city and lay with her;
And ye brought out them two to the gate of that city, and stoned them with stones, and they died; and the maiden for the word which she cried not in the city, and the man for the word which he humbled his neighbor's wife: and thou didst put away evil from the midst of thee.
And if in the field the man shall find the betrothed maiden, and the man held fast upon her, and lay with her, and the man that lay with her died alone.
And to the maiden thou shalt not do a word; not to the maiden the sin of death: for as a man shall rise up against his friend, and he killed him the soul, so this word.
For in the field he found her, the betrothed maiden cried and none saving her.
When a man shall find a maiden, a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold upon her and lay with her, and they were found;
And the man lying with her gave to the maiden's father fifty of silver, and to him she shall be for a wife; because that he humbled her, he shall not be able to send her away all his days.
A man shall not take his father's wife and shall not uncover his father's wing.
He wounded by crushing, and having the privy member cut off, shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah.
The corrupted shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to him shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah.
An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to them shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah, even forever:
For the word that they met you not with bread and with water in the way in your coming out of Egypt, and who hired against thee Balaam, son of Beor of Pethor, of Arum of the two rivers, to curse thee.
And Jehovah thy God willed not to hear to Balaam: and Jehovah thy God will turn to thee the curse to a blessing, for Jehovah thy God loved thee.
Thou shalt not seek their peace and their good all thy days to forever.
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian for thou wert a stranger in his land.
The sons which shall be begotten to them, the third generation to them shall come in to the gathering of Jehovah.
When the camp shall go forth against thine enemies, and watch thyself from every evil word.
If there shall be in thee a man that shall not be clean from chance of the night, and he shall go forth without the camp; he shall not come in to the midst of the camp:
And it was turning to evening, he shall wash in water: and as the sun went down he shall come into the midst of the camp.
And a hand shall be to thee from without the camp, and thou shalt go forth there without:
And a peg shall be to thee upon thy utensil: and it was in thy sitting down without, and digging with it, and turn thou back and cover thy excrement:
For Jehovah thy God goes in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee, and to give thine enemies before thy face; and thy camp was holy; and he will not see in thee the nakedness of a word and turn back from after thee.
Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his lord who shall be delivered to thee from his lord.
With thee he shall dwell in the midst of thee in the place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, in the good to him: thou shalt not oppress him.
Thou shalt not be a harlot from the daughters of Israel, and a male prostitute from the sons of Israel.
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, and the price of a dog to the house of Jehovah thy God, for any vow: for these two are also an abomination to Jehovah thy God.
Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of silver, interest of food, interest of any word which shall be lent on interest.

When thou shalt vow a vow to Jehovah thy God thou shalt not delay to complete it, for Jehovah thy God requiring, will require it from thee; and it was sin in thee.

That going out of thy lips, thou shalt watch and do according as thou didst vow to Jehovah thy God; a voluntary gift which thou spakest with thy mouth.
When thou shalt come into the vineyard of thy friend, and eat there grapes according to thy soul, to thy satisfying; and thou shalt not give into thy vessel.
When thou shalt come into thy friend's standing grain, pluck off the ears with thine hand, and thou shalt not lift up a sickle upon thy friend's standing grain.
When a man shall take a wife and he married her, and it was if she shall find not favor in his eyes because he found in her a nakedness of the word: and he wrote for her a writing of cutting off, and gave in her hand, and sent her away from his house.
And she shall go out of his house, and go and was to another man.
And the last man hated her and wrote for her a writing of cutting off, and gave in her hand, and sent her away from his house; or if the last man shall die which took her to him for a wife,
Her first husband who sent her away shall not be able to turn back to take her to be to him for a wife after that she was defiled; for it is an abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.
When a man shall take a new wife, he shall not go out in the war, and nothing shall pass upon him for any word: he shall be free to his house one year, and gladden his wife whom he took.
He shall not take the two mill-stones as a pledge, and the rider, for it is taking the soul as a pledge.

Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom was lent to him, shall bring out to thee the pledge without.
And if the man be poor, he shall not sleep with his pledge.
Turning back, thou shalt turn back to him the pledge as the sun went down; he lay down in his garment and blessed thee; and to thee shall be justice before Jehovah thy God.
Thou shalt not oppress the poor and needy hireling from thy brethren, or from thy stranger which is in thy land in thy gates.

The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers: a man shall die in his sin.

And remember that thou wert a servant in the land of Egypt: for this I command thee to do this word.
If there shall be a controversy between men and they drew near to judgment, and they judged them; and they justified the just and condemned the unjust.
And it was if the unjust be the son of smiting and the judge caused him to fall down and beat him before his face in proportion to his fault, by a number.
Forty he shall beat him; He shall not add, lest he shall add to strike him above them with much beating, and thy brother was despised before thine eyes.
Thou shalt not muzzle the ox treading.
If brethren shall dwell together and one of them died, and a son not to him, the wife of the dead shall not be without to a man a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and he took her to him for a wife, and he acted the husband's brother to her.
And it is the first-born which she shall bear shall rise up upon the name of his brother the dead, and his name shall not be wiped from Israel.
And if the man shall not desire to take his brother's wife, and his brother's wife went up to the gate to the old men, and said, My husband's brother refused to raise up to his brother a name in Israel, and he would not act my husband's brother.
And the old men of his city called to him and spake to him: and he stood and said, I desired not to take her.
And his brother's wife drew near to him before the eyes of the old men, and drew off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and answered and said, Thus shall it be done to the man who will not build up the house of his brother.
And his name was called in Israel, The house of him having his shoe drawn off.

Remember what Amalek did to thee in the way, in your coming forth out of Egypt:
That he met thee in the way, and he will smite the rear in thee all the enfeebled behind thee, and thou faint and weary: and he feared not God.
And it was in Jehovah thy God giving rest to thee from all thine enemies from round about in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it, thou shalt wipe out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens; thou shalt not forget.
And it was when thou shalt come into the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance to possess it, and thou didst dwell in it:
And thou tookest from the first of all the fruit of the land which thou shalt bring from thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and put in a basket, and go to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.
And go to the priest which shall be in those days, and say to him, I announced this day to Jehovah thy God, that I came to the land which Jehovah aware to our fathers to give to us.
And the priest took from thy hand the basket and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God.
And thou didst answer and say before Jehovah thy God, An unfortunate Syrian my father; and he went down into Egypt, and he will sojourn there with a few men, and will be there into a great nation, mighty and many.
And the Egyptians did us evil, and humbled us, and they will distribute to us hard service.
And we shall cry to Jehovah the God of our fathers, and Jehovah will hear our voice, and will see our affliction and our labor and our oppression.
And Jehovah will bring us forth out of Egypt with a strong hand and with an extended arm, and with great appearance and with signs and with wonders;
And he will bring us to this place, and will give us this land, a land flowing milk and honey.
And now, behold, I brought the first-fruits of the earth that thou Jehovah gave to me: and set thou it before Jehovah thy God, and worship before Jehovah thy God.

When thou shalt finish to tithe all the tenth part of thy produce, in the third year the year of the tenth part, and thou gavest it to the Levite and to the stranger and to the orphan and to the widow, and they ate in thy gates and were satisfied.
And thou saidst before Jehovah thy God, I took away the holy thing from the house, and also I gave it to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the orphan and to the widow, according to all thy commands which thou didst command me: I passed not by from thy command, and I did not forget.
I ate not from it in my mourning, and I took not away from it in uncleanness, and I gave not from it to the dead: I heard to the voice of Jehovah my God, I did according to all thou didst command me.
Look forth from thy holy habitation, from the heavens, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou gavest to us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land flowing milk and honey.
This day Jehovah thy God commands thee to do these laws and judgments: and watch thou to do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

And being in your passing over Jordan ye shall set up these stones which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and plaster them with lime.
And build there an altar to Jehovah thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up iron upon them.
Whole stones thou shalt build the altar of Jehovah thy God: and bring up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah thy God:
And sacrifice peace, and eat there and rejoice before Jehovah thy God.
And write upon the stones all the words of this law very diligently.
And Moses will speak, and the priests, the Levites, to all Israel, saying, Be silent and hear, Israel; this day thou wert for a people to Jehovah thy God.
And hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God and do his commands and his laws which I command thee this day.
And Moses will command the people in that day, saying,
These shall stand to bless the people upon mount Gerizim, in your passing over Jordan; Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar, and Joseph and Benjamin:
And these shall stand for a cursing upon Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad and Asher and Zebulon, Dan and Naphtali.
And the Levites answered and said to every man of Israel in a high voice,

And it being, if thou shalt not hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God, to watch to do all his commands and his laws which I command thee this day; and all these curses came upon thee, and overtook thee:
Cursed thou in the city, and cursed thou in the field.
Cursed thy basket and thy remainders.
Cursed the fruit of thy belly, and the fruit of thy land, the offspring of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep.
Cursed thou in thy coming in, and cursed thou in thy going out.

Jehovah shall cleave upon thee death, till his consuming thee from the land which thou wentest there to possess it.
Jehovah shall strike thee with consumption, and with burning fever, and with inflammation, and with sword and with burning, and with blasting, and with yellowness: and they shall pursue thee till he have destroyed thee.

Jehovah will give the rain of thy land dust and clay: from the heavens shall it come down upon thee, till he destroyed thee.

Jehovah shall strike thee with the burning sore of Egypt, and with tumors, and with scratching, and with the itch of which thou shalt not be able to be healed.

Thine ox slaughtered before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat from it: thine ass stripped from before thee and shall not turn back to thee; thy sheep, given to thine enemies, and none to thee saving.
Thy sons and thy daughters given to another people, and thine eyes seeing and failing for them all the day: and nothing for the strength of thy hand.
The fruit of thy land and all thy labors, a people which thou knewest not shall eat: and thou wert only oppressed and broken all the days.
And thou wert mad from the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
Jehovah shall strike thee with an evil burning sore upon thy knees and upon thy legs, which thou shalt not be able to heal from the sole of thy foot to thy crown.
Jehovah shall lead thee, and thy king which thou shalt set up over thee, to a nation which thou knewest not thou and thy fathers; and thou servedst there other gods, wood and stone.

And they were upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed even to forever.
Because that thou servedst not Jehovah thy God in joy and in a good heart for the multitude of all things.
And thou servedst thine enemies which Jehovah shall send forth against thee in hunger and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things and he gave a yoke of iron upon thy neck till his destroying thee.
Jehovah shall raise up against thee a nation from far off, from the extremity of the earth, as the eagle shall fly, whose tongue thou shalt not hear;
A nation strong of face who shall not lift up the face to the old man, and shall not compassionate the young.
And it shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land till he destroyed thee: which shall not leave to thee grain, new wine or new oil, the offspring of thine oxen and the flocks of thy sheep, till his destroying thee.
And he passed upon thee in all thy gates until the coming down of thy high and inaccessible fortresses which thou trustest in them in all thy land: and he passed upon thee in all thy gates in all thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.
And thou atest the fruit of thy belly, the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters, which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee:
The man tender in thee, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil upon his brother, and upon the wife of his bosom, and upon the remainder of his sons which he shall leave:
The gift to one of them of the flesh of his sons which he shall eat from: nothing remaining to him of all things in the distress and in the straitness which his enemy shall press upon thee in all thy gates.
She tender and delicate in thee, who tried not to set the sole of her foot upon the earth from delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil upon the husband of her bosom, and upon her son, and upon her daughter,
And upon her afterbirth coming forth from between her feet, and upon her sons which she shall bear: for she will eat them in want of all things, in secret, in the distress and in the straitness which thine enemy shall press upon thee in thy gates.
If thou shalt not watch to do all the words of this law being written in this book, to fear this honored and fearful name JEHOVAH THY GOD;
And Jehovah made thy smiting wonderful, and the smitings of thy seed, great and lasting blows, and evil and lasting diseases.
And he turned back upon thee all the sicknesses of Egypt, of which thou west afraid from their face, and they did cleave to thee.
Also every disease and every blow which is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah will bring them up upon thee, till he destroyed thee.
And ye were left few in extension, instead of which ye were as the stars of the heavens for multitude, because thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah thy God.
And it being as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah shall rejoice over you to destroy you and to cut you off; and ye were torn away from the land which thou wentest in there to possess it.
And Jehovah scattered thee among all peoples from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth; and thou servedst there other gods which thou knewest not, thou and thy fathers, wood and stone.
And among these nations thou shalt not rest, and there shall not be rest to the sole of thy foot: and Jehovah gave to thee there a trembling heart and a wasting away of the eyes, and a faintness of soul.
And thy lives were hung before thee; and thou wert afraid night and day, and thou shalt not trust to thy life.
In the morning thou shalt say, Who shall give evening? and in the evening thou shalt say, Who shall give morning? from the feat of thy heart which thou shalt fear, and from the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
And Jehovah turned thee back to Egypt in ships, in the way; which I said to thee, Thou shalt not add more to see it: and ye were sold there to thine enemies for servants, and for maids, and none buying.
These the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
And Moses will call to all Israel and will say, to them, Ye saw all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
The great temptations which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:
And Jehovah gave not to you an heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even to this day.
And I shall lead you forty years in the desert: your garments did not fall away from you, and thy shoe was not warn away from thy foot.
Bread ye ate not, and wine and strong drink ye drank not; so that ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
And ye shall come to this place; and Sihon, king of Heshbon, will come, and Og, king of Bashan, to our meeting, to war; and we shall smite them.
And we shall take their land and give it for an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites.
And watch ye the words of this covenant, and do them, so that ye shall be circumspect in all things which ye shall do.
Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads of your tribes, your old men, and your scribes, every man of Israel;
Your little ones, your wives and thy stranger which is in the midst of thy camp, from him cutting thy woods to him drawing thy waters:
For thy passing into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God made with thee this day:
In order to set thee this day to him for a people, and he shall be to thee for God as he spake to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob.
And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;
But with those being here with us, standing before Jehovah our God, and with those not here with us this day:
(For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we passed through in the midst of the nations which ye passed through;
And ye shall see their abominations and their rollings, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them:)
Lest there be among you man or woman, or family or tribe, whom his heart turn this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poverty and wormwood;
And it was in his hearing the words of this oath, and he blessed himself in his heart, saying, Peace shall be to me, if in the hardness of my heart, I shall go to add satiating to thirst:
Jehovah shall not be willing to forgive him, for then the anger of Jehovah shall smoke, and his jealousy against that man, and every curse written in this book lay upon him, and Jehovah wiped out his name from under the heavens.
And Jehovah separated him for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the book of this law:
And said, Another generation of your sons who shall rise up from after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a land afar off, and they saw the blows of that land, and the sicknesses which Jehovah made sick in it;
Pitch and burning salt, all its land; it shall not be sown, and it shall not sprout, and no green herb shall come up upon it, as the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:
And all the nations said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?
And they said, Because they left the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he made with them; in his bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.
And they will go and serve other gods, and will worship to them gods which they knew them not, and a portion not to them.
And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against this land, to bring upon it all the curses written in this book.
And Jehovah will tear them up from their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great anger, and will send them to another land as this day.
Hidden things to Jehovah our God: and uncovered things to us and to our sons to forever, to do all the words of this law.
And it being when all these words shall come upon thee, the blessing, and the curse which I gave before thee, and thou shalt turn back to thy heart in all these nations where Jehovah thy God thrust thee away there,
And thou turnedst back to Jehovah thy God, and heardst to his voice according to all which I command thee this day, thou and thy sons, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:
And Jehovah thy God turned back thy captivity, and pitied thee, and he turned back and gathered thee from all the peoples, where Jehovah thy God scattered thee there.
If thy expelling shall be to the end of the heavens, from there thy God will gather thee, and from there he will take thee:
And Jehovah thy God brought thee to the land which thy fathers inherited, and thou inheritedst it: and he did good to thee and multiplied thee above thy fathers.
And Jehovah thy God circumcised thy heart and the heart of thy seed, to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, for the sake of thy life.
And Jehovah thy God gave all these curses upon thine enemies and upon those hating thee, who chased thee.
And thou shalt turn back and hear to the voice of Jehovah, and do all his commands which I command thee this day.
And Jehovah thy God caused thee to abound in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land for good: for Jehovah will turn back to be glad over thee for good as he was glad over thy fathers:
If thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch his commands and his laws written in the book of this law, if thou shalt turn back to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
For this command which I command thee this day, it was not great for thee, and it was not far off.
It is not in the heavens to say, Who shall go up for us to the heavens to take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?
And it is not beyond the sea, to say, Who shall pass over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it to us and cause us to hear it and do it?
For the word is very near to thee in thy mouth and in thy heart to do it.
See, I gave before thy face this day the life and the good, and the death and the evil;
That I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways, to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments, and live thou and multiply: and Jehovah thy God blessed thee in the land which thou wentest there to possess it.
And if thy heart shall turn aside and thou shalt not hear, and be thrust away and worship to other gods, and serve them;
I announced to you this day that perishing, ye shall perish; ye shall not prolong the days upon the land which thou passest over Jordan to go in there to possess it.
I called to witness against you this day the heavens and the earth, the life and the death I gave before thee, the blessing and the curse: and choose upon life, so that thou shalt live, thou and thy seed:
To love Jehovah thy God; to hear to his voice and to cleave to him (for this thy life and the length of thy days) to dwell upon the land which Jehovah aware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob, to give to them.
And Moses will go and speak these words to all Israel.
And he will say to them, The son of a hundred and twenty years I this day; I shall no more be able to go out and to come in: and Jehovah said to me, Thou shalt not pass through this Jordan.
Jehovah thy God he goes over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and possess thou them: Joshua he passes over before thee as Jehovah spake.
And Jehovah did to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their land which be destroyed them.
And Jehovah gave them before you, and ye did to them according to all the commands which I commanded you.
Be strong and be active; ye shall not fear, and ye shall not be terrified from their face, for Jehovah thy God, he goes with thee; he will not relax thee and he will not forsake thee.
And Moses will call to Joshua and say to him before the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and be active, for thou shalt go in with this people to the land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers to give to them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
And Jehovah he goes before thee; he shall be with thee; he will not relax thee, and he will not forsake thee; thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be dismayed.
And Moses will write this law and will give it to the priests, the sons of Levi, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the old men of Israel.
And Moses commanded them, saying, From the end of seven years, in the appointment of the year of remission in the festival of tents,
In the coming of all Israel to see the face of Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their ears.
Gather the people, the men and the women and the little ones and thy stranger which is in thy gates, so that they shall hear, and so that they shall learn and fear Jehovah your God, and watch to do all the words of this law:
And their sons which knew not shall hear and shall learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days which they lived upon the land which ye pass over Jordan there to possess it.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thy days draw near to die: call Joshua, and stand ye in the tent of appointment, and I will command him. And Moses will go, and Joshua, and they will stand in the tent of appointment.
And Jehovah will be seen in the tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of the cloud will stand at the door of the tent.
And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold thee lying down with thy fathers, and this people rising up and committing fornication after the gods of the foreigner of the land where he going there in the midst of him, and he forsook me and brake my covenant which I made with him.
And my anger was kindled against him in that day, and I forsook them, and I hid my face from them, and he was for consuming, and many evils finding him, and afflictions, and he said in that day, Is it not because God is not in the midst of me these evils find us?
Hiding, I will hide my face in that day for all the evils which he did, for he turned to other gods.
And now write ye for you this song, and teach it to the sons of Israel: put it in their mouth so that this song shall be to me for a testimony among the sons of Israel.
For I shall bring him to the land which I sware to his fathers, flowing milk and honey; and he ate and was satisfied and was fat, and turned to other gods, and they served them and despised me and brake my covenant.
And it was when many evils and afflictions shall find him, and this song testified before him for a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouth of his seed; for I knew his formation which he did this day, before I shall bring him to the land which I sware.
And Moses will write this song in that day, and will teach it to the sons of Israel.
And he will command Joshua the son of Nun, and will say, Be strong and active: for thou shalt bring in the sons of Israel to the land which I sware to them, and I will be with thee.
And it shall be when Moses finished to write the words of this law upon a book until he finished them;
And Moses will command the Levites lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying,
Take the book of this law and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and it was there for a witness against thee.
For I knew thy rebellion and thy hard neck: behold, in my yet living with you this day, ye were rebelling against Jehovah; and much more after my death.
Gather to me all the old men of your tribes and your scribes, and I will speak in their ears these words, and I will take the heavens and the earth to witness against them.
For I knew after my death that acting wickedly, ye will be corrupted, and turn aside from the way that I commanded you; and evil met you in the last of the days, for ye will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to Make him angry in the work of your hands.
And Moses will speak in the ears of all the gathering of Israel the words of this song till he finished them.
Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; Thou earth shalt hear the words of my mouth.
My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My word shall pour out as the dew, As the showers upon the herbage, And as the rains upon the green herb:
For I will call the name of Jehovah: Give ye greatness to our God.
The Rock, his work complete: For all his ways judgment: A God of faithfulness and not of iniquity Just and right is he.
He acted wickedly to him; not his sons their blot: A generation perverted and crooked.
To Jehovah will ye recompense this, A people foolish and not wise? He thy father: did he not buy thee? He made thee, and he will protect thee.
Remember the days of eternity; Discern the years of generation and generation: Ask thy father, and he will announce to thee; Thy old men, and they shall say to thee.
The Most High distributing the nations, In his dispersing the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel.
For Jehovah the portion of his people; Jacob the cord of his inheritance.
He will find him in the land of the desert, In a waste howling desolation: He will encompass him about; he will teach him, He will keep him as the pupil of the eye.
As the eagle he will arouse his young brood, He will brood over his young birds; He will spread out his wings, and will take them; He will lift them up upon his wings:
Jehovah alone will lead him, And no strange god with him.
He will cause him to ride upon the heights of the land; He shall eat the produce of the field; And he shall suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flint of the rock.
Curdled milk of the cow, and milk of the sheep, With the fat of lambs, And rams, sons of Bashan, and he goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; Thou shalt drink wine, the blood of the grape.
And Jeshurun will be fat and will tread down: Thou wert fat, thou wert thick, thou wert covered; And he will reject God having made him, And he will despise the Rock of his deliverance.
He will cause him to be jealous with strangers, With abominations they will irritate him.
They will sacrifice to demons, not God; Gods they have not known them New ones came out from the midst; Your fathers not having feared them.
Thou wilt forsake the Rock begetting thee, And thou wilt forget God setting thee free.
And God will see and will reject, From the irritating of his sons and his daughters.
And he will say, I will hide my face from them; I will see what shall be after them: For they a generation of perverseness, Sons no faith in them.
They made me jealous with not God; They irritated me with their vanities: And I will make them jealous with not a people; With a foolish nation will I irritate them.
For a fire was kindled in mine anger. And it shall burn to the lowest hades, And it shall consume the land and its produce, And it shall burn the foundations of the mountains.
I will gather evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.
Exhausted with hunger, consumed with burning, And bitter destruction: And I will send upon them the tooth of beasts, With the wrath of those crawlers of the dust.
The sword shall bereave without, And terror from the chambers, Also the youth, also the virgin, The suckling, with the man of gray hair.
I have said I will blow them away, I will turn away their remembrance from man;
Unless I shall fear the enemy's their adversaries shall dissemble, Lest they shall say, Our high hand And not Jehovah did all this.
For they a nation destroying counsels, And no understanding in them.
Would they were wise! will they look at this? Will they discern to their latter part?
How shall one chase a thousand; And two shall cause ten thousand to flee, If that their Rock had not sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?
For their rock not as our Rock, And our enemies judging.
For their vine from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes the grapes of poverty, The clusters of bitterness to them.
Their wine the wrath of dragons, And the fierce head of asps.
Is not this laid up with me, Sealed up in my treasuries?
To me vengeance and requital; At the time their foot shall waver: For the day of their destruction is near, And he hastened things prepared for them.
For Jehovah will judge his people, And upon his servants will he have compassion; When he shall see that the hand has failed, And nothing detained and left.
And he said, Where their gods, The rock they trusted in it?
Whose fat of their sacrifices they shall eat; They shall drink the wine of their libations They shall rise up, and they shall succor you, It shall be for you protection.
See ye now, that I, I am he, And no God with me: I will kill, and I will preserve alive; I struck through and through, and I will heal; And none takes away out of my hand.
For I will lift up my hand to the heavens, And I said, I live forever.
If I sharpened the lightning of my sword, And my hand shall lay hold upon judgment, I will turn back vengeance to mine adversaries, And to those hating me I will requite,
I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall eat flesh, From the blood of the wounded and the captivity, From the head of the enemy's leaders.
Rejoice ye nations with him, For he will raise up the blood of his servants, And he will turn back vengeance to his adversaries, And he will expiate for his land, his people.
And Moses will come and speak all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua, son of Nun.
And Moses will finish speaking all these words to all Israel:
And he will say to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I call upon you to witness this day, which ye shall command your sons to watch and to do, all the words of this law.
For it is not an empty word for you, but it is your life; and in this word ye shall prolong the days upon the land which ye pass through Jordan there to inherit it.
And Jehovah will speak to Moses in this self-same day, saying,
Come up to this mountain Abarim, the mountain Nebo, which is in the lend of Moab against the face of Jericho; and see the land of Canaan which I gave to the sons of Israel for a possession.
And die in the mountain which thou earnest there, and be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount for and was gathered to his people:
Because ye acted treacherously against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of contradiction, of Kadesh in the desert Zin; because ye consecrated me not in the midst of the sons of Israel.
But thou shalt see the land from before, and thou shalt not come in there to the land which I gave to the sons of Israel.
And this the blessing which Moses the man of God praised the sons of Israel before his death.
And he will say, Jehovah came from mount Sinai, and he rose up from Seir to them; he shone forth from mount Peran, he came from ten thousand of Kadesh; from his right hand a fire of law for them.
Surely, he loved the peoples; all his holy ones in thy hand: they lay down at thy foot; and he will take of thy words.

He saying to his father and to his mother, I saw him not, and his brethren he knew not, and he knew not his sons; for they watched thy sayings and they will keep thy covenant.
And they shall teach thy judgments to Jacob, and thy law to Israel; they will put incense at thy nose, and whole burnt-offerings upon thine altar.
Bless, Jehovah, his strength, and thou wilt accept the work of his hands: smite through and through the loins of those rising up against him, and those hating him, lest they shall rise up.
To Benjamin he said, The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell confidently by him; he covered over him all the day, and he dwelt between his shoulders.

And from the most excellent of the produce of the sun, and from the most excellent thrust forth of the moons,
And from the head of the mountains of the beginning, and from the most excellent of the perpetual hills,
And from the most excellent of the earth and its fulness, and the acceptance of him dwelling in the bramble: it shall come to the head of Joseph, and to the crown of the consecrated of his brethren.
The honor to him the first-born of the bullock, his horns the horns of the unicorn: with them he will thrust the peoples together to the extremity of the earth: these the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these the thousands of Manasseh
And to Zebulon he said, Rejoice, Zebulon, in thy going forth, and Issachar, in thy tents.

And to Gad he said, Blessed he enlarging Gad: he dwelt as a lion, and he tore up the arm, also the crown.

Thy bolt, iron and brass; and as thy days, thy rest.
None as the God of Jeshurun, riding the heavens in thy help and in his lifting up the choirs.
The God of the beginning testifying, and underneath, the perpetual arms: and he will thrust out the enemy from before thee, and will say, Destroy.
And Israel shall dwell confidently alone; the eye of Jacob upon a land of grain and new wine, also his heavens shall drop dew.
Happy, thou, Israel: who like thee, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of thy help, and who the sword of thy lifting up and thine enemies will lie to thee, and thou wilt tread upon their heights.
And Moses will go up from the desert of Moab to mount Nebo, the head of Pisgah, which is upon the face of Jericho: and Jehovah will cause him to see all the land of Gilead, even to Dan.

According to all the signs and the wonders which Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants, and to all his land;
According to the strong hand, and according to the great fear which Moses did before the eyes of all Israel.
And it will be after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah will say to Joshua, son of Nun, serving Moses, saying,
Moses my servant died; and now arise, pass through this Jordan, thou and all this people, to the land which I gave to them to the sons of Israel.
Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you I gave it as I spake to Moses.
From the desert and this Lebanon, and even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and even to the great sea, from the going down of the sun, shall be your bound.
No man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, I will be with thee: I will not forsake thee and I will not leave thee.
Be strong and be active; for thou shalt cause Israel to inherit the land which I sware to their fathers to give to them.
Only be strong and be greatly active, to watch to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: thou shalt not turn aside from it to the right and to the left, so that thou shalt be wise in all things where thou shalt go.
And the book of this law shall not depart from thy mouth; and meditate thou in it day and night, so that thou shalt watch to do according to all written in it: for then thou shalt prosper thy ways, and then thou shalt be wise.

Till Jehovah shall cause rest to your brethren as you and they also shall inherit the land which Jehovah your God gave to them: and ye turned back to the land of your possession, and ye shall inherit it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to you on the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun.
And they will answer Joshua, saying, All which thou didst command us, we will do, and where thou shalt send us, we will go.
According to all that we heard to Moses, so will we bear to thee: only Jehovah thy God shall be with thee as he was with Moses.

And Joshua son of Nun will send out of Shittim two men spying silently, saying, Go see the land and Jericho. And they will go, and will come to the house of a woman, a harlot, and her name Rahab; and they will lie there.

And the king of Jericho will send to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men having come to thee, which came to thy house: for to search out the land they came.
And the woman will take the two men and hide them, and will say thus, Two men came to me, and I knew not from whence they were.
And it will be for the shutting the gate in darkness, and the men went forth, and I knew not whither the men went; pursue quickly after them, for ye shall overtake them.
And she brought them up to the roof, and she will hide them in woody flax arranged by her upon the roof.
And the men pursued after them the way of Jordan at the passages: and they shut the gate afterwards as they pursuing after them went forth.
And before they will lie down; and she went up to them upon the roof;
And she will say to the men, I knew that Jehovah gave to you the land, and that your terror fell upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melted from your face.
For we heard that Jehovah dried up the water of the sea of sedge from before you, in your coming out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were upon the other side of Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye destroyed them.
And hearing, our heart will melt and there rose up no more spirit in a man on account of your face: For Jehovah your God, he the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth beneath.
And now, swear now to me by Jehovah, as I did with you mercy, and do ye also mercy with the house of my father, and give to me a true sign.
And preserve alive my father and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all which is to them, and take away our souls from death.

And it was all which went forth out of the doors of thy house without, his blood upon his head and we are free, and all which shall be with thee in the house, his blood upon our head if a hand shall be upon him.
And if thou shalt announce this our word, and we were free from thine oath which thou didst cause us to swear.
And she will say, According to your words so be it. And she will send them away and they will go: and she will bind the scarlet cord in the window.
And they will go, and will come to the mountain, and will dwell there three days till they pursuing turned back: and they pursuing will seek in all the way, and they found not.

And Joshua will say to the people, Consecrate yourselves, for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonderful things in the midst of you.

And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I will begin to make thee great in the eyes of all Israel, that they shall know that as I was with Moses I will be with thee.
And thou shalt command the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye come to the extremity of the water of Jordan ye shall stand in Jordan.
And Joshua will say to the sons of Israel, Come near here and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
And Joshua will say, By this ye shall know that the living God is in the midst of you; and destroying, he will destroy from your face the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passing through before you into Jordan.
And now take to you twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man, one man to a tribe.
And it was as the soles of the feet of the priests lifting up the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, rested in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters coming down from above; and they shall stand one heap.
And it shall be in the people's removing from their tents to pass through Jordan, and the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant before the people;
And as they lifting up the ark come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests lifting up the ark were dipped in the extremity of the waters (and Jordan was filled up to all its banks all the days of harvest,)
And the waters coming down from above will stand, they rose up one heap very far off in Adam, the city which is by the side of Zaretan; and coming down upon the sea of the desert, the salt sea, they ceased, they were cut off: and the people passed through over against Jericho.
And the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah will stand firm upon the dry land that in the midst of Jordan, and all Israel passing over upon the dry till all the peoples finished to pass over Jordan.
And it shall be as all the people finished passing over Jordan, and Jehovah will say to Joshua,
Take to you from the people twelve men, one man, one man from a tribe;
And command ye them, saying, Take up to you from hence out of the midst of Jordan from the firm standing of the feet of the priests, twelve stones, and pass them over with you, and deposit them in the lodging place where ye shall remain in it the night.
And Joshua will call to the twelve men whom he prepared from the sons of Israel, one man, one man from a tribe:
And Joshua will say to them, Pass ye over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of Jordan, and lift up to you each one stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel:
So that this shall be a sign in the midst of you, when your sons shall ask to-morrow, saying, What these stones to you?
And say ye to them that the waters of Jordan were cut off from before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; in its passing through Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones were for a remembrance to the sons of Israel even to forever.
And the sons of Israel will do so as Joshua commanded, and they will lift up the twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as Jehovah spake to Joshua according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and they will pass them over with them to the lodging place, and they will deposit them there.
And Joshua raised up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place of the standing of the feet of the priest lifting up the ark of the covenant: and they shall be there till this day.
And the priests lifting up the ark standing in the midst of Jordan, till all was finished which Jehovah commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all which Moses commanded Joshua: and the people will haste and will pass through.
And it will be as all the people finished passing over, and the ark of Jehovah will pass through, and the priests before the people.
And the sons of Reuben will pass through, and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, brave in battle, before the sons of Israel, as Moses spake to them.
About forty thousand drawn out for war, passed over before Jehovah to war, to the desert of Jericho.
In that day Jehovah made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, and they will fear him as they feared Moses all the days of his life.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, saying,
Command the priests lifting up the ark of the testimony, and they shall come up out of Jordan.
And Joshua will command the priests, saying, Come up out of Jordan.
And it will be in the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah coming up from the midst of Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were plucked up to the dry land, and the waters of Jordan will turn back to their place and will go as yesterday the third day, over all its banks.
And the people came up out of Jordan in the tenth to the first month, and they will encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity of the sunrising of Jericho.
And these twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, Joshua set in Gilgal.
And he will say to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons shall ask their fathers to-morrow, saying, What these stones?
And make ye known to your sons, saying, Upon dry land Israel passed through this Jordan.
That Jehovah your God dried up the water of Jordan from before you till your passing through as Jehovah your God did to the sea of sedge which he dried up from before us till our passing through:
So that all the people of the earth knew the hand of Jehovah that it is strong: so that ye shall fear Jehovah your God all the days.
And it will be as all the kings of the Amorites heard which were beyond Jordan to the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanites which were upon the sea, that Jehovah dried up the water of Jordan from before the sons of Israel till we passed over, and their heart will melt; and there was no more spirit in them from the face of the sons of Israel.
In that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make to thee swords of stone, and turning back, circumcise the sons of Israel the second time.
And Joshua will make to him swords of stone and will circumcise the sons of Israel at the hill of uncircumcisions:
And this the reason that Joshua circumcised: all the people came forth out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt.
For all the people coming out were circumcised; and all the people born in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt, were not circumcised.
For forty years the sons of Israel went in the desert till all the people of the men of war coming out of Egypt were finished, who heard not to the voice of Jehovah: which Jehovah sware to them, not for them to see the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing milk and honey.
And their sons he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, for they circumcised them not in the way.
And it shall be as all the people finished to be circumcised, and they dwelt in their place in the camp till they revived.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he will call the name of that place Gilgal till this day.
And the sons of Israel will encamp in Gilgal, and they will do the passover in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plain of Jericho.
And they will eat from the grain of the land from the morrow of the passover, unleavened and roasted in the self-same day.
And the manna will cease from the morrow in their eating from the grain of the land; and manna was no more to the sons of Israel; and they will eat from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.
And it will be in Joshua's being by Jericho, and he will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold, a man standing before him and his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua will go to him and say to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?
And he will say, No; but I chief of the army of Jehovah come now. And Joshua will fall on his face to the earth and will worship him, and will say to him, What speaks my lord to his servant?
And the captain of Jehovah's host will say to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from thy foot, for the place which thou standest upon it, it is holy: and Joshua will do so.
And Jericho was shut up; and being shut up from before the sons of Israel, none will come out and none came in.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, See, I gave into thy hand Jericho and her king, and the mighty ones of strength.
And encompass the city all ye men of war, and surround the city one time: so shalt thou do six days.
And seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark: and in the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall clang the trumpets.
And it was in prolonging upon the horn of the jubilee in your hearing, the voice of the trumpet, and all the people shall shout a great shout: and the walls of the city shall fall under it, and the people went up each before him.
And Joshua son of Nun will call to the priests and say to them, Lift up the ark of the covenant, and seven priests shall lift up seven trumpets of signals before the ark of Jehovah.
And they will say to the people, Pass through and surround the city, and he being armed shall pass by before the ark of Jehovah.
And it will be as Joshua said to the people, and the seven priests lifting up the seven trumpets of alarms before Jehovah, passed by and clanged upon the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them.
And he being armed, went before the priests that clanged with the trumpets, and the gathering went after the ark, going and clanging with the trumpets.
And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, and ye shall not cause your voice to be heard, and a word shall not go forth out of your mouth till the day I said to you, Shout, and shout ye.
And the ark of Jehovah will encompass the city, surrounding one time: and they will come into the camp and will pass the night in the camp.
And Joshua will rise early in the morning, and the priests will lift up the ark of Jehovah.
And seven priests lifting up seven trumpets of alarms before the ark of Jehovah went on going, and they clanged with the trumpets, and he being armed went before them; and the gathering went after the ark of Jehovah, going and clanging with the trumpets.
And they will surround the city in the second day one time, and they will turn back to the camp. So they did six days.
And it will be in the seventh day, and they will rise early in the ascending of the dawn, and they will encompass the city according to this judgment seven times; only in that day they encompassed the city seven times.
And it will be in the seventh time the priests clanged with the trumpets and Joshua will say to the people, Shout; for Jehovah gave to you the city.
And the city was devoted, it, and all which is in it, to Jehovah: only Rehab the harlot shall live; she and all which with her in the house, because she hid the messengers which we sent.
And ye, watch ye from the devoted thing lest ye shall be devoted, and ye take from the devoted thing and ye set the camp of Israel to be devoted, and ye troubled it.
And all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron, it holy to Jehovah: it shall be brought to the treasury of Jehovah.
And the people will shout and clang with the trumpets: and it will be as the people heard the voice of the trumpet, and the people will shout a great shout, and the wall will fall under it, and the people will go up to the city, each before him, and they will take the city.
And they will devote all which in the city, from man and even to woman, and from the youth even to the old man, and ox and sheep and ass, to the mouth of the sword.
And to the two men spying the land Joshua said, Go in to the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring forth from thence the woman and all which is to her, as ye sware to her.
And the young men spying will go in and bring forth Rehab, and her father and her mother and her brethren, and all which is to her; and all her families they will bring forth, and they will leave them without the camp of Israel.
And they burnt the city in fire and all which is in it: only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and iron they gave to the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
And Rahab the harlot, and the house of her father and all which is to her, Joshua preserved alive; and she will dwell in the midst of Israel till this day, because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent out to spy Jericho.
And Joshua will swear in that time, saying, Cursed the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho: in his first-born he shall lay its foundation and in his younger he shall set up its doors.
And Jehovah will be with Joshua; and his fame will be in all the land.
And the sons of Israel will transgress a transgression in the devoted thing: and Achan, son of Carmi son of Zabdi, son of Zerah to the tribe; of Judah, will take from the devoted thing: and the anger of Jehovah will kindle against the sons of Israel.
And Joshua will send men from Jericho to Ai, which is by the house of Ain, from the east, to the house of God, and he will say to them, saying, Go up and spy the land. And the men will go up and will spy Ai.
And they will turn back to Joshua, and will say to him, All the people shall not go up; about two thousand men or about three thousand men shall go up and smite Ai: thou shalt not weary there all the people for they few.
And they will go up there from the people about three thousand men: and they will flee from the face of the men of Ai.
And the men of Ai will smite of them about thirty and six men; and they will pursue them before the gate, even to Shebarim; and they will smite them in going down, and the heart of the people will melt and will be as water.
And Joshua will rend his garments and will fall upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah even till evening, he and the old men of Israel; and they will lift up dust upon their heads.
And Joshua will say, Ah! Lord Jehovah, wherefore, passing over, didst thou cause this people to pass over Jordan, to give us into the hand of the Amorite, to destroy us? and would we were contented and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.
With leave, O Lord, what to say, after that Israel turned back the neck before his enemies.
And the Canaanite and all inhabiting the land shall hear, and they encompassed about us, and they cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Rise up; for thyself wherefore this didst thou fall upon thy face?
Israel sinned and also passed by my covenant which I commanded them: and also they took from the devoted thing, and also stole, and also lied, and also put in their vessels.
And the sons of Israel shall not be able to rise up before their enemies; they will turn the neck before their enemies for they were for a devoted thing: I will not add to be with you if ye ill not destroy the devoted thing from the midst of you.
Arise, consecrate the people, and say, Be ye consecrated for the morrow: for thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, A devoted thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou shalt not be able to rise up before thine enemy till your removing the devoted thing from the midst of you.
And come near in the morning according to your tribes: and it was the tribe which Jehovah shall take of us shall come near according to the families; and the family which Jehovah shall take shall come near according to houses; and the house which Jehovah shall take shall come near according to the men.
And it was he being taken with the devoted thing shall be burnt in fire, he and all which is to him: for he passed by the covenant of Jehovah, and because he did folly in Israel.
And Joshua will rise early in the morning, and he will bring Israel near according to his tribes; and he will take the tribe of Judah.
And he will bring near the family of Judah; and he will take the family of the Zarhites: and he will bring near the family of the Zarhites according to the men; and Zabdi will be taken.
And he will bring near his house according to the men, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, to the tribe of Judah, will be taken.
And Joshua will say to Achan, My son, set now, honor to Jehovah the God of Israel, and give to him confession; and announce now to me what thou didst; thou shalt not hide from me.
And Achan will answer Joshua and will say, Truly, I sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and according to this, and according to this I did.
And I shall see in the plunder a wide cloak of Shinar, a good one, and two hundred shekels of silver and one tongue of gold of fifty shekels from its weight, and I shall desire them, and shall take them, and behold them hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
And Joshua will send messengers, and they will run to the tent, and behold, the hiding in his tent, and the silver under it.
And they will take them from the midst of the tent and will bring them to Joshua, and to all the sons of Israel, and they will pour them out before Jehovah.
And Joshua will take Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the wide cloak, and the tongue of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep and his tent, and all which is to him, and all Israel with him, and they will bring them up to the valley of Achor.
And Joshua will say, Why didst thou trouble us? Jehovah will trouble thee in this day, and all Israel will stone him with stone, and they will burn them in fire, and they will stone them with stones.
And they will raise up upon him a great heap of stones even till this day. And Jehovah will turn back from the wrath of his anger: for this, the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, even to this day.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be terrified: take with thee all the people of war, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I gave into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people and his city and his land:
And do to Ai and to her king as thou didst to Jericho and to her king: only its plunder and her cattle ye shall plunder to yourselves: set to thee an ambush to the city from behind it.
And Joshua will rise, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai: and Joshua will choose thirty thousand men mighty of strength, and he will send them by night.
And he will command them, saying. See, ye lie in wait against the city, behind the city: ye shall not be far off from the city greatly, and be ye all of you prepared:
And I and all the people that are with me will draw near to the city: and it was when they shall come forth to our meeting as at the first, and we fled before them.
And they will come out after us, and we drew them away from the city, for they will say, They flee before us as at the first: and we fled before their face.
And ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city: and Jehovah your God gave it into your hand.
And it was when ye seize the city, ye shall set the city on fire: according to the word of Jehovah ye shall do: See, I commanded you.
And Joshua will send them away; and they will go to the ambush, and they will dwell between the house of God and between Ai, from the sea to Ai: and Joshua will remain in that night in the midst of the people.
And Joshua will rise early in the morning and will review the people, and he will go up, and the old men of Israel, before the people of Ai.
And all the people of war that were with him went up, and they will draw near, and come before the city, and will encamp on the north to Ai: and the valley between them and Ai.
And he will take about five thousand men and set them in ambush between the house of God and between Ai, from the sea, to the city.
And the people will set all the camp which is from the north to the city, and its lying in wait, from the sea to the city; and Joshua will go in that night into the midst of the valley.
And it will be when the king of Ai saw, and they will hasten and will rise early, and the men of the city will come forth to the meeting of Israel, to war, he, and all his people, at the appointment before the desert: and he knew not that an ambush to him from behind the city.
And Joshua and all Israel will be smitten before them, and will flee the way of the desert.
And all the people which are in the city will be called together to pursue after them, and they will pursue after Joshua, and be drawn away from the city.
And a man was not left in Ai and the house of God, who will not go forth after Israel: and they will leave the city opened and will pursue after Israel.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Stretch with the javelin which is in thine hand, to Ai; for into thine hand will I give it. And Joshua will stretch forth with the javelin which in his hand, to the city.
And the ambush rose quickly from its place, and they will run when he stretched out his hand: and they will come into the city and take it, and they will hasten and set the city on fire.
And the men of Ai will turn back behind them and will see, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens, and there was not with them hands to flee hither and thither: and the people having fled, turned back to the pursuers.
And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush took the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, and they will turn back and smite the men of Ai.
And these will go forth from the city to their meeting; and they will be to Israel in the midst of these from hence, and these from thence: and they will smite them till none were left to them fleeing and escaping.
And the king of Ai they seized, living, and they will bring him to Joshua.
And it will be when Israel finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the desert, where they pursued them in it, and all of them will fall before the mouth of the sword till they were finished, and all Israel will turn back to Ai and will smite it by the mouth of the sword.
And it will be, all falling in that day from men, even to women, twelve thousand; all the men of Ai.
And Joshua turned not back his hand which he stretched out with the spear till he exterminated all the inhabitants of Ai.
Only the cattle and spoil of that city Israel plundered to <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as:</i></font> themseves<Rf> themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which he commanded Joshua.
And Joshua will burn Ai and set it a heap forever, a waste even to this day.
And the king of Ai he hung upon the tree till the time of evening: and when the sun went down Joshua commanded and they will take down his carcass from the tree and cast it at the opening of the gate of the city, and they will set upon it a great heap of stones till this day.
Then Joshua will build an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel in mount Ebal.
As Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded the sons of Israel, as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of stones complete; which iron was not lifted up upon them: and they will bring up upon it burnt-offerings to Jehovah, and will sacrifice peace.
And he will write there upon the stones the second of the law of Moses which he wrote before the sons of Israel.
All Israel and his old men and scribes, and his judges stood hence, and thence, to the ark before the priests the Levites, lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, so the stranger as the native; half of them in front of mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded to bless the people of Israel in the beginning.
And after this he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all the writing in the book of the law.
There was not a word from all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the gathering of Israel, and the women and the little ones and the stranger going in the midst of them.
And it will be when all the kings hear which are on the other side Jordan, in the mountain and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and in front of Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite;
And they will gather together to fight with Joshua and with Israel with one mouth.
And the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua did to Jericho and to Ai.
And they will do in guile, and will go and will lay snares, and will take sacking worn out, for their asses, and leather sacks of wine worn out, and being rent and bound up;
And shoes worn out and mended, upon their feet, and garments worn out upon them; and all the bread of their food dry; it was crumbs.
And they will come to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and will say to him and to the men of Israel, From a land far off we came: and now cut out to us a covenant.
And the men of Israel will say to the Hivite, Perhaps thou shalt dwell in the midst of me, and I shall not make a covenant to thee.
And they will say to Joshua, We thy servants. And Joshua will say to them, Who are ye? and from whence will ye come?
And they will say to him, From a land very far off thy servants came, for the name of Jehovah thy God; for we heard his fame and all that he did in Egypt.
And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, in Ashtaroth.
And our old men and all the inhabitants of our land will say to us, saying, Take in your hand food for the way, and go to meet them, and say to them, We your servants: and now cut out to us a covenant:
This the hot bread we took it for food from our houses in the day we came forth to come to you; and now, behold, it dry, and it was crumbs.
And these leather sacks of wine which we filled, new, and behold, they were rent; and these our garments and our shoes worn out from the exceeding greatness of the way.
And the men will take of their food, and they asked not the mouth of Jehovah.
And Joshua will make peace to them, and will cut out to them a covenant to preserve them alive: and the chiefs of the assembly sware to them.
And it will be from the end of three days after they cut out a covenant to them, and they will hear that they are near to him, and they dwell in the midst of him.
And the sons of Israel will remove and will come to their cities in the third day. And their cities, Gibeon and Chephirah and Barith, and Kirjath-Jearim.
And the sons of Israel smote them not, for the chiefs of the assembly sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the assembly will murmur against the chiefs.
And all the chiefs will say to all the assembly, We sware to them by Jehovah the God of Israel: and now we shall not be able to touch upon them.
This we will do to them, and preserve them alive; and anger shall not be upon us for the oath that we sware to them.
And the chiefs will say to them, They shall live; and shall be cutting wood and drawing water to all the assembly as the chiefs spake to them.
And Joshua will call to them and will speak to them, saying, For what did ye deceive us, saying, We are very far from you? and ye dwell in the midst of us.
And now ye are cursed, and there shall not be cut off from you to serve, and hewing wood and drawing water for the house of my God.
And they will answer Joshua, and will say, Because being announced, it was announced to thy servants that Jehovah thy God commanded Moses his servant to give to you all the land, and to destroy all inhabiting the land from before you, and we shall be greatly afraid for our souls from your face; and we shall do this word.
And now, behold us in thy hand: as is good and as is right in your eyes to do to us, do.
And he will do so to them, and he will deliver them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they slew them not.
And Joshua will give them in that day hewing wood and drawing water for the assembly and for the altar of Jehovah till this day, to the place which he shall choose.
And it will be lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua took Ai and exterminated it; as he did to Jericho and to her king, so he did to Ai and her king; and that the inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel, and they will be in the midst of them.
And they will fear greatly, for a great city was Gibeon, as one of the cities of the kingdom, and that it was great above Ai, and all her men mighty.
And lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, will send to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
Come up to me and help me, and we will smite Gibeon, because she made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.
And the five kings of the Amorites will be gathered together and will come up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all their camps, and they will encamp against Gibeon, and they will war against her.
And the men of Gibeon will send to Joshua to the camp of Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites inhabiting the mountain gathered themselves together against us.
And Joshua will come up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty of strength.
And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not be afraid of them, for into thy hands I gave them; a man of them shall not stand before thee.
And Joshua will come to them suddenly, all night he went up from Gilgal.
And Jehovah will discomfit them before Israel, and will strike them a great blow in Gibeon, and will pursue them the way of the ascent of the house of Horon, and he will strike them even to Azekah and even to Makkedah.
And it will be in their fleeing from before Israel, they in the descent of the house of Horon, and Jehovah cast down upon them great stones from the heavens, even to Azekah; and more will die who died by the stones of hail than whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.
Then will Joshua speak to Jehovah in the day Jehovah will give the Amorite before the sons of Israel, and he will say before the eyes of Israel, Sun in Gibeon, be thou silent, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
And the sun will be silent, and the moon stood, till the people will be avenged upon its enemies. Is it not written upon the book of the upright? and the sun will stand in the half of the heavens, and it hasted not to go down for a whole day.
And there was not as that day, before it and after it, that Jehovah heard to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.
And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to the camp of Gilgal.
And these five kings will flee and will hide in a cave in Makkedah.
And it will be announced to Joshua, saying, The five kings were found hid in a cave in Makkedah.
And Joshua will say, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to watch them.
And ye shall not stand; pursue after your enemies; cut off the rear of them; ye shall not give them to come in to their cities, for Jehovah your God gave them into your hand.
And it will be when Joshua finished, and the sons of Israel, smiting them an exceeding great blow till he finished them, and they escaping, escaped from them and they will go to the fortified cities.
And all the people will turn back to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: and none sharpened his tongue against a man to the sons of Israel.
And Joshua will say, Open the mouth of the cave and bring forth to me these five kings out of the cave.
And they will do so, and will bring forth to him these five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
And it will be when they brought these kings forth to Joshua, and Joshua will call to every man of Israel, and will say to the leaders of the men of war having gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they will come near and put their feet upon their necks.
And Joshua will say to them, Ye shall not fear and ye shall not be dismayed; be strong and be active, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies whom ye war against them.
And Joshua will smite them after this, and will kill them, and hang them upon five trees: and they will be hanging upon the trees till evening.
And it will be at the time of the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they will take them down from the trees and cast them into the cave where they were hid there; and they will put great stones upon the mouth of the cave till this self-same day.
And Joshua took Makkedah in that day, and he will smite her with the mouth of the sword; and her king he exterminated, them, and every soul which was in her; none was left escaping: and he will do to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
And Joshua will pass by and all Israel with him from Makkedah to Libnah, and will fight with Libnah.
And Jehovah will also give it into the hand of Israel, and her king: and he will smite it with the mouth of the sword and every soul which is in it; none was left in it escaping; and he will do to her king as he did to the king of Jericho.

See, I cast to you in lot these nations having been left in inheritance to your tribes from Jordan, and all the nations which I cut off, and the great, sea, from the going down of the sun.

So as not to come among these nations, these being left with you; and ye shall not make mention of the name of their gods, and ye shall not swear, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not worship to them:

For if turning back, ye shall turn back and cleave to the remainder of these nations, these being left with you, and marry with them, and go in to them, and they in to you,
Knowing, ye shall know that Jehovah your God will not add to drive out these nations from before you: and they, were to you for a snare and for a noose, and for a scourge in your sides, and for thorns in your eyes, till your destruction from this good land which Jehovah your God gave to you.
And behold, I go this day in the way of all the earth; and ye knew in all your heart and in all your soul that not one word fell from all the good words which Jehovah your God spake concerning you; all came to you; not one word fell from it.

And the man will go up to the land of the Hittites, and he will build a city and call its name Luz; this its name till this day.
And Manasseh did not drive out the House of Rest and her daughters, and Tanach and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Dor and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Ibleam and her daughters, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her daughters; and the Canaanite wills to dwell in that land.
And it will be when Israel was strong, and he will put the Canaanite to tribute; and driving out, they did not drive out.
And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanite dwelling in Gezer; and the Canaanite dwelt in his midst in Gezer.
Zebulon did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, and the inhabitants of Nahalol; and the Canaanite will dwell in his midst, and they will be for tribute.
Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Accho, and the inhabitants of Zidon and Ahlab and Achzib and Helbah, and Aphik, and Rehob:
And the Asherite dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they drove not out.
Naphtali drove not out the inhabitants of the House of the Sun, and the inhabitants of the House of Affliction; and he dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of the House of the Sun, and of the House of Response, they were to them for tribute.
And the Amorites will press the sons of Dan to the mountain: for they gave not to come down to the valley:
And the Amorite willed to dwell in mount Heres and in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: and the hand of the house of Joseph will be heavy, and they will be for tribute.
And the bound of the Amorite from the ascent of Akrabbim from the rock, and above.
And a messenger of Jehovah will go up from Gilgal to Bochim, and he will say, I will bring you up out of Egypt, and I will bring you in to the land which I sware to your fathers; and he said I will not break my covenant with you forever.
And ye shall not cut out a covenant to the inhabitants of this land; their altars ye shall break down: and ye heard not to my voice: why did ye this?
And I also said, I will not drive them out from your face; and they were to you for adversaries, and their gods shall be to you for a snare.
And it will be when the messenger of Jehovah spake these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people will lift up their voice and weep.
And they will call the name of that place Bochim: and they will sacrifice there to Jehovah.
And Joshua will send away the people, and the sons of Israel will go a man to his inheritance to inherit the land.
And the people will serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the old men who prolonged the days after Joshua, who saw all the great works of Jehovah which he did to Israel.
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, will die, the son of a hundred and ten years.
And they will bury him in the bound of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, in mount Ephraim, from the north to the mount of Gaash.
And also all that generation were gathered to its fathers; and another generation will arise after them not knowing Jehovah, and also the works which he did to Israel.
And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and will serve the Baalims.
And they will forsake Jehovah the God of their fathers bringing them out of the land of Egypt, and go after other gods from the gods of the peoples which are round about them, and they will worship to them and provoke Jehovah.
And they will forsake Jehovah, and will serve Baal and Ashtaroth.
And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will give them into the hand of plunderers, and they will plunder them; and he will sell them into the hand of their enemies from round about, and they will no more be able to stand before the face of their enemies.
In all where they will go forth, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah spake and as Jehovah sware to them: and he will press them greatly.
And Jehovah will raise up judges, and they will save them from the hand of their plunderers.
And also they will not hear to their judges, for they committed fornications after other gods, and they will worship to them: they turned aside quickly from the way which their fathers went to hear the commands of Jehovah; they did not so.
And when Jehovah raised up to them judges, and Jehovah was with the judge, and saved them from the hand of their enemies all of the days of the judge: for Jehovah will grieve from their groaning from the face of those pressing them and thrusting them.
And it was in the dying of the judge, they will turn back and be corrupted above their fathers to go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them: they let nothing fall from their deeds and from their hard way.
And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel; and he will say, Because that this nation passed by my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and heard not to my voice,
I also will not add to drive out a man from their face from the nations which Joshua left, and he died,
So as to try Israel by them, whether they are watching the way of Jehovah to go in them, as their fathers watched, or not.
And Jehovah will leave these nations, not to drive them out quickly, and he gave them not into the hand of Joshua.
These the nations which Jehovah left to try Israel by them, (all which knew not the wars of Canaan;
Only for the generations of the sons of Israel to know to teach them war, only who before knew not;)
Five princes of Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivite dwelling in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon.
And they will be to try Israel by them to know whether they will hear the commands of Jehovah which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
And the sons of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
And they will take their daughters to them for wives, and their daughters they will give to their sons, and they will serve their gods.
And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will forget Jehovah their God, and they will serve the Baalims and the wooden pillars.
And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will sell them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram-Naharim: and the sons of Israel will serve Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.
And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will raise up a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he will save them, Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother younger than he.
And the spirit of Jehovah will be upon him, and he will judge Israel, and he will go forth to war: and Jehovah will give into his hand Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram; and his hand will be strong upon Cushan-Rishathaim.
And the land will rest forty years: and Othniel, son of Kenaz, will die.
And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah: and Jehovah will strengthen Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel, because they did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And he will gather to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he will go and smite Israel, and will inherit the city of palm-trees.
And the sons of Israel will serve Eglon, king of Moab, eighteen years.
And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will raise up to them a saviour, Ehud, son of Gera, son of a Benjamite, a man shut up of his right hand: and the sons of Israel will send a gift by his hand to Eglon, king of Moab.
And Ehud will make to him a sword, and to it two mouths; a cubit its length: and he will gird it from under his garments upon his right thigh.
And he will bring the gift to Eglon, king of Moab: and Eglon a very fat man.
And it will be as he finished to bring the gift, and he will send away the people lifting up the gift.
And he turned back from the carved images which were at Gilgal, and he will say, A hidden word to me for thee, O king: and he will say, Silence! And all standing by him will go forth from him.
And Ehud came to him; and he sat in an upper chamber of cooling, which was to him alone: and Ehud will say, A word of God to me for thee. And he will rise from off the throne.
And Ehud will stretch forth his left hand, and will take the sword from off his right thigh, and he will drive it into his belly:
And the handle will also go in after the flame, and the fat will shut upon the flame, for he drew not the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
And Ehud will come forth to the portico, and he will shut the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and fasten.
And he went forth, and his servants came in, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber were fastened; and they will say, Surely he is covering his feet in the chamber of cooling.
And they will delay till being ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the upper chamber; and they will take a key and will open: and behold, their lord fallen upon the earth, dead.
And Ehud was saved during their consternation; and he passed by the carved images and will be saved at the gates.
And it will be in his coming out, and he will clang upon the trumpet in mount Ephraim, and the sons of Israel will go down with him from the mountain, and he before them.
And he will say to them, Follow after me, for Jehovah gave your enemies, Moab, into your hand. And they will go down after him and will take the passages of Jordan toward Moab, and they gave not a man to pass over.
And they will smite Moab in that time, about ten thousand men, every one fat and every man strong: and not a man was saved.
And Moab will be subdued in that day under the hand of Israel: and the land will rest eighty years.
And after him was Shamgar, son of Anath; and he will smite the Philistines, six hundred men with an oxgoad; and he also will deliver Israel.
And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Ehud died.
And Jehovah will sell them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his army, Sisera; and he will dwell in Harosheth of the nations:
And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah; for nine hundred chariots of iron to him; and he pressed the sons of Israel by force twenty years.
And Deborah, a woman, a prophetess, wife to Lapidoth, she judged Israel in that time.
And she will dwell under the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and between Bethel, in mount Ephraim: and the sons of Israel will go up to her for judgment.
And she will send and call for Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kadesh Naphtali; and she will say to him, Did not Jehovah the God of Israel command, Go, and draw into mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men from the sons of Naphtali and from the sons of Zebulon?
And I drew to thee to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude; and I gave him into thy hand.
And Barak will say to her, If thou wilt go with me, and I will go: and if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.
And she will say, Going, I will go with thee: but yet it shall not be thine honor upon the way which thou goest; for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah will rise and will go with Barak to Kadesh.
And Barak will cry out to Zebulon and Naphtali to Kadesh; and he will go up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah will go up with him.
And Heber the Kenite separated himself from Kain, from the sons of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses, and he will stretch out his tent even to the oak in Zaanaim which is at Kadesh.
And they will announce to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam, went up to mount Tabor.
And Sisera will call together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people which are with him from Harosheth of the nations, to the torrent of Kishon.
And Deborah will say to Barak, Arise; for this is the day which Jehovah gave Sisera into thine hand; went not Jehovah out before thee? and Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
And Jehovah will discomfit Sisera and all the chariots and all the camp, with the mouth of the sword before Barak; and Sisera will descend from the chariot, and will flee on his feet.
And Barak pursued after the chariots and after the camp, even to Harosheth of the nations: and all the camp of Sisera will fall by the mouth of the sword; there was not left even one.
And Sisera fled upon his feet to the tent of Jael, wife of Heber, the Kenite: for peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
And Jael will go forth to meet Sisera, and will say to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; thou shalt not be afraid. And he will turn aside to her to the tent, and she will cover him with a carpet.
And he will say to her, Give me to drink now a little water, for I thirsted. And she will open a sack of milk, and will give him drink, and will cover him.
And he will say to her, stand at the door of the tent, and it was when a man shall come, and ask thee and say, Is a man here? and say thou, No.
And Jael, Heber's wife, will take a peg of the tent, and will put a hammer in her hand, and will go to him softly, and will drive the peg into his temples, and it will go down into the earth; and he was in a deep sleep and was wearied. And he will die.
And behold, Barak pursued Sisera, and Jael will come up to meet him, and she will say to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest And he will go in to her, and behold, Sisera fallen dead, and the peg in his temples.
And God will subdue in that day, Jabin, king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.
And the hand of the sons of Israel, going, will go, and be hard upon Jabin, king of Canaan, till they cut off Jabin, king of Canaan.
And Deborah will sing, and Barak, son of Abinoam, in that day, saying,
In the leading on of the leaders in Israel, In the willingness of the people, praise ye Jehovah.
Hear, ye kings; give ear ye princes; I, to Jehovah, will I sing; I will play to Jehovah, God of Israel.
Jehovah, in thy going forth from Seir, In thy ascending from the field of Edom, The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, Also the clouds dropped water.
The mountains flowed from before Jehovah, This Sinai from before Jehovah, the God of Israel.
In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, In the days of Jael, they left the ways; They went the by-ways; they will go the winding ways.
The rulers ceased in Israel: they ceased Till I, Deborah, arose: I arose a mother in Israel.
He will choose new gods; Then war in the gates: If a shield was seen, and a lance, Among forty thousand in Israel.
My heart to the leaders of Israel, Those giving voluntarily among the people: Praise ye Jehovah.
Ye riding upon white asses, Sitting upon jurisdiction, And going upon the way, speak ye.
From the voice of arrows between the watering-troughs, There will they give the justices of Jehovah, The justices of his rule in Israel: Then will the people of Jehovah go down to the gates.
Awake, awake! Deborah; Awake, awake! speak a song: Arise, Barak, and lead captive, thy captivity, son of Abinoam.
Then the one left shall go down to the chiefs of the people: Jehovah will come down to me among the mighty.
The fate of Ephraim uprooted them in Amalek; After thee, Benjamin, among thy tribes; From Machir the lawgivers came down, And from Zebulon they drawing with the rod of the scribe.
And the chiefs in Issachar with Deborah; And Issachar, so Barak: In the valley sent he, upon his feet. In the divisions of Reuben, Great decrees of heart.
Wherefore didst thou dwell in the midst of the folds, To hear the pipings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben, great searching's of heart.
In Gilead beyond Jordan he dwelt; And Dan, wherefore will he sojourn in ships? Asher will dwell by the shore of the seas, And upon his harbors will he dwell.
Zebulon a people reproached his soul to death, And Naphtali upon the heights of the field.
Kings came: they fought: Then fought the kings of Canaan, Tanach, upon the water of Megiddo: Plunder of silver took they not.
From the heavens they fought; The stars from their raised ways fought with Sisera.
The torrent Kishon snatched them away The torrent of ancient days, the torrent of Kishon. Thou wilt tread down strength, O my soul.
Then were the horse heels smitten From the courses, the courses of his strong ones.
Curse ye Meroz, said the messenger of Jehovah: Cursing, curse ye her inhabitants; For they came not to the help of Jehovah To the help of Jehovah against the mighty ones.
Blessed shall be Jael above women, The wife of Heber the Kenite, Above women in the tent shall she be blessed.
He asked water, she gave milk; In a prince's dish brought she curdled milk.
Her hand to the peg will she stretch forth, And her right hand to the hammer of labor, And she struck Sisera; she smote through his head, And she crushed and pierced through his temples.
Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell: Where he bowed, there he fell, destroyed.
Through the window she looked forth and cried out, The mother of Sisera, through the lattice Why did his chariot delay to come? Why lingered the paces of his chariots?
Her wise chiefs will answer, Surely, will she turn back words to herself,
Will they not find? They will divide the spoil; He compassionated compassions to head of man; The spoil of dyed garments to Sisera, A spoil of dyed garments of variegation, Dyed of double variegation for the necks of the spoil.
So shall all thine enemies perish, O Jehovah: And those loving him, as the going forth of the sun in his strength. And the land will rest forty years.
And the sons of Israel will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah will give them into the hand of Midian seven years.
And the hand of Midian will be strong upon Israel: from the face of Midian the sons of Israel made to them clefts which are in the mountains, and caves and fastnesses.
And it was if Israel sowed, and Midian came up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east, and they came up against him:
And they will encamp against them, and they will destroy the produce of the land even to thy coming to Gaza; and they will not leave means of life in Israel, and sheep and ox and ass.
For they and their cattle will come up, and their tents will come, as an abundance of locusts for multitude; and to them and to their camels no number: and they will come into the land to destroy it.
And Israel will be enfeebled from the face of Midian; and the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah.
And it will be when the sons of Israel cried to Jehovah on account of Midian,
And Jehovah will send forth a man, a prophet, to the sons of Israel, and he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and I will bring you out of the house of servants;
And I will deliver you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of all pressing you, and I will drive them out from your face, and I will give to you their land;
And saying to you, I am Jehovah your God; ye shall not fear the Gods of the Amorites which ye will dwell in their land: and ye heard not to my voice.
And a messenger of Jehovah will come and sit under an oak which is in Ophrah, which is to Joash, father of Ezri: and Gideon his son threshed wheat in the wine press to place in safety from the face of Midian.
And the messenger of Jehovah will be seen to him, and he will say to him, Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty of strength.
And Gideon will say to him With leave, my Lord, and Jehovah be; with us, and wherefore did all this find us? and where all his wonderful things which our fathers recounted to us, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up out of Egypt? and now Jehovah cast us off, and he will give us into the hand of Midian.
And Jehovah will turn to him and say, Go in this thy strength and save Israel from the hand of Midian: did I not send thee?
And he will say to him, With leave, my Lord, by what shall I save Israel? behold, my thousand destitute in Manasseh, and I the least in my father's house.
And Jehovah will say to him, For I will be with thee, and strike thou Midian as one man.
And he will say to him, If now I found grace in thine eyes, and do to me a sign that thou speakest with me.
Now thou shalt not depart from here till my coming to thee, and I brought forth my gift and set it before thee. And he will say, I will remain till thy turning back.
And Gideon went in, and he will do a kid of the goats, and an ephah of flour of unleavened: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and he will bring forth to him under the oak and will bring near.
And the messenger of God will say to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened and lay upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he will do so.
And the messenger of Jehovah will stretch forth the extremity of the staff which in his hand, and will touch upon the flesh and on the unleavened; and fire will rise up from the rock and will consume the flesh and the unleavened. And the messenger of Jehovah went from his eyes.
And Gideon will see that he a messenger of Jehovah; and Gideon will say, Ah, Lord Jehovah! for on account that I saw a messenger of Jehovah face to face.
And Jehovah will say to him, Peace to thee; thou shalt not fear; thou shalt not die.
And Gideon will build there an altar to Jehovah, and he will call to him Jehovah-peace: till this day and it yet in Ophrah of the father of Edrei.
And it will be in that night Jehovah will say to him, Take a bullock of the oxen which is to thy father, and the second bullock of seven years, and break in pieces the altar of Baal, which is to thy father, and the wooden pillar which is upon it thou shalt cut down;
And build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the head of this strong place, in order, and take the second bullock and bring up a burnt-offering upon the wood of the wooden pillar which thou shalt cut down.
And Gideon will take ten men of his servants, and he will do as Jehovah spake to him: and it will be as he will fear the house of his father and the men of the city doing in the day, and he will do in the night.
And the men of the city will rise early in the morning, and behold, the altar of Baal thrown down, and the wooden pillar which is upon it cut down, and the second bullock brought up upon the altar having been built.
And they will say a man to his neighbor, Who did this word? And they will enquire and search, and they will say, Gideon, son of Joash did this word.
And the men of the city will say to Joash, Bring forth thy son and he shall die: for he threw down the altar of Baal, and because he cut down the wooden pillar which is upon it.
And Joash will say to all who stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? whoever will contend for him shall die during the morning: if he is a god he will be mighty for himself, for he threw down his altar.
And he will call to him in that day, Baal will be powerful, saying, Baal will be mighty against him because he threw down his altar.
And all Midian and Amalek, and the sons of the east were gathered together, and they will pass over and they will encamp in the valley of Jezreel.
And the spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon, and he will strike upon the trumpet; and Abiezer will be called after him.
And he sent messengers in all Manasseh; and he also will be called after him: and he sent messengers in Asher, and in Zebulon, and in Naphtali; and they will come up to meet them.
And Gideon will say to God, If thou art saving Israel by my hand, as thou spakest,
Behold me putting a fleece of wool in the threshing-floor, and if the dew shall be upon the fleece only, and upon all the earth dryness, and I knew that thou wilt save Israel by my hand as thou spakest.
And it will be so: and he will rise early upon the morrow, and he will press the fleece together, and the dew will press out from the fleece, a bowl full of water.
And Gideon will say to God, Thine anger will not kindle against me, and I will speak but this once: I will try now only this once upon the fleece; there shall be dryness to the fleece alone, and upon all the earth shall be dew.
And God will do so in that night: and there will be dryness to the fleece only, and upon all the earth was dew.
And Jerub-Baal (he is Gideon) will rise early and all the people that is with him, and they will encamp by the fountain of Harod: and the camp of Midian was to him from the north from the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
And Jehovah will say to Gideon, The people many which are with thee for me to give Midian into their hand, lest Israel shall glory before me, saying, My hand saved me.
And now, call now in the ears of the people, saying, Who being afraid and trembling shall turn back and turn about from mount Gilead. And there will turn back from the people twenty and two thousand; and ten thousand were left.
And Jehovah will say to Gideon, Yet the people many; bring them down to the waters, and I will purify them for thee there; and it shall be of whom saying to thee, This shall go with thee, he shall go with thee; and all which saying to thee, This shall not go with thee, he shall not go.
And he will bring down the people to the waters: and Jehovah will say to Gideon, Every one which shall lap with his tongue from the waters as the dog will lap, thou shalt put him alone; and all which shall bend upon his knees to drink.
And the number of those lapping with their hand to their mouth, will be three hundred men: and all the remainder of the people bowed upon their knees to drink water.
And Jehovah will say to Gideon, By the three hundred men lapping, I will save you, and give Midian into thy hand: and all the people shall go, a man to his place.
And the people will take food in their hand and their trumpets: and he sent all the men of Israel a man to his tent, and by the three hundred men he was strengthened: and the camp of Midian was to him beneath in the valley.
And it will be in that night, and Jehovah will say to him, Arise, go down to the camp, for I gave him into thy hand.
And if thou shalt fear to go down go down thou and Phurah thy youth to the camp:
And thou heardest what they shall speak: and afterward thy hands shall be strengthened, and go down to the camp. And he will go down, he and Phurah his boy to the extremity of the brave which in the camp.
And Midain and Amalek, and all the sons of the east, encamping in the valley, as the locust for multitude; and to their camels no number, as the sand which is upon the lip of the sea for multitude.
And Gideon will come, and behold, a man recounting a dream to his neighbor; and he will say, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a round cake of barley bread rolling into the camp of Midian; and it will come even to the tent, and it will strike it, and it will fall and will turn it over, so that the tent fell.
And his neighbor will answer and say, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, son of Joash, a man of Israel: God gave into his hand Midian, and all the camp.
And it will be when Gideon heard the recounting of the dream and its breaking, and he will worship, and turn back to the camp of Israel, and he will say, Arise, ye, for Jehovah gave into your hand the camp of Midian.
And he will divide the three hundred men into three beginnings, and he will give trumpets into the hand of them all, and empty buckets, and torches in the midst of the buckets.
And he will say to them, Ye shall look upon me, and so shall ye do: and behold me coming to the extremity of the camp, and it was as I shall do, so ye shall do.
And I struck upon the trumpet, I and all that are with me, and ye struck upon the trumpets, also ye round about all the camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon.
And Gideon will go and the hundred men that are with him, to the extremity of the, camp, the beginning of the middle watch; only now rising up they raised up those watching: and they will strike upon the trumpets, and they brake the buckets that are in their hand.
And the three heads will strike upon the trumpets, and will break the buckets, and they will hold fast in their left hand upon the torches, and in their right hand the trumpets to strike: and they will call the sword for Jehovah and for Gideon.
And they will stand a man for himself round about the camp; and all the camp will run and cry out and flee.
And the three hundred will clang the trumpets, and Jehovah will set the sword of a man against his neighbor and in all the camp: and the camp fled even to the House of Acacia of Zererath, even to the lip of Abel-Meholah, to Tabbath.
And a man of Israel will be called from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from Manasseh, and they will pursue after Midian.
And Gideon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down to meet Midian, and take before them the waters even to the House of Passage, and Jordan. And every man of Ephraim will be called together, and they will take the waters even to the House of Passage and Jordan.
And they will take the two chiefs of Midian. Oreb and Zeeb; and they will kill Oreb upon the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, and they pursued against Midian, and the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they brought to Gideon beyond Jordan.
And the men of Ephraim will say to him, Why didst thou this word to us, that thou calledst not to us when thou wentest to war against Midian? and they will contend with him with strength.
And he will say to them, What now did I according to you? are not the gleanings of Ephraim good above the vintage of Abi-Ezer?
Into your hand God gave the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do according to you? Then was their spirit relaxed from over him in his speaking this word.
And Gideon will come to Jordan to pass through, he and the three hundred men that are with him, faint and pursuing.
And he will say to the men of Succoth, Ye shall give now rounds of bread to the people who are at my feet: for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
And the chiefs of Succoth will say, Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that bread was given to thine army?
And Gideon will say, For this in Jehovah's giving Zebah and Zalmunna into my band, and I threshed your flesh with thorns of the desert and threshing-sledges.
And he will go up from thence to Penuel, and he will say to them like this: and the men of Penuel will answer him as the men of Succoth answered.
And he will say also to the men of Penuel, saying, In my turning back in peace I will break down this tower.
And Zebah and Zalmunna are in Karkor, and their camps with them, about fifteen thousand, all those remaining from all the camp of the sons of the east: and there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men drawing the sword.
And Gideon will go up the way of those dwelling in tents from the east to Nobah and Jogbehah, and he will smite the camp; and the camp was secure.
And Zebah and Zalmunna will flee, and he will pursue after them and he will take the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna, and he terrified all the camp.
And Gideon son of Joash, will turn back from the war from the cliff of the sun.
And he will take a youth from the men of Succoth, and he will ask him: and he will write for him the chiefs of Succoth and its old men, seventy and seven men.
And he will come to the men of Succoth, and he will say, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the hand of Zebah and. Zalmunna now in thine hand to give bread to thy men being weary?
And he will take the old men of the city, and thorns of the desert, and threshing sledges, and with them he caused the men of Succoth to know.
And he brake down the tower of Penuel, and he will kill the men of the city.
And he will say to Zebah and Zalmunna, Whose the men which ye killed in Tabor? and they will say, As thou, so they; one according to the form of the sons of the king.
And he will say, My brethren, the sons of my mother: Jehovah lives, would that ye preserved them alive, and I had not slain you.
And he will say to Jether his first-born, Arise, kill them. But the youth drew not his sword, for he was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
And Zebah will say, and Zalmunna, Arise, and fall upon us: for as a man, his strength. And Gideon will rise and kill Zebah and Zalmunna, and he will take the little moons upon their camels' necks.
And the men of Israel will say to Gideon, Rule over us, also thou, also thy son, also thy son's son: for thou savedst us from the hand of Midian.
And Gideon will say to them, I will not rule over you, and my son shall not rule over you: Jehovah shall rule over you.
And Gideon will say to them, I will ask of you an asking, and ye shall give to me a man the rings of his spoil: for gold rings to them, because they were Ishmaelites.
And they will say, Giving, we will give. And they will spread a garment, and they will cast there each the rings of his spoil.
And the weight of the gold rings which he asked will be a thousand and seven hundred of gold; besides of little moons and earrings and purple robes which were upon the kings of Midian, and besides from the collars which upon their camels' necks.
And Gideon will make it into an ephod, and he will put in his city, Ophrah: and all Israel will commit fornication after it there: and it will be to Gideon and to his house for a snare.
And Midian will be subdued before the sons of Israel, and they will not add to lift up their head: and the land will rest forty years in the days of Gideon.
And Jerubbaal, son of Joash, will go and dwell in his house.
And to Gideon were seventy sons going out of his thigh: for many women were to him.
And his concubine which is in Shechem, she will bear to him a son, and she will set his name Abimelech.
And Gideon will die in a good old age, and he will be buried in the grave of Joash his father, in Ophrah, of the father of Ezri.
And it will be when Gideon died the sons of Israel will turn back, and will commit fornication after the Baalims, and they will set to them Baal of the covenant for their god.
And the sons of Israel did not remember Jehovah their God, delivering them out of the hand of all their enemies from round about.
And they did not kindness with the house of Jerubbaal, Gideon, according to all the good which he did with Israel.
And Abimelech son of Jerubbaal, will come to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and say to them, to all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
Speak, now, in the ears of all the lords of Shechem, What good to you for seventy men of all the sons of Jerubbaal to rule over you, or one man to rule over you? and remember that I am your bone and your flesh.
And his mother's brethren will speak concerning him in the ears of all the lords of Shechem all these words: and their heart will incline after Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
And they will give him seventy of silver from the house of Baal of the covenant, and Abimelech will hire with them men empty and vain-glorious, and they will go after him.
And he will come to his father's house at Ophrah, and will kill his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men upon one stone: and Jotham the young son of Jerubbaal will be left, for he was hid.
And all the lords of Shechem will gather together, and all the House of the Rampart, and they will make Abimelech king, by the Oak of the Pillar which is in Shechem.
And they will announce to Jotham and he will go and stand upon the head of mount Gerizim, and he will lift up his voice and call, and say to them, Hear to me, ye lords of Shechem, and God will hear to you.
The trees going forth went to anoint over them a king; and they will say to the olive, Reign thou over us.
And the olive will say to them, Left I my fatness which by me they will honor God and men, and went I to wander about over the trees?
And the trees will say to the fig tree, Come thou, reign over us.
And the fig tree will say to them, Left I my sweetness, and my good produce, and went I to wander about over the trees?
And the trees will say to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
And the vine will say to them, Left I my new wine-making, rejoicing God and men, and went I to wander about over the trees?
And all the trees will say to the buckthorn. Come thou, reign over us.
And the buckthorn will say to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me for king over you, come, take refuge in my shadow: and if not, fire shall come forth from the buckthorn and shall consume the cedars of Lebanon.
And now if in truth and in uprightness ye did and ye shall make Abimelech king, and if ye did good with Jerubbaal and with his house, and if according to the desert of his hands ye did to him:
(For my father fought for you, and he will cast his soul away, and he will deliver you from the hand of Midian.
And ye rose up against the house of my father this day, and ye will kill his sons, seventy men, upon one stone; and ye will make Abimelech, son of his maid, king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your brother:)
And if in sincerity and uprightness ye did with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice ye in Abimelech, and he shall rejoice also in you.
And if not, fire shall come forth from Abimelech and shall consume the lords of Shechem and the House of the Rampart; and fire shall come forth from the lords of Shechem and from the House of the Rampart, and shall consume Abimelech.
And Jotham will flee, and break away, and he will go to the well and will dwell there from the face of Abimelech his brother.
And Abimelech will have dominion over Israel three years,
And God will send an evil spirit between Abimelech and between the lords of Shechem; and the lords of Shechem will act deceitfully with Abimelech,
To bring the wrong of the seventy sons of Jerubbaal and to put their blood upon Abimelech their brother who killed them, and upon the lords of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brethren.
And the lords of Shechem will set for him liers in wait upon the heads of the mountains, and they will rob all who shall pass over by them in the way: and it was announced to Abimelech.
And Gaal son of Ebed will come, and his brethren, and they will pass over to Shechem: and the lords of Shechem will trust in him.
And they will go forth to the field, and they will gather their vineyards, and they will tread down, and they will make rejoicings, and go in to the house of their God, and they will eat and drink, and curse Abimelech.
And Gaal son of Ebed will say, Who Abimelech, and who Shechem, that we shall serve him? is he not the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his overseer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: and why shall we serve him?
And who will give this people into my hand? And I will remove Abimelech. And he will say to Abimelech, Increase thine army and come forth.
And Zebul the ruler of the city will hear the words of Gaal, son of Ebed, and his wrath will kindle.
And he will send messengers to Abimelech in deceit, saying, Behold, Gaal son of Ebed, and his brethren, came to Shechem; and behold, they pressed the city against thee.
And now, rise up by night, thou and the people which are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
And it was in the morning when the sun rose, thou shalt rise early and invade upon the city: and behold, he and the people which with him coming forth against thee; and do thou to him as thy hand shall find.
And Abimelech will rise, and all the people which are with him, by night, and they will lie in wait against Shechem in four heads.
And Gaal son of Ebed will go forth, and he will stand at the door of the gate of the city: and Abimelech will rise, and the people that are with him, from the ambush.
And Gaal will see the people, and he will say to Zebul, Behold, people coming down from the heads of the mountains. And Zebul will say to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men.
And Gaal will add to speak, and will say, Behold, people coming down from the height of the land, and one head coming from the way of the oak of Meonenim.
And Zebul will say to him, Where now thy mouth with which thou wilt say, Who Abimelech, that we shall serve him? is not this the people which thou despised it? now go forth now, and fight with it.
And Gaal will go forth before the lords of Shechem, and he will fight against Abimelech.
And Abimelech will pursue him and he will flee from his face, and many will fall wounded at the door of the gate.
And Abimelech will dwell in Arumah: and Zebul will drive out Gaal and his brethren from dwelling in Shechem.
And it will be from the morrow, and the people will go forth to the field; and they will announce to Abimelech.
And he will take the people and will divide them into three heads, and he will lie in wait in the field, and he will see, and behold, the people will come forth from the city, and he will rise up against them and smite them.
And Abimelech and the heads which are with him will invade, and they will stand at the door of the gate of the city: and two heads will invade upon all which are in the field, and they will smite them.
And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he will take the city, and the people which in it he killed, and he will tear down the city, and will sow it with salt.
And all the lords of the tower of Shechem will hear, and they will go in to the tower of the god of the covenant.
And it was announced to Abimelech that all the lords of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
And Abimelech will go up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that with him; and Abimelech will take axes in his hand, and he will cut boughs of the trees, and will lift up and will put upon his shoulder, and he will say to the people which are with him, What ye saw I did, hasten, do like me.
And also all the people will cut each a bough, and will go after Abimelech, and they will put upon the tower, and will set the tower on fire upon them, and all the men of the tower of Shechem will die; about a thousand men and women.
And Abimelech will go to Thebez, and he will encamp against Thebez and take it.
And a strong tower was in the midst of the city, and thither will flee all the men and women and all the lords of the city, and will shut up from after them, and they will go up upon the roof of the tower.
And Abimelech will come even to the tower, and will fight against it, and will urge on, even to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
And one woman will cast a piece of the upper mill-stone upon the head of Abimelech, and she will break his skull.
And he will call quickly to the youth lifting up his weapons, and he will say to him, Draw thy sword and put me to death, lest they shall say of me, A woman killed him. And his youth will thrust him through and he will die.
And the men of Israel will see that Abimelech died, and they will go each to his place.
And God will turn back the evil of Abimelech which he did to his father for killing his seventy brethren.
And all the evil of the men of Shechem God turned back upon their head: and against them will come the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
And after Abimelech will rise to save Israel, Tola, the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir, in mount Ephraim.
And he will judge Israel twenty and three years; and he will die and be buried in Shamir.
And after him will rise Jair the Gileadite, and he will judge Israel twenty and two years.
And to him will be thirty sons riding upon thirty young asses, and thirty cities to them; and they will call them the villages of Jair even to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
And Jair will die and be buried in Canon.
And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will serve the Baalims, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of Philisteim; and they will forsake Jehovah and not serve.
And the wrath of Jehovah will kindle against Israel, and he will sell them into the hand of Philisteim, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon.
And they will oppress and break down the sons of Israel in that year, eighteen years, all the sons of Israel that are beyond Jordan in the land of the Amorite which is in Gilead.
And the sons of Ammon will pan over Jordan to war also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim: and it will press upon Israel greatly.
And the sons of Israel will cry to Jehovah, saying, We sinned against thee because we forsook our God, and we shall serve the Baalims.
And Jehovah will say to the sons of Israel, Was it not out of Egypt, and from the Amorite, and from the sons of Ammon and from Philisteim?
And the Zidonians and Amalek, and Maon pressed you; and ye will cry to me, and I will save you from their hand.
And ye forsook me, and ye will serve other gods: wherefore I will not add to save you.
Go and cry to the gods, which ye chose among them; they shall save for you in time of your straits.
And the sons of Israel will say to Jehovah, We sinned: do thou to us according to all the good in thine eyes; but deliver us now, this day.
And they will remove the strange gods from the midst of them, and they will serve Jehovah: and his soul will be shortened for the labor of Israel.
And the sons of Ammon will be called together, and they will encamp in Gilead. And the sons of Israel will assemble together and encamp in Mizpeh.
And the people, the chiefs of Gilead, will say, a man to his neighbor, Who the man that will begin to war against the sons of Ammon? he shall be for head to all those dwelling in Gilead.
And Jephthah the Gileadite was a man of strength, and he the son of a woman, a harlot And Gilead will beget Jephthah.
And Gilead's wife will bring forth sons to him, and his wife's sons will grow, and they will drive out Jephthah, and they will say to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house, for thou the son of another woman.
And Jephthah will flee from the face of his brethren and will dwell in the land of Tob: and empty men will gather together to Jephthah and will go forth with him.
And it will be from days and the sons of Ammon will war with Israel.
And it will be when the sons of Ammon warred with Israel, and the old men of Israel will go to take Jephthah out of the land of Tob.
And they will say to Jephthah, Come and be to us for leader, and we will war against the sons of Ammon.
And Jephthah will say to the old men of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and ye will drive me out from my father's house? and why came ye to me now when there is distress to you?
And the old men of Gilead will say to Jephthah, Therefore now we turned back to thee, and come thou with us and we will war against the sons of Ammon, and be to us for head to all dwelling in Gilead.
And Jephthah will say to the old men of Gilead, If ye turn me back to war against the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them before me, shall I be to you for head?
And the old men of Gilead will say to Jephthah, Jehovah shall be hearing between us, if we did not thus to thee according to thy word.
And Jephthah will go with the old men of Gilead, and the people will set him over them for head and for chief: and Jephthah will speak all his words before Jehovah in Mizpeh.
And Jephthah will send messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What to me and to thee that thou camest to me to war in my land.
And the king of the sons of Ammon will say to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took my land in his coming up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and even to Jordan: and now turn them back in peace.
And Jephthah will add yet and will send messengers to the king of the sons of Ammon:
And he will say to him, Thus said Jephthah, Israel took not the land of Moab and the land of the sons of Ammon:
When in their coming up out of Egypt, and Israel went in the desert, even to the sea of sedge, and he will come to Kadesh;
And Israel will send messengers to the king of Edom, saying, I will pass through now in thy land: and the king of Edom heard not And also to the king of Moab he sent; and he was not willing. And Israel dwelt in Kadesh.
And he will go into the wilderness, and he will encompass the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and he will come from the rising of the sun to the land of Moab, and they will encamp beyond Arnon; and they went not in to the bound of Moab, for Arnon is the bound of Moah
And Israel will send messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel will say to him, We will pass now through in thy land, even to my place.
And Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through in his bound; and Sihon will gather together all his people and will encamp in Jahaz, and he will war with Israel.
And Jehovah the God of Israel will give Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they will smite them: and Israel will inherit all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that land.
And they will inherit all the bound of the Amorites from Arnon and even to Jabbok, and from the desert and even to Jordan.
And now Jehovah the God of Israel drove out the Amorites from the face of his people Israel, and shalt thou inherit it?
Shalt thou not inherit what Chemosh thy god will give thee to inherit? and all which Jehovah our God drove out from our face, we will inherit it.
And now being good, art thou good above Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab? striving, did he contend with Israel, or warring, did he war against them.
In Israel's dwelling in Heshbon and her daughters and in Aroer and her daughters, and in all the cities which are upon the hands of Arnon, three hundred years? and why took ye not them away in that time?
And I sinned not against thee, and thou didst me evil to war against me: Jehovah the Judge will judge this day between the sons of Israel and between the sons of Ammon.
And the king of the sons of Ammon heard not to the words of Jephthah which he sent to him.
And the spirit of Jehovah will be upon Jephthah, and he will pass through Gilead and Manasseh, and he will pass through Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the sons of Ammon.
And Jephthah will vow a vow to Jehovah, and he will say, If giving, thou wilt give the sons of Ammon into my hand,
And it was, that coming forth which shall come forth from the doors of my house to my meeting in my turning back in peace from the sons of Ammon, and it was to Jehovah; and I brought it up a burnt-offering.
And Jephthah will pass over to the sons of Ammon to war against them: and Jehovah will give them into his hand.
And he will strike them from Aroer even to thy going to Minnith, twenty cities, and even to the meadow of the vineyards, with a very great smiting. And the sons of Ammon will be subdued from the face of the sons of Israel.
And Jephthah will come to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter will come forth to his meeting with drums and with lutes: and she the only begotten; not to him beside her, son nor daughter.
And it will be when he saw her, and he will tear his garments, and will say, Alas, my daughter bowing down, thou didst bow me down, and thou art in my trouble: and I opened my mouth to Jehovah, and I shall not be able to turn back.
And she will say to him, My father, opening thy mouth to Jehovah, do to me according to what came forth from thy mouth, after that Jehovah did for thee vengeance of thine enemies, of the sons of Ammon.
And she will say to her father, This word shall be done to me: desist from me two months, and I will go, and go down upon the mountains, and I will lament over my virginity, I and my friends.
And he will say, Go. And he will send her away two months: and she will go and her friends, and she will lament over her virginity upon the mountains.
And it will be from the end of two months, and she will turn back to her father and he will do to her his vow which he vowed: and she knew not man. And it will be a law in Israel,
From days of days the daughters of Israel will go to celebrate to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in the year.
And a man of Ephraim will cry out and will pass over north, and they will say to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to war against the sons of Ammon and didst not call to us to go with thee? we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
And Jephthah will say to them, I was a man of strife, I and my people and the sons of Ammon greatly; and I shall cry out to you, and ye saved me not from their hands.
And I shall see that thou savest not, and I shall put my soul in my hand, and I shall pass over to the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah will give them into my hand: and wherefore came ye up to me this day to war against me?
And Jephthah will gather together all the men of Gilead, and he will war with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead will strike Ephraim because they said, The escaped of Ephraim, ye of Gilead, in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh.
And Gilead will take the passages of Jordan before Ephraim: and it was that the escaped of Ephraim will say, I will pass over; and the men of Gilead will say to him, Thou an Ephrathite? and he will say, No.
And they will say to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he will say, Sibboleth and he will not form to speak thus. And they will seize him and they will slaughter him at the passages of Jordan. And there will fall in that time of Ephraim forty and two thousand.
And Jephthah will judge Israel six years: and Jephthah the Gileadite will die, and will be buried in the city of Gilead.
And after him Ibzan of the House of Bread, will judge Israel.
And there will be to him thirty sons and thirty daughters he sent without, and thirty daughters he brought in to his sons from without: and he will judge Israel seven years.
And Ibzan will die, and will be buried in the House of Bread.
And after him Elon the Zebulonite, will judge Israel; and he will judge Israel ten years.
And Elon the Zebulonite will die and will be buried in Elon in the land of Zebulon.
And after him Abdon, son of Hillel the Pirathonite, will judge Israel.
And there will be to him forty sons and thirty sons' sons riding upon seventy young asses: and he will judge Israel eight years.
And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, will die, and will be buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekite.
And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah will give them into the hand of Philisteim forty years.
And there will be one man from Zorah from the families of the Danites, and his name Manoah; and his wife sterile, and she bare not.
And a messenger of Jehovah will be seen to the woman, and will say to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not; and thou conceivedst and bearest a son.
And now, watch now, and drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean:
For behold thee pregnant, and thou bearest a son; and a razor shall not come up upon his head, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of Philisteim.
And the woman will go and will say to her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his sight as the sight of the messenger of God, very terrible: and I asked him not from whence he is, and his name he announced not to me.
And he will say to me, Behold, thee conceiving, and thou bearest a son; and now drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb, even to the day of his death.
And Manoah will pray to Jehovah and will say, With leave, my Lord, a man of God which thou sentest will he come now yet to us, and he will teach us what we shall do to the boy being brought forth.
And God will hear to the voice of Manoah, and the messenger of God will come yet to the woman, and she will sit in the field; and Manoah her man not with her.
And the woman will hasten and run, and announce to her man, and will say to him, Behold, the man was seen to me who came in the day to me.
And Manoah will rise and will go after his wife, and will come to the man, and will say to him, Thou the man who spake to the woman? and he will say, I.
And Manoah will say, Now shall come thy words. What shall be the judgment of the boy, and his work?
And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, From all I said to the woman she shall watch.
From all going forth from the vine of the wine she shall not eat, and wine and strong drink she shall not drink, and any thing unclean she shall not eat: all which I commanded she shall watch.
And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, We will detain thee now, and we will do before thee a kid of the goats.
And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, If thou shalt detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou shalt do a burnt-offering thou shalt do it to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was a messenger of Jehovah.
And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, What thy name, when shall come thy words and we honored thee?
And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, Wherefore this wilt thou ask for my name, and it is wonderful?
And Manoah will take a kid of the goats, and the gift, and will bring up, upon the rock to Jehovah; and he separating to do, and Manoah and his wife seeing.
And it will be in the going up of the flame from the altar to the heavens, and the messenger of Jehovah will go up in the flame of the altar and Manoah and his wife seeing; and they will fall upon their face to the earth.
And the messenger of Jehovah will no more add to be seen to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he is the messenger of Jehovah.
And Manoah will say to his wife, Dying, we shall die, because we saw God.
And his wife will say to him, If Jehovah were inclined to put us to death, he took not from our hand a burnt-offering and gift, and he shewed us not all these, and as now caused us not to hear such as this.
And the woman will bear a son, and she will call his name Samson. And the boy will grow, and Jehovah will bless him.
And the spirit of Jehovah will begin to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and between Eshtaol.
And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath from the daughters of Philisteim.
And he will go up and announce to his father and his mother, and will say, I saw a woman in Timnath from the daughters of Philisteim: and now take her to me for a wife.
And his father will say to him, and his mother, Is there not among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a woman, that thou goest to take a woman from uncircumcised Philisteim? And Samson will say to his father, Take her to me, for she is straight in mine eyes.
And his father and his mother knew not that it was from Jehovah that he seeking an occasion from Philisteim; for in this time Philisteim was ruling over Israel.
And Samson will go down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and they will come even to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared at his meeting.
And the spirit of Jehovah will fall suddenly upon him, and he will rend him as rending a kid, and nothing whatever in his hand: and he announced not to his father and to his mother what he did.
And he will go down and speak to the woman, and she will be right in the eyes of Samson.
And he will turn back after days to take her, and he will turn aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, an assembly of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.
And he will break it off in his hands, and going, will go and eat, and he will go to his father and to his mother, and will give to them, and they will eat: and he announced not to them that from the body of the lion he broke off the honey.
And his father will go down to the woman; and Samson will make there a drinking, for so did the young men.
And it will be when they saw him, and they will take thirty companions, and they will be with him.
And Samson will say to them, I will propose to you an enigma: if announcing, ye shall announce it to me in seven days of the drinking, and ye find out, and I will give to you thirty wide garments and thirty exchanges of garments:
And if ye shall not be able to announce to me, and ye give me thirty wide garments and thirty exchanges of garments: and they will say to him, Propose thine enigma and we will hear it.
And he will say to them, Out of him eating came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they were not able to announce the enigma in three days.
And it will be in the seventh day, and they will say to Samson's wife, Persuade thy man and he shall announce to us the enigma, lest we shall burn thee and thy father's house with fire: did ye not call to us to possess us?
And Samson's wife will weep upon him, and will say, Thou only hatedst me and lovedst me not: thou didst propose an enigma to the sons of my people, and to me thou didst not announce it. And he will say to her, Behold, to my father and to my mother I announced it not, and shall I announce to thee?
And she will weep upon him seven days which were to them of the drinking: and it will be in the seventh day, and he will announce to her, for she urged him: and she will announce the enigma to the sons of her people.
And the men of the city will say to him in the seventh day before the sun will go down, What is sweet above honey? and what is strong above the lion? and he will say to them, Unless ye ploughed with my heifer ye found not out my enigma.
And the spirit of Jehovah will fall suddenly upon him, and he will go down to Ashkelon and will strike from them thirty men, and he will take their spoils, and will give exchanges to those announcing the enigma. And his anger will kindle, and he will go up to his father's house.
And Samson's wife will be to his companion who was friend to him.
And it will be after days in days of the wheat harvest, and Samson will look after his wife with a kid of the goats; and he will say, I will go to my wife to the chamber. And her father gave him not to go in.
And her father will say, Saying, I said that hating, thou didst hate her, and I will give her to thy companion: is not her small sister good above her? Now she shall be to thee in her stead.
And Samson will say to them, This time I was more blameless than Philisteim if I shall do evil with them.
And Samson will go and will take three hundred foxes, and will take torches, and will turn tail to tail, and will put one torch between two tails in the midst.
And he will kindle fire upon the torches and will send into the standing grain of Philisteim, and will burn up from the heap of sheaves and even to the standing grain, and even to the vineyard and the olive.
And Philisteim will say, Who did this? and they will say, Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, for he took his wife and he will give her to his companion. And Philisteim will go up and will burn her and her father with fire.
And Samson will say to them, If ye will do according to this, if I was avenged by you, and afterward I will desist.
And he will strike them leg upon thigh, a great smiting. And he will go down and dwell in the cleft of the rock Etam.
And Philisteim will go up and encamp against Judah and will be dispersed in Lehi.
And the men of Judah will say to them, Why came ye up against us? and they will say, To bind Samson we came up, to do to him as he did to us.
And three thousand men of Judah will go down to the cleft of the rock Etam, and they will say to Samson, Knewest thou not that Philisteim is ruling over us? and what this thou didst to us? and he will say to them, As they did to me, so did I to them.
And they will say to him, To bind thee we came down, to give thee into the hand of Philisteim. And Samson will say to them, Swear to me lest ye shall fall upon me yourselves.
And they will say to him, saying, No; but binding, we will bind thee and give thee into their hand: and killing, we will not kill thee. And they will bind him with two new cords and will bring him up from the rock.
He came even to Lehi, and Philisteim shouted at his meeting: and the spirit of Jehovah will come suddenly upon him, and the cords which were upon his arms will be as flax which was burnt in fire, and his bands will melt from off his hands.
And he will find the jaw-bone of an ass, fresh, and he will stretch forth his hand and take it and will strike with it a thousand men.
And Samson will say, With the jaw-bone of the ass, a heap, two heaps, with the jaw-bone of the ass I struck a thousand men.
And it will be when he finished to speak, and he will cast away the jawbone from his hand, and he will call that place, the lifting up the jaw-bone.
And he will thirst greatly, and he will call to Jehovah and will say, Thou gavest into the hand of thy servant this great salvation, and now shall I die with thirst and fall into the hand of Philisteim?
And God will rend the socket which is in the jaw-bone, and waters will come forth from it; and he will drink, and his spirit will turn back, and he will live. For this he called its name, the Fountain of him Calling, which is in Lehi even to this day.
And he will judge Israel in the days of Philisteim twenty years.
And Samson will go to Gaza, and he will see there a woman, a harlot, and he will go in to her.
To the Gazites, saying, Samson came here. And they will encompass, and will lie in wait for him all the night in the gate of the city, and they will be silent all the night, saying, During the light of the morning and we killed him.
And Samson will lie till half the night, and he will rise in half the night, and he will seize the doors of the gate of the city and with the two door-posts, and will remove them with the bar, and will set upon his shoulders, and he will bring them up to the head of the mountain which is upon the face of Hebron.
And it will be after this, and he will love a woman in the valley of Shorek, and her name Delilah.
And the princes of Philisteim will come up and will say to her, Persuade him, and see in what is his great strength, and in what we shall prevail against him, and bind him to humble him: and we give to thee each a thousand and a hundred of silver.
And Delilah will say to Samson, Announce now to me in what is thy great strength, and in what thou shalt be bound to humble thee.
And Samson will say to her, If they shall bind me with seven moist cords that were not dried, and I was weak and shall be as another man.
And the princess of Philisteim will bring up to her seven moist cords which were not dried, and she will bind him with them.
And lying in wait dwelling by her in the chamber. And she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will tear away the cords as a thread of tow will be torn away in its smelling the fire. And his strength was not known.
And Delilah will say to Samson, Behold, thou deceivest me, and thou wilt speak to me lies: this time announce to me now in what thou shalt be bound.
And he will say to her, If binding, they shall bind me with new cords which work was not done with them, and I was weak and was as another man.
And Delilah will take new cords and will bind him with them, and she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson, (and the lier in wait dwelling in the chamber.) And he will tear them away from off his arms as a thread.
And Delilah will say to Samson, Till now thou deceivedst me, and thou wilt speak to me lies: announce to me in what thou shalt be bound. And he will say to her, If thou shalt weave the seven braids of my head with the warp.
And she will fasten with a peg, and she will say to him, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will awake from his sleep, and he will tear away the peg of the braid and the warp.
And she will say to him, Wilt thou say, I loved thee, and thy heart not with me? This three times thou didst deceive me, and didst not announce to me in what is thy great strength.
And it will be in her pressing upon him with her words all the days, and she will urge him, and his soul will be shortened to death;
And he will announce to her all his heart, and he will say to her, A razor came not up upon my head, for I am devoted to God from my mother's womb: if I were shaved, and my strength removed from me, and I was weak, and was as all men.
And Delilah will see that he announced to her all his heart, and she will send and call to the princes of Philisteim, saying, Come up to me this time; for he announced to her all his heart And the princes of Philisteim will come up to her, and will bring up the silver in their hand.
And she will cause him to sleep upon her knees; and she will call to a man, and she will shave the seven braids of his head; and she will begin to humble him, and his strength will remove from him.
And she will say, Philisteim upon thee, Samson. And he will awake from his sleep, and say, I will go forth as once upon once, and shake myself. And he knew not that Jehovah removed from him.
And Philisteim will seize him, and they will bore out his eyes, and will bring him down to Gaza and bind him with fetters of brass, and he will be grinding in the house of bonds.
And the hair of his head will begin to grow as when he was shaven.
And the princes of Philisteim gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: and they will say, Our god gave into our hand Samson our enemy.
And the people will see him and praise their god, for they said, God gave into our hand our enemy, and him destroying our land, and who multiplied our wounded.
And it will be when their heart will be joyful, and they will say, Call to Samson, and he shall play to us. And they will call to Samson from the house of bonds and he will play before them, and they will set him between the pillars.
And Samson will say to the boy holding him by his hand, Permit me and I shall feel the pillars which the house stood upon them, and I will lean upon them.
And the house was filled with men and women, and there were all the princes of Philisteim, and upon the roof about three thousand men and women looking upon the sport of Samson.
And Samson will call to Jehovah, and will say, Lord Jehovah, remember me now, and strengthen me now but this once, O God, and I will avenge myself one vengeance for my two eyes of Philisteim.
And Samson will clasp the two pillars the midst of which the house stood upon them, and he stayed himself upon them, one with his right hand and one with his left.
And Samson will say, My soul shall die with Philisteim. And he will bow with strength, and the house will fall upon the princes and upon all the people which are in it And the dead will be more which he killed in his death than which he killed in his life.
And his brethren and all the house of his father will go down and will lift him up, and will bring him up, and bury him between Zorah and between Eshtaol in the grave of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
And there will be a man of mount Ephraim and his name Micah.
And he will say to his mother, The thousand and one hundred of silver which was taken for thee, and thou cursedst me, and saidst also in mine ears, behold, the silver with me; I took it And his mother will say, Blessed my son to Jehovah.
And he will turn back the thousand and hundred of silver to his mother, and his mother will say, Consecrating, I consecrated the silver to Jehovah from my hand to my son, to make a carved thing and a molten: and now I will turn it back to thee.
And he will turn back the silver to his mother; and his mother will take two hundred of silver and will give it to the goldsmith, and he will make it a carved thing and molten: and it will be in the house of Micah.
And the man Micah to him a house of gods; and he will make an ephod and a teraphim, and he will fill the hand of one of his sons, and he will be to him for priest.
In those days not a king in Israel, as man will do the right in his eyes.
And there will be a youth from the House of Bread, of Judah, from the families of Judah, and he a Levite, and he sojourned there.
And the man will go from the city from the House of Bread, of Judah, to sojourn wherever he shall find: and he will come to mount Ephraim, even to the house of Micah, to make his way.
And Micah will say to him, Whence shalt thou come? and the Levite will say to him, I am from the House of Bread, of Judah, and I go to sojourn where I shall find.
And Micah will say to him, Dwell with me, and be to me for a father and for a priest, and I will give to thee ten of silver for days, and an equipment of garments, and means of life. And the Levite will go in.
And the Levite will be willing to dwell with the man; and the youth will be to him as one of his sons.
And Micah will fill the hand of the Levite; and the youth will be to him for a priest, and he will be in the house of Micah.
And Micah will say, Now I knew that Jehovah will be good to me, for there being to me the Levite for priest.

And the sons of Dan will send from their families five men from their extremities, men sons of power, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to search the land and to examine it; and they will say to them, Go and examine the land: and they will come to mount Ephraim, even to the house of Micah, and they will lodge there.
And they with the house of Micah, and they knew the voice of the youth, the Levite: and they will turn aside there and say to him, Who brought thee hither? and what didst thou in here? and what to thee here?
And he will say to them, according to this, and according to this, Micah did to me, and he will hire me, and I to him for priest.
And they will say to him, Ask now of God, and we shall know whether our way shall prosper which we go upon it.
And the priest will say to them, Go for peace: before Jehovah, your way which ye shall go in it.
And the five men will go and come to Laish, and they will see the people which in the midst of her, dwelling in confidence according to the judgment of the Sidonians, quiet and confiding; and none shaming the word in the land, a possessor heaping up, and they far off from the Sidonians, and the word was not to them with man.
And they will come to their brethren of Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren will say to them, What ye?
And they will say, Arise, and we will go up upon them: for we saw the land, and behold, exceedingly good: and ye being still, ye shall not neglect to go, to come to inherit the land.
In your going, ye shall come to a people confiding, and to a land of many hands: for God gave it into your hand, a place where no want there of any word which is in the earth.
And they will remove from thence from the families of the Danites, and from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
And they will go up and encamp in the City of Forests, in Judah: for this they called that place the camp of Dan, even to this day: behold, it behind the City of Forests.

And the five men going to search the land of Laish will answer and say to their brethren, Knew ye that there is in these houses an ephod, and a teraphim, and a carved thing, and a molten? and now know ye what ye will do.
And they will turn aside there and come to the house of the youth the Levite, of the house of Micah, and they will ask him for peace.
And the six hundred men girded with their weapons of war, stood at the door, which were of the sons of Dan.
And the five men having gone to search the land will go up; they will come in there; they took the carved thing and the ephod, and the teraphim and the molten thing: and the priest stood at the door of the gate, and the six hundred men girded with weapons of war.
And these came in to Micah's house, and they will take the carved thing, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten thing; and the priest will say to them, What are ye doing?
And they will say to him, Be silent; put thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us, and be to us for father and for priest: is it good for thee to be priest to the house of one man, or for thee to be priest to a tribe and to a family in Israel?
And the priest's heart will be joyous, and he will take the ephod, and the teraphim, and the carved thing, and will go in the midst of the people.
And they will turn and go and put the little ones and the cattle and the wealth before them.

And he will say, My gods which I made, ye took away, and the priest, and ye will go: and what to me yet? and what this ye will say to me, What to thee?
And the sons of Dan will say to him, Thy voice shall not be heard with us lest men bitter of soul shall strike upon you, and thy soul was taken away, and the soul of thy house.
And the sons of Dan will go to their way: and Micah will see that they were strong above him, and he will turn and turn back to his house.
And they took what Micah made, and the priest which was to him, and they will go to Laish, upon a people quiet and confiding: and they will strike them with the mouth of the sword, and they will burn the city with fire.

And they will set up to them Micah's carved thing, which he made, all the days the home of God was in Shiloh.
And it will be in those days, and no king in Israel; and it will be a man, a Levite, sojourning in the sides of mount Ephraim, and he will take to him a wife, a concubine, from the House of Bread, of Judah.
And his concubine will commit fornication against him, and she will go from him to the house of her father, to the House of Bread, of Judah, and she will be there the days of four months.
And her husband will rise and go after her to speak to her heart, to turn it back; and his young man with him and a pair of asses: and she will bring him into her father's house; and the father of the girl will see him and will rejoice at his meeting.

And it will be in the fourth day, and they will rise early in the morning, and he will rise up to go: and the girl's father will say to his son-in-law, Strengthen thine heart with a bit of bread, and afterward ye shall go.
And they will sit down and eat, they two together, and drink: and the girl's father will say to the man, Be willing, now, and lodge, and do good to thy heart.
And the man will rise up to go, and his father-in-law will press upon him, and he will sit down and lodge there.
And he will rise early in the morning in the fifth day, to go, and the girl's father will say, Strengthen now thy heart. And they lingered till the day declined, and they two will eat.
And the man will rise to go, he and his concubine and his boy; and his father-in-law, the girl's father, will say to him, Behold, now, the day weakened toward evening; lodge now: behold, the declining of the day; lodge here, and thy heart shall be joyous; and rise early to-morrow to your way and go to thy tent.
And the man was not willing to lodge, and he will rise and go, and, come even to the front of Jebus; this is Jerusalem: and with him a pair of asses saddled, and his concubine with him.
They with Jebus, and the day gone down greatly; and the youth will say to his lord, Go, now, and we will turn to this city of the Jebusites, and we will lodge in it.
And his lord will say to him, We will not turn into a strange city which is not of the sons of Israel here; and we passed over even to Gibeah.
And he will say to his boy, Go, and we will come near to one of the places and lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.
And they will pass over and will go; and the sun will go down to them near Gibeah which is to Benjamin.
And they will turn aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah: and he will go in and sit down in the street of the city, and no man receiving them to the house to lodge.
And behold, an old man came in from his work out of the field in the evening, and the man from mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeab; and the men of the place, sons of the Jaminite.
And he will lift up his eyes and will see the man of the way in the street of the city: and the old man will say, Whither wilt thou go? and from whence wilt thou come?
And he will say to him, We are passing from the House of Bread of Judah, even to the sides of mount Ephraim, from whence I am. And I will go to the House of Bread of Judah, and to the house of Jehovah; I went, and no man receiving me to his house.
And there is also straw, also fodder for our asses; and also there is bread and wine to me and to thy maid and to the boy with thy servants: no want of any word.
And the old man will say, Peace to thee: only all thy want upon me; only in the street thou shalt not lodge.
And he will bring him to his house, and will bring for the asses: and they will wash their feet, and eat and drink.
They doing good to their heart, and behold, the men of the city, men of the sons of Belial, encompassed the house, knocking upon the door; and they will say to the man, the lord of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man which came into thy house, and we will know him.
And the man, the lord of the house, will go forth to them, and will say to them, Nay, my brethren, ye will not do evil; after that this man came into my house ye will not do this folly.
Behold, my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them forth now, and humble ye them, and do to them the good in your eyes: and to this man ye will not do the word of this folly.
And the men were not willing to hear to him: and the man will lay hold upon his concubine and will bring out to them without, and they will know her, and will gratify their desires upon her all the night, even till morning: and they will send her away in the ascending of the dawn.
And the woman will come at the turning of the morning and she will fall at the door of the house where her lord there, even till the light.
And her lord will rise in the morning and will open the doors of the house and will come forth to go to his way, and behold, the woman his concubine, fallen at the door of the house, and her hands upon the threshold.
And he will say to her, Arise, and go. And none answered. And he will take her upon the ass, and the man will rise and go to his place.
And he will come to his house and will take a knife, and will lay hold upon his concubine, and he will give her, even to her bones, into twelve pieces, and he will send her into all the bound of Israel.
And it was, all seeing and saying, It was not, and it was not seen according to this from the day of the coming up of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt till this day: consider for yourselves upon it; take counsel and speak.
And all the sons of Israel will go forth, and the assembly will be gathered together as one man, from Dan even to the Well of the Oath, and the land of Gilead to Jehovah to Mizpeh.
And the chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel will be drawn out in the gathering of the people of God, four hundred thousand men, footmen, drawing swords.
And the sons of Benjamin will hear that the sons of Israel went up to Mizpeh. And the sons of Israel will say, Speak ye; how was this evil?
And the man the Levite will answer, the husband of the woman slain, and he will say, To Gibeah which is to the sons of Benjamin I came, I and my concubine to lodge.
And the lords of Gibeah will rise upon me and will encompass the house against me by night; they purposed to kill me: and my concubine they humbled, and she died.
And I laid hold of my concubine and I cut her in pieces, and sent her into all the field of the inheritance of Israel: for they did wickedness and folly in Israel.
Behold, all ye sons of Israel; give for yourselves the word and counsel here.
And all the people will rise as one man, saying, We will not go a man to his tent, and we will not turn aside a man to his house:
And now this the word which we will do to Gibeah against her by lot.
And we will take ten men to the hundred to all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred to a thousand, and a thousand to ten thousand, to take provision for the people, to do for those going to Gibeah of Benjamin; according to all the folly which was done in Israel.
And they will be gathered together every man of Israel against the city, associated as one man.
And the tribes of Israel will send men into all the tribes of Benjamin, saying, What this evil which was among you?
And now give the men, sons of Belial, which are in Gibeah, and we will put them to death, and take away evil from Israel. And Benjamin would not hear to the voice of their brethren the sons of Israel.
And the sons of Benjamin will be gathered together from the cities to Gibeah to go out to war with the sons of Israel.
And the sons of Benjamin will be reviewed in that day from the cities, twenty and six thousand men drawing the sword, besides from the inhabitants of Gibeah they were reviewed, seven hundred chosen men.
From all this people, seven hundred chosen men shut up of the right hand, slinging at a hair, and they will not miss.
And the men of Israel were reviewed, beside Benjamin, four hundred thousand men drawing sword: all these men of war.
And the sons of Israel will rise and will go up to the house of God and will ask in God, and will say, Who shall go up for us in the beginning to war with the sons of Benjamin? and Jehovah will say, Judah in the beginning.
And the sons of Israel will rise in the morning and will encamp against Gibeah.
And the men of Israel will go forth to war with Benjamin; and the men of Israel will prepare to war with them at Gibeah.
And the sons of Benjamin will come forth from Gibeah, and they will destroy in that day in Israel twenty and two thousand men to the earth.
And the people, the men of Israel, will strengthen themselves, and they will add to prepare war in the place which they set in array in the first day.
And the sons of Israel will go up and will weep before Jehovah till the evening, and they will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I add to draw near to war with the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Jehovah will say, Go up against him.
And the sons of Israel will come near to the sons of Benjamin in the second day.
And Benjamin will go forth to their meeting from Gibeah in the second day, and they will destroy of the sons of Israel yet eighteen thousand men to the earth; all these drawing the sword.
And all the sons of Israel and all the people will go up, and they will come to the house of God, and they will weep, and they will sit there before Jehovah, and they will fast in that day till the evening, and they will bring up burnt-offerings and peace before Jehovah.
And the sons of Israel will ask in Jehovah, (and there the ark of the covenant of God in those days,
And Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I add yet to go forth to war with the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I desist? And Jehovah will say, Go up; for to-morrow I will give him into thy hand.
And Israel will put liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.
And the sons of Israel will go up to the sons of Benjamin in the third day, and they will set in array against Gibeah as once upon once.
And the sons of Benjamin will come forth to the meeting of the people, they were separated from the city; and they will begin to strike of the people wounded as once upon once, in the highways, which one went up to the house of God, and one to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men in Israel.
And the sons of Benjamin will say, They are smitten before us as at first. And the sons of Israel said, We will flee, and draw him away from the city to the highways.
And all the men of Israel rose up from his place and set in array against Baal-Tamar: and the ambush of Israel rushing forth from its place from the naked place of Gibeah.
And there will come forth from before against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men from all Israel, and the battle was heavy: and they knew not that evil touched upon them.
And Jehovah will smite Benjamin before Israel: and the sons of Israel will destroy of Benjamin in that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drawing sword.
And the sons of Benjamin will see that they were smitten: and the men of Israel will give place to Benjamin, for they trusted to the ambush which they put by Gibeah.
And the ambush hasted, and they will spread out against Gibeah; and the ambush will draw out and will strike all the city with the mouth of the sword.
And there was an appointment to the men of Israel with the ambush for them to raise up a great ascending of smoke from the city.
And the men of Israel will turn about in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike the wounded among the men of Israel, about thirty men: for they said, Surely, smiting, he was smitten as the first battle.
And the ascending began to go up from the city of the pillar of smoke, and Benjamin will turn behind, and behold, the whole city ascended up to the heavens.
And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin will hasten, for they saw that evil touched upon them.
And they turned before the men of Israel to the way of the desert; and the battle overtook them; and those from the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
They surrounded Benjamin, pursuing him from Nohah, treading him down even to the front of Gibeah, from the rising of the sun.
And there will fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these men of strength.
And they will turn and flee to the desert, to the rock Rimmon: and they will glean in the highways five thousand men; and they will pursue after him even to Gidom, and will strike of him two thousand men.
And all those falling of Benjamin will be twenty and five thousand men drawing sword in that day; all these men of strength.
And there will turn and flee to the desert to the rock Rimmon, six hundred men, and they will dwell in the rock Rimmon four months.
And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin, and they will strike them with the mouth of the sword, from the city, the men even to cattle, all being found: also all the cities being found they set on fire.
And the men of Israel sware in Mizpeh, saying, A man from us shall not give his daughter to Benjamin for wife.
And the people will go to the house of God and will sit there even till evening, before God; and they will lift up their voice and weep a great weeping.
And they will say, Wherefore, Jehovah, God of Israel, was this in Israel to miss one tribe this day from Israel?
And it will be on the morrow, and the people will rise early and they will build there an altar, and will bring up burnt-offerings and peace.
And the sons of Israel will say, Who from all the tribes of Israel that went not up in the gathering to Jehovah? For there was a great oath against him who went not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, Dying, he shall die.
And the sons of Israel will lament for Benjamin their brother, and they will say, There was cut off this day one tribe from Israel.
What shall we do for them to those being left for wives, and we sware by Jehovah not to give to them from our daughters for wives?
And they will say, What one from the tribes of Israel who came not up to Jehovah to Mizpeh? And behold, not a man came from the camp of Jabesh-Gilead to the gathering.
And the people will be reviewed, and behold, not a man there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead.
And they will send there twelve thousand men from the sons of power, and they will command them, saying, Go and smite them, the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead, with the mouth of the sword, and the women and the little ones.
And this the word which ye shall do: every male and every woman knowing the bed of a male ye shall exterminate.
And they will find of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred girls, virgins, who knew not man by the bed of a male: and they will bring them to the camp of Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan.
And all the assembly will send and speak to the sons of Benjamin who were in the rock Rimmon, and they will call peace to them.
And Benjamin will turn back in that time; and they will give them the women which they saved alive from the women of Jabesh-Gilead: and they found for them not thus.
And the people lamented for Benjamin, because Jehovah made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
And the old men of the assembly will say, What shall we do for those remaining for wives, for the women were destroyed from Benjamin?
And they will say, An inheritance for the escaped to Benjamin, and a tribe shall not be destroyed from Israel.
And we shall not be able to give to them wives from our daughters, for the sons of Israel sware, saying, Cursed he giving a wife to Benjamin.
And they will say, Behold, a festival of Jehovah in Shiloh from days to days, which is from the north to the house of God, from the rising of the sun to the highway going from the house of God to Shechem, and from the south to Lebonah.
And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;
And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh shall come forth to dance in dances, and come ye out from the vineyards and catch for yourselves each his wife from the daughters of Shiloh) and go to the land of Benjamin.
And it was when their fathers or brothers shall come to contend against us, and we said to them, Be merciful to us with them, because we took not a man his wife in the battle; for ye gave not to them according to the time, ye shall transgress.
And the sons of Benjamin will do so, and they will take wives for their number from those dancing, which they took by force: and they will go and turn back to their inheritance, and they will build cities, and they will dwell in them.
And the sons of Israel will go from there in that time, a man to his tribe and to his family, and they will go forth from there, a man to his inheritance.
In those days no king in Israel: a man will do the right in his eyes.
And it will be in the days of the judging of the judges, and there will be a famine in the land. And a man from the house of bread of Judah will go to sojourn in the field of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
And the name of the man Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi, and the name of his two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from the house of bread of Judah. And they will come to the field of Moab and be there.
And Elimelech will die, the husband of Naomi; and she will be left, and her two sons.
And they will take to them wives from the Moabitesses; the name of the one, Orpah, and the name of the second, Ruth: and they will dwell there about ten years.
And Mahlon and chilion, also they two, will die; and the woman will be left of her two children and of her husband.
And she will arise and her daughters-in-law, and she will turn back from the field of Moab: for she heard in the field of Moab that Jehovah reviewed his people to give bread to them.
And she will go forth from the place where she was there, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they will go in the way to turn back to the land of Judah.
And Naomi will say to her two daughters-in-law, Go, turn back each to the house of her mother: Jehovah will do mercy with you according as ye did with the dead, and with me.
Jehovah will give to you, and find ye rest, each in the house of her husband And she will kiss to them, and they will lift up their voice and weep.
And they will say to her, But with thee we will turn back to thy people.
And Naomi will say, Turn back, my daughters: wherefore will ye go with me? are yet to me sons in my bowels, and they were to you for husbands?
Turn back, my daughters, therefore; for I grew old from being for a husband. If I said, There is hope to me, also I was this night to a husband, and also I bare sons;
Will ye wait for them till they shall grow? Will remain shut up for them not to be for a husband? Nay, my daughters, for it is bitter to me greatly for you, that the hand of Jehovah will go forth against me.
And they will lift up their voice and weep yet. And Orpah will kiss to her mother-in-law; and Ruth adhered to her.
And she will say, Behold, thy sister-in-law turned back to her people, and to her gods: turn thou back after thy sister-in-law.
And Ruth will say, Thou shalt not urge upon me to forsake thee, to turn back from after thee: for where thou shalt go, I will go; and where thou shalt lodge, I will lodge: thy people my people, and thy God my God:
Where thou shalt die, I will die, and there will I be buried: thus will Jehovah do to me, and thus will he add, for death shall separate between me and between thee.
And she will see that she strengthening herself to go with her, and she will cease to speak to her.
And they two will go till they came to the house of bread. And it will be as they came to the house of bread, and all the city will be moved at them, and they will say, Is this Naomi?
And she will say to them, Ye shall not call to me Naomi; call to me, Mara: for the Almighty made bitter to me greatly.
I went away full, and Jehovah turned me back empty; wherefore will ye call to me Naomi, and Jehovah humbled me, and the Almighty did evil to me?
And Naomi will turn back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law, with her, turned back from the field of Moab: and they came to the house of bread in the beginning of the harvest of barley.
And to Naomi an acquaintance to her husband, a strong man of wealth, from the family of Elimelech; and his name Boaz.
And Ruth the Moabitess will say to Naomi, I will now go to the field and I will gather among the ears after; whom I shall find favor in his eyes. And she will say to her, Go, my daughter.
And she will go, and come and gather in the field after the reapers; and she will happen from chance upon a part of the field to Boaz, who was from the family of Elimelech.
And behold, Boaz came from the house of bread, and he will say to the reapers, Jehovah be with you. And they will say to him, Jehovah will bless thee.
And Boaz will say to his young man set over the reapers, To whom this maiden?
And the young man set over the reapers will answer and say, The Moabitess maiden; she turned back with Naomi from the field of Moab.
And she will say, I will gather now; and I collected among the sheaves after the reapers: and she will stand from that time of the morning, and even to this time of her sitting in the house a little.
And Boaz will say to Ruth, Heardest thou not, my daughter? Thou shalt not go to gather in another field, and also thou shalt not pass away from this; and here thou shalt adhere with my maidens:
Thine eyes upon the field which they shall reap, and thou wentest after them: did I not command the young men not to touch thee? And being thirsty and go thou to the vessels and drink from what the young men shall draw.
And she will fall upon her face and worship to the earth, and she will say to him, Wherefore did I find favor in thine eyes, and thou didst recognize me, and I a stranger?
And Boaz will answer and say to her, Announcing, it was announced to me all that thou didst with thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband: and thou wilt leave thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and thou wilt come to a people thou knewest not yesterday the third day.
Jehovah will recompense thy work, and thy reward shall be complete from Jehovah God of Israel, because thou camest to trust under his wings.
And she will say, Shall I find favor in thine eyes, my lord? For thou didst comfort me, and that thou spakest to the heart of thy servant, and shall I not be as one of thy servants?
And Boaz will say to her, At the time of eating draw near hither and eat from the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she will sit by side of the reapers: and he will lay hold of the parched grain for her, and she will eat and be satisfied, and will leave.
And she will rise up to gather, and Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Also she shall gather between the sheaves, and ye shall not shame her:
And also draw ye out for her from the sheaves and leave, and she gathering; and ye shall not rebuke her.
And she will gather in the field till the evening, and she will beat out what she gathered, and it will be about an ephah of barley.
And she will lift up and come to the city: and her mother-in-law will see what she gathered: and she will bring forth and give to her what she left from her being filled.
And her mother-in-law will say to her, Where didst thou gather this day? and where didst thou work? he recognizing thee shall be blessed. And she will announce to her mother-in-law whom she worked with him, and she will say, The name of the man whom I worked with him this day, is Boaz.
And Naomi will say to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he to Jehovah, who let not go his mercy with the living and with the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is near to us, he is blood relative.
And Ruth the Moabitess will say, Also that he said to me, With the young men which are to me thou shalt adhere till they finished all the harvest which is to me.
And Naomi will say to Ruth her daughter-in-law, Good, my daughter, that thou shalt go with his maidens, and they shall not light upon thee in another field.
And she will adhere to the maidens of Boaz, to gather even to the end of the harvest of barley and the harvest of wheat; and she will dwell with her mother-in-law.
And Naomi her mother-in-law will say to her My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it shall be well to thee?
And now is not Boaz from our acquaintance of whom thou wert with his maidens? Behold him winnowing the threshing-floor of barley this night.
And wash thou and anoint thyself, and put thy garments upon thee, and go down to the threshing-floor: thou shalt not make thyself known to the man till his finishing to eat and to drink.
And it will be in his lying down, and know thou the place where he shall lie down there, and go in and uncover from his feet, and lie down; and he will announce to thee what thou shalt do.
And she will say to her, All that thou shalt say to me, I will do.
And she will go down to the threshing-floor and she will do according to all that her mother-in-law commanded her.
And Boaz will eat and drink, and his heart will be done good to; and he will go to lie down upon the end of the heap: and she will come secretly and she will uncover from his feet, and lie down.
And it will be in the middle of the night, and the man will be terrified: and he will turn and behold a woman lying from his feet.
And he will say, Who art thou? And she will say, I am Ruth thy servant: and spread thy wing over thy servant, for thou a blood relation.
And he will say, Blessed thou to Jehovah, my daughter: thou didst make good thy mercy at the last more than the beginning, so that thou wentest not after the young men, if poor and if rich.
And now, my daughter, thou shalt not fear; all which thou shalt say, I will do to thee: for all the gate of my people will know that thou art a woman of power.
And now that truly if I a blood relation: and also there is a blood relation nearer than I.
Lodge this night, and it being in the morning, if he will redeem thee, good; he shall redeem: and if he desire not to redeem thee, and I redeemed thee, Jehovah lives: lie down till morning.
And she will lie down from his feet till Morning: and she will rise before a man shall recognize his neighbor. And he will say, It shall not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.
And he will say, Bring me the upper garment which is upon thee, and hold fast upon it. And she will hold fast upon it, and he will measure six of barley, and he will place upon her: and he will go to the city.
And she will come to her mother-in-law, and she will say, Who art thou, my daughter? And she will announce to her all that the man did to her.
And she will say, These six of barley he gave to me; for he said, Thou shalt not go empty to thy mother-in-law.
And she will say, Sit, my daughter, till thou shalt know how the word will fall: for the man will not rest till he finished the word this day.
And Boaz went up to the gate and sat there: and behold, the blood relation whom Boaz spake of, passing by; and he will say, Turn aside, sit down here; thou such a one. And he will turn aside, and sit down.
And he will take ten men from the old men of the city, and he will say, Sit ye down here. And they will sit down.
And he will say to the blood relative, The portion of the field which was to our brother Elimelech, Naomi turning back from the field of Moab, sells:
And I said, I will reveal to thine ear, saying, Buy before the inhabitants, and before the old men of my people. If thou wilt redeem, redeem: and if thou wilt not redeem, announce to me, and I shall know: for none besides thee to redeem; and I after thee; and he will say, I will redeem.
And Boaz will say, In the day of thy buying the field from the hand of Naomi, and from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, thou boughtest it to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
And the near relative will say, I shall not be able to redeem for me, lest I shall destroy my inheritance: redeem to thyself; thou the near relative: for I shall not be able to redeem.
And this before in Israel upon redemption and upon exchange, to set up all the word; a man drew off his shoe and gave to his neighbor: and this the precept in Israel.
And the blood relative will say to Boaz, Buy for thee. And he will draw off his shoe.
And Boaz will say to the old men and all the people, Ye are witnesses this day that I bought all which was to Elimelech, and all which was to Chilion and Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi.
And also Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I bought to me for a wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; and the name of the dead shall not be cut off from his brethren and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
And all the people which are in the gate will say, and the old men, Witnesses. Jehovah will give the woman coming into thy house as Rachel and as Leah, which they two built up the house of Israel: and make thou power in Ephratah, and call a name in the house of bread.
And thy house shall be as the house of Pharez which Tamar bare to Judah, from the seed which Jehovah shall give to thee from this maiden.
And Boaz will take Ruth, and she will be to him for a wife: and he will come in to her, and Jehovah will give to her conception, and she will bring forth a son.
And the women will say to Naomi, Blessed be Jehovah who caused not to cease to thee a blood relation this day; and his name shall be called in Israel.
And being to thee for the turning back the soul, and to nourish thy gray hairs: for thy daughter-in-law who loved thee brought him forth; for she is good to thee above seven sons.
And Naomi will take the child and put him in her bosom, and she will be to him for nurse.
And the neighbors will call to him a name, saying, A son was born to Naomi; and they will call his name Obed: he the father of Jesse, the father of David.
And these the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Aminadab,
And Aminadab begat Nashon, and Nashon begat Salmon,
And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
And there will be one man from Ramathaim-Zophim, from mount Ephraim, and his name Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
And to him two wives; the name of the one Hannah, and the name of the second Peninnah: and there will be to Peninnah children, and to Hannah no children.
And this man went up from his city from days to days, to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies in Shiloh. And there the two sons of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah.
And the day will be and Elkanah will sacrifice, and he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughter, portions.
And to Hannah he will give one portion more, for he loved Hannah; and Jehovah shut up her womb.
Being grieved, her distress grieved her so that she was moved because Jehovah shut up about her womb.
And so she will do year by year when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she will be grieved, and she will weep and will not eat.
And Elkanah her man will say to her, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why will thy heart break? am I not good to thee above ten sons?
And Hannah will rise after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking: (and Eli the priest sat upon the throne by the door-post of the edifice of Jehovah:)
And she bitter of soul, and she will pray to Jehovah, and weeping, she will weep.
And she will vow a vow, and say, Jehovah of armies, if seeing, thou wilt see the affliction of thy servant and remember me, and thou wilt not forget thy servant, and give to thy servant seed of men, and I gave him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and a razor shall not come up upon his head.
And it was when she multiplied to pray before Jehovah, and Eli watched her mouth.
And Hannah she speaking upon her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice will not be heard: and Eli will think her to be intoxicated.
And Eli will say to her, How long wilt thou be intoxicated? remove thy wine from thee.
And Hannah will answer and say, No, my lord, I a woman hard of spirit, and wine and strong drink I drank not, and I will pour out my soul before Jehovah.
Thou wilt not give thy servant before a daughter of Belial, for from the abundance of my complaint and my grief I spoke even till now.
And Eli will answer and say, Go with peace: and the God of Israel shall give thine asking which thou didst ask of him.
And she will say, Thy servant shall find grace in thine eyes. And the woman will go to her way, and ate, and her face is to her no more.
And they will rise early in the morning and worship before Jehovah, and will turn back and will go to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah will know Hannah his wife, and Jehovah will remember her.
And it will be at the return of days Hannah will conceive and bear a son, and she will call his name Samuel, for of Jehovah I asked him.
And the man Elkanah and all his house will go up to sacrifice to Jehovah the sacrifice of days, and his vow.
And Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, Till the boy shall be weaned, and I brought him, and he saw the face of Jehovah, and he shall sit there even to forever.
And Elkanah her husband will say to her, Do the good in thine eyes; sit till thy weaning him; but Jehovah will raise up his word. And the woman will sit and suckle her son till her weaning him.
And she will bring him up with her when she weaned him, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine; and she will bring him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, and the boy a youth.
And they will slaughter the bullock, and they will bring the boy to Eli.
And she will say, With leave, my lord, thy soul living, my lord, I the woman standing with thee in here to pray to Jehovah.
For this boy I prayed, and Jehovah will give to me my asking which I asked of him.
And I also lent him to Jehovah; all the days which he lives he is lent to Jehovah. And they will worship to Jehovah there.
And Hannah will pray and say, My heart rejoiced in Jehovah, my horn was lifted up in Jehovah; my mouth was enlarged over mine enemies; for I was glad in thy salvation.
None holy as Jehovah, for none beside thee: and no rock as our God.
Ye shall not enlarge; will ye speak proud, proud? shall the impatient thing come forth from your mouth for Jehovah a God of knowledge, and doings were not made equal.
The bows of the mighty being broken, and the weak were girded with strength.
And those filled with bread hired themselves out; and they hungering, ceased till the barren shall bring forth seven; and she multiplying sons languished.
Jehovah killing and giving life; bringing down to hades and bringing up.
Jehovah dispossessing, and enriching: making low, but lifting up.
Raising up the weak from the dust, he will raise up the needy from the dung-hill to sit with the noble, and he will cause them to inherit a throne of glory, for to Jehovah the castings of the earth, and he will put the habitable globe upon them.
He will watch the feet of the merciful and the unjust shall be silent in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail.
Jehovah, they contending against him, shall be broken; in the heavens he will break them in pieces: Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and he will lift up the horn of his Messiah.
And Elkanah will go to Ramah, to his house. And the boy was serving Jehovah in the face of Eli the priest.
And the sons of Eli, sons of Belial; they knew not Jehovah.
And the priests judging the people, every man sacrificing a sacrifice; and the boy of the priest came as the flesh boiled, and the fork of three teeth in his hand;
And he struck into the fire-pan or into the boiler, or into the kettle, or into the pot; all which the fork will bring up the priest will take for himself. So they will do to all Israel coming there into Shiloh.
Also before they will burn the fat and the boy of the priest came and said to the man sacrificing, Thou shalt give flesh to roast for the priest; and he will not take from thee flesh boiled but living.
And the man will say to him, Burning, they shall burn the fat as the day, and take to thee as thy soul shall desire; and he said to him, But now thou shalt give, and if not I will take by force.
And the sin of the boys will be exceedingly great before Jehovah, for the men despised the gifts of Jehovah.
And Samuel serving before Jehovah, a boy girded with an ephod of linen.
And his mother will make to him a little upper garment, and bring up to him from days to days, in her coming up with her husband to sacrifice the sacrifice of days.
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah will set up to thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to Jehovah. And they went to his place.
For Jehovah reviewed Hannah, and she will conceive and bear three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel will be magnified with Jehovah.
And Eli a very old man, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and they will lie with the women going forth at the door of the tent of appointment.
And he will say to them, Wherefore will ye do according to these words? which I heard very evil words of all this people.
Nay, sons, for not a good report which I heard: causing the people of Jehovah to pass by.
If a man shall sin against a man, and God judged him; and if a man shall sin against Jehovah, who shall judge for him? and they will not hear to the voice of their father for Jehovah was willing to destroy them.
And the boy Samuel going, will become great and good, also with Jehovah and with men.
And a man of God will come to Eli and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Revealing myself, I was revealed to the house of thy father in their being in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh.
And choosing him from all the tribes of Israel to me for priest, to bring up upon mine altar to burn incense, to lift up the ephod before me; and I gave to the house of thy father all the fires of the sons of Israel.
Wherefore will ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon my gifts which I commanded to my habitation? and thou wilt honor thy sons above me to fatten yourselves from the chief of all the gifts of Israel my people.
For this Jehovah the God of Israel said, Saying, I said, Thy house and the house of thy father shall go before me even forever: and now Jehovah said, Far be it for me; for them honoring me I will honor, and they despising me shall be contemned.
Behold, the days coming and I cut off thy seed and the seed of thy father's house from being old in thy house.
And thou lookedst upon the straits of the habitation in all which shall seem good with Israel; and an old man shall not be in thy house all the days.
And a man I will not cut off to thee from mine altar to finish thine eyes and to cause thy soul to pine away: and all the increase of thy house, the men, shall die.
And this the sign to thee which shall come to thy two sons to Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they two shall die.
And I raised up to me a faithful priest, as in my heart and in my soul he shall do: and I built to him a faithful house; and he went before my Messiah all the days.
And it was all being left in thy house shall go to worship to him for a piece of silver and a round of bread; and he said, Add me to one of the priesthoods to eat a morsel of bread.
And the boy Samuel serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; no vision spread abroad.
And it will be in that day, and Eli lay down in his place, and his eyes began to be weak; he will not be able to see.
And before the lamp of God shall go out, and Samuel lay down in the edifice of Jehovah where there the ark of God.
And Jehovah will call to Samuel, and he will say, Behold me.
And he will run to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And he will say, I called not; turn back, lie down. And he will go and lie down.
And Jehovah will add yet to call Samuel. And Samuel will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou calledst to me. And he will say, I called not my son; turn back, lie down.
And before Samuel will know Jehovah, and before the word of Jehovah will be revealed to him,
And Jehovah will add to call Samuel in the third time. And he will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And Eli will discern that Jehovah called the boy.
And Eli will say to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it being if he shall call to thee, and say thou, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heard. And Samuel will go and lie down in his place.
And Jehovah will come and stand and call as once to once, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel will say, Speak, for thy servant heard.
And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Behold, I do a word in Israel which every one hearing it his two ears shall tingle.
In that day I will set up all against Eli which I spake against his house, beginning and finishing.
And I announced to him that I judge his house even forever, for the iniquity which he knew: for his sons cursing for themselves and he admonished them not.
And for this I sware to the house of Eli if the iniquity of the house of Eli shall be covered with sacrifice and with gifts even forever.
And Samuel will lie down till the morning, and he will open the doors of the house of Jehovah: and Samuel will be afraid of announcing the vision to Eli.
And Eli will call Samuel, and say, Samuel, my son. And he will say, Behold me.
And he will say, What the word he spake to thee? not now shalt thou hide from me: so will God do to thee, and so will he add, if thou shalt hide from me a word of all the word which he spake to thee.
And Samuel will announce to him all the words, and he hid not from him. And he will say, It is Jehovah: the good in his eyes he will do.
And Samuel will be magnified, and Jehovah was with him, and there fell not from all his words to the earth.
And all Israel knew from Dan to the Well of the Oath, that Samuel was faithful for a prophet to Jehovah.
And Jehovah will add to be seen in Shiloh: for Jehovah was revealed to Samuel by the word of Jehovah in Shiloh.
And the word of Samuel will be to all Israel. And Israel will go forth to the meeting of Philisteim for war, and they will encamp upon the Stone of Help: and Philisteim encamped in Aphek.
And Philisteim will set in array to meet Israel: and the battle will smite, and Israel will be smitten before Philisteim: and they will strike the array in the field, about four thousand men.
And the people will come to the camp, and the old men of Israel will, say, Wherefore did Jehovah smite us this day before Philisteim? We will take to us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and it shall come into the midst of us and save us from the hand of our enemies.
And the people will send to Shiloh, and they will lift up from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies, sitting upon the Cherubims: and there the two sons of Eli with the ark of the covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas.
And it will be when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the camp, and all Israel will shout with great shouts, and the earth will be put in motion.
And Philisteim will hear the voice of the shout, and they will say, What the voice of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? and they knew that the ark of Jehovah came into the camp.
And the Philisteim will be afraid, for they said, God came into the camp. And they will say, Wo to us! for at was not as this yesterday, the third day.
Wo to us! who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? these those gods smiting Egypt with every blow in the desert.
Be strong, and be for men, Philisteim, lest ye shall serve to the Hebrews as they served to you: and be for men and fight.
And Philisteim will fight and smite Israel, and they will flee, a man to his tent: and the blow will be very great, and there will fall from Israel thirty thousand footmen.
And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.
And a man of Benjamin will run from the array, and he will come to Shiloh in that day; and his garments rent and earth upon his head.
And he will come, and behold, Eli sitting upon a seat of the side of the way, looking about: for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. And the man came to announce in the city, and all the city will cry out.
And Eli will hear the voice of the cry, and will say, What the voice of this noise? And the man hastened, and he will go in and announce to Eli.
And Eli the son of ninety and eight years; and his eyes standing, and he will not be able to see.
And the man will say to Eli, I came from the array, and I fled from the array this day; And he will say, What was the word, my son?
And he bearing tidings will answer and say, Israel fled before Philisteim, and also a great slaughter was among the people, and also thy two sons died, Hophni and Phinehas; and the ark of God was taken.
And it will be when he made mention of the ark of God, and he will fall from off the seat backwards by the side of the gate, and his neck will break, and he will die: for he was an old Man and heavy. And he judged Israel forty years.
And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, conceived to bring forth: and she will hear the message of the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law and her husband, and she will bow and bring forth, for her pains turned upon her.
And about the time of her death, and they standing by will speak to her, Thou shalt not be afraid, for thou broughtest forth a son. And she answered not, and set not her heart.
And she will call the boy, Where the Glory? saying, The glory uncovered from Israel: (for the taking of the ark of God, and for her father-in-law, and her husband.)
And she will say, The glory uncovered from Israel, for the ark of God was taken.
And Philisteim took the ark of God, and they will bring it from the Stone of Help to Ashdod.
And Philisteim will take the ark of God and bring it to the house of Dagon, and they will set it up by Dagon.
And the Ashdodites will rise early on the morrow, and behold, Dagon fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah. And they will take Dagon, and will turn him back to his place.
And they will rise early in the morning, and behold, Dagon fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah: and the head of Dagon, and the two palms of his hands cut off upon the threshold; only Dagon was left upon him.
Therefore the priests of Dagon, and all coming into Dagon's house, will not tread upon the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod even to this day.
And the hand of Jehovah will be heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he will lay them waste and smite them with tumors, Ashdod and her bounds.
And the men of Ashdod will see that it is thus, and they will say, The ark of the God of Israel shall not dwell with us, for his hand was hard upon us and upon Dagon our god.
And they will send and gather all the princes of Philisteim to them, and they will say, What shall we do to the ark of the God of Israel? And they will say, To Gath shall the ark of the God of Israel be turned about: and they will turn the ark of the God of Israel about.
And it will be after they turned it about, and the hand of Jehovah will be against the city with a very great consternation: and he will smite the men of the city from small and even to great, and tumors will break forth to them.
And they will send the ark of God to Ekron. And it will be when the ark of God came to Ekron, and the Ekronites will cry out, saying, They turned about to me the ark of the God of Israel to kill me and my people.
And they will send and gather all the princes of Philisteim, and they will say, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and it shall turn back to its place, and it shall not slay me and my people: for the consternation of death was in all the city; the hand of God was greatly heavy there.
And the men who died not were struck with tumors: and the cry of the city will go up to the heavens.
And the ark of Jehovah will be in the field of Philisteim seven months.
And Philisteim will call for the priests and for the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of Jehovah? make known to us in what we shall send it to its place?
And they will say, If sending away the ark of the God of Israel, ye shall not send it away empty; for turning back, ye shall turn back a trespass: then ye shall be healed and we shall make known to you why his hand shall not be removed from you.
And they will say, What the trespass that we shall turn back to him? And they will say, The number of the princes of Philisteim, five gold tumors, and five gold mice: for one smiting upon them all and upon your princes.
And make likenesses of your tumors, and likenesses of your mice destroying the land; and give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
And why shall ye make your hearts heavy, as Egypt and Pharaoh made their heart heavy? Did he not then do wonders among them, and they will send them away, and they will go?
And now take and make one new wagon, and two heifers giving milk, which a yoke came not up upon them, and make fast the heifers upon the wagon, and turn back their young from after them to the house.
And take the ark of Jehovah and set it upon the wagon; and the vessels of gold which ye turned back to him ye shall put a trespass in a box from its side; and send it, and it went.
And see if it shall go up the way of its bound to the House of the Sun, it did to us this great evil: and if not we shall know that not his hand struck upon us; it was a chance to us.
And the men did so, and they will take two heifers giving milk, and they will make them fast to the wagon, and they shut up their young in the house.
And they set the ark of Jehovah into the wagon, and the box, and the mice of gold, and the likenesses of the tumors.
And the heifers will look about in the way, upon the way of the House of the Sun, in one highway they went going, and they lowed, and they turned not to the right and to the left; and the princes of Philisteim went after them, even to the bound of the House of the Sun.
And the House of the Sun reaping the harvest of wheat in the valley: and they will lift up their eyes and see the ark, and they will rejoice to see.
And the wagon came into the field of Joshua of the House of the Sun, and it will stand there; and there a great stone: and they will cleave asunder the wood of the wagon, and the heifers they brought up a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
And the Levites brought down the ark of Jehovah, and the coffer that was with it, which in it the vessels of gold, and put upon the great stone: and the men of the House of the Sun brought up burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices in that day to Jehovah.
And the five princes of Philisteim saw, and they will turn back to Ekron in that day.
And these the tumors of gold which Philisteim turned back a trespass to Jehovah; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.
And the mice of gold, the number of all the cities of Philisteim, to the five princes from the fortified city, even to the village of the countryman, and even to the great meadow which they put upon it the ark of Jehovah, even to this day in the field of Joshua of the House of the Sun.
And he will strike upon the men of the House of the Sun, for they saw in the ark of Jehovah, and he will strike upon the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men: and the people will mourn because Jehovah smote among the people a great smiting.
And the men of the House of the Sun will say, Who shall be able to stand before Jehovah this holy God? and to whom shall it go up from us?
And they will send messengers to the inhabitants of the City of Forests, saying, Philisteim turned back the ark of Jehovah; come down, bring it up to you.
And the men of the City of Forests will come up and will bring up the ark of Jehovah, and they will bring it to the house of Abinadab in the hill, and Eleazar his son he consecrated to Watch the ark of Jehovah.
And it will be from the day the ark dwelt in the City of Forests, and the days will be multiplied; and they will be twenty years: and all the house of Israel will lament after Jehovah.
And Samuel will say to all the house of Israel, saying, If with all your heart ye turn back to Jehovah, remove the strange gods out of the midst of you, and Ashtaroth, and prepare your hearts to Jehovah, and serve him alone, and he will deliver you from the hand of Philisteim.
And the sons of Israel will put away the Baalims and Ashtaroth, and will serve Jehovah alone.
And Samuel will say, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to Jehovah.
And they will gather together to Mizpeh, and draw water and pour out before Jehovah; and they will fast in that day and say there, We sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel will judge the sons of Israel in Mizpeh.
And Philisteim will hear that the sons of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, and the princes of Philisteim will go up against Israel And the sons of Israel will hear, and be afraid of the face of Philisteim.
And the sons of Israel will say to Samuel, Thou wilt not keep silence from us, crying to Jehovah our God, and he will save us from the hand of Philisteim.
And Samuel will take one fat lamb and bring up a burnt-offering wholly to Jehovah: and Samuel will cry to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah will answer him.
And Samuel will be bringing up the burnt-offering, and Philisteim drew near to war against Israel: and Jehovah will thunder with a great voice in that day upon Philisteim and he will discomfit them; and they will be smitten before Israel.
And the men of Israel will go forth out of Mizpeh and they will pursue Philisteim, and they will strike them even from beneath to the House of Pasture.
And Samuel will take one stone and set between Mizpeh and between Shen, and he will call its name the Stone of Help; and he will say, Till now Jehovah helped us.
And Philisteim will be subdued, and they will no more add to come into the bound of Israel: and the hand of Jehovah will be against Philisteim all the days of Samuel.
And the cities that Philisteim took from Israel will be turned back to Israel, from Ekron, even to Gath; and their bound Israel will deliver from the hand of Philisteim: and peace will be between Israel and between the Amorite.
And Samuel will judge Israel all the days of his life.
And he went as often as from year to year, and be turned about the House of God, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and he judged Israel in all these places.
And his turning back to Ramah; for there his house; and there he judged Israel; and he will build an altar there to Jehovah.
And it will be when Samuel was old, he set his sons judges to Israel.
And the name of his son the firstborn will be Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: judges at the Well of the Oath.
And his sons went not in his way, and they will incline after plunder, and they will take a gift, and they will turn away from judgment.
And all the old men of Israel will gather together and will come to Samuel to Ramah;
And they will say to him, Behold, thou wert old, and thy sons went not in thy ways: now set up for us a king to judge us as all the nations.
And the word will be evil in the eyes of Samuel when they said, Give to us a king to judge us: and Samuel will pray to Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Hear to the voice of the people to all which they will say to thee: for not thee did they reject, but me they rejected from reigning over them.
According to all the works which they did from the day I brought them up out of Egypt, and even to this day, and they will forsake me and serve other gods, so they do also to thee.
And now hear to their voice: but protesting, thou shalt protest to them, and announce to them the judgment of the king who shall reign over them.
And Samuel will say all the words of Jehovah to the people asking from him a king.
And he will say, This shall be the judgment of the king who shall reign over you: your sons he will take and set for himself, for his chariots and for his horsemen; and running before his chariots.
And to set to himself captains of thousands and captains of fifties; and to plough his ploughing and to reap his harvest, and to do all his fighting and all his chariots.
And your daughters he will take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers.
And your fields and your vineyards, and your olive trees, the good he will take and give to his servants.
And of your seeds and of your vineyards he will take the tenth and give to his eunuchs and to his servants.
And your servants and your maids, and your good young men, and your asses, he will take and make for his services.
And of your sheep he will take the tenth: and ye shall be to him for servants.
And ye cried out in that day from before your king which ye chose to yourselves; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
And the people will refuse to hear to the voice of Samuel; and they will say, Nay; but a king shall be over us.
And we were as all the nations; and our king judged us and went out before us, and fought our battles.
And Samuel will hear all the words of the people, and he will speak them in the ears of Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Hear to their voice, and make a king for them. And Samuel will say to them, Go ye a man to his city.
And there will be a man of Benjamin, and his name Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bechorah, son of Aphiah, son of a man, a Jaminite, a man of strength.
And to him was a son and his name Saul, a young man and good: and not a man of the sons of Israel good above him: from his shoulder and from above, high above all the people.
And the she asses of Kish, Saul's father, will be lost: and Kish will say to Saul, his son, Take now with thee one of the boys, and arise, Go seek the asses.
And he will pass over in mount Ephraim, and he will pass over into the land of Shalisha, and they found not: and they will pass over into the land of Shalim, and not there: and he will pass over into the land of the Jaminite, and they found not.
They went into the land of Zuph, and Saul said to his boy that was with him, Come, and we will turn back, lest my father shall leave from the asses, and be afraid for us.
And he will say to him, Behold now, a man of God in this city, and the man honored; all which he shall speak, coming, will come: now we will go there, perhaps he will announce to us our way which we went upon it.
And Saul will say to his boy, And behold, we will go, and what shall we bring to the man? for the bread departed from our vessels, and not a gift to bring to the man of God: what with us?
And the boy will add to answer Saul, and he will say, Behold, we shall find in my hand the fourth of a shekel of silver: and I gave it to the man of God and he announced to us our way.
Before in Israel thus said the man in his going to inquire of God, Come, and we will go even to him seeing, for a prophet this day he will be called; before him seeing.
And Saul will say to his boy, Thy word was good; going, we will go: and they will go to the city where was the man of God there.
They going up in the ascent of the city and they found girls going forth to draw water, and they will say to them, Is he seeing, here?
And they will answer them and will say, He is; behold, before thee: hasten now, for this day he came to the city for a sacrifice this day to the people Bamah.
As you come to the city thus ye shall find him, before he will go up to Bamah to eat: for the people will not eat till his coming, for he will bless the sacrifice; after this they being called will eat. And now go up, for this day ye shall find him.
And they will go up to the city: they coming into the midst of the city, and behold, Samuel coming forth to meet them, to go up to Bamah.
And Jehovah revealed in the ear of Samuel one day, before Saul came, saying,
About the time to-morrow I will send to thee a man from the land of Benjamin, and anoint him for leader over my people Israel; he shall save my people from the hand of Philisteim; for I saw my people, for their cry came to me.
And Samuel saw Saul, and Jehovah answered him, Behold the man that I said to thee, He shall rule over my people.
And Saul will draw near to Samuel in the midst of the gate, and he will say, Announce to me, now, where the house of him seeing.
And Samuel will answer Saul, and say, I the seeing: go up before me to Bamah, and eat with me this day, and I will send thee away in the morrow, and all that is in thy heart I will announce to thee.
And for the asses lost to thee this day three days, thou shall not set thy heart upon them, for they have been found. And to whom all the desire of Israel? is it not to thee and to all thy father's house?
And Saul will answer and say, Am not I a son of the Jaminite, from the littleness of the tribes of Israel, and my family small more than all the families of the tribes of Benjamin and wherefore spakest thou to me according to this word?
And Samuel will take Saul and his boy, and will bring them to the chamber, and will give to them place among the first of those being called, and they about thirty men.
And Samuel will say to the cook, Thou shalt give the portion which I gave to thee, which I said to thee, Put it with thee.
And the cook will lift up the leg and that upon it, and will set before Saul. And he will say, Behold that being left set before thee: eat, for to the appointment being watched for thee, saying, I called the people. And Saul will eat with Samuel in that day.
And they will go down from Bamah to the city, and he will speak to Saul upon the roof.
And they will rise early: and it will be about the hind of the dawn, and Samuel will call to Saul to the roof, saying, Arise, and I will send thee away. And Saul will arise, and they two will go forth, he and Samuel without.
They coming down to the extremity of the city, and Samuel said to Saul, Say to the boy, Pass over before us: and he will pass over: and thou stand according to the day, and I will cause thee to hear the word of God.
And Samuel will take a flask of oil and pour upon his head, and he will kiss him and say, Is it not that Jehovah anointed thee for leader over his inheritance?
In thy going this day from me and thou shalt find two men by the sepulchre of Rachel in the bound of Benjamin in Zelzah; and they said to thee, The asses were found which thou wentest to seek: and behold, thy father cast off the matters of the asses, and was afraid for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
And pass on from thence and beyond, and thou camest to the oak of Tabor, there three men shall find thee going up to God, to the house of God, one lifting up three kids and one lifting up three rounds of bread, and one lifting up a skin of wine.
And they asked thee for peace, and they gave thee two of bread, and thou receivedst from their hands.
After this thou shalt come to the hill of God, where there Philisteim standing: and it will be when thou comest there to the city, and thou didst light upon a band of prophets coming down out of Bamah, and before them a lyre, and a drum, and a pipe, and a harp; and they prophesying.
And the shout of Jehovah fell suddenly upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them, and be turned to another man.
And it was when these signs shall come upon thee, do for thyself what thy hand shall find, for God is with thee.
And go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I come down to thee to bring up burnt offerings, to sacrifice sacrifices of peace: seven days shalt thou wait till my coming to thee, and I made known to thee what thou shalt do.
And it was as he turned away his shoulder to go from Samuel, and God will turn to him another heart: and all these signs will come in that day.
And they will come there to Gibeah, and behold, a band of prophets to meet him; and the spirit of God will fall suddenly upon him and he will prophesy in the midst of them.
And it will be all will know him from yesterday the third day, and will see him and behold, he prophesied with the prophets, and the people will say, a man to his neighbor, What was this to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
And a man will answer from thence and will say, And who their father? For this it was for a parable, Is Saul also among the prophets?
And he will finish prophesying and will come to Bamah.
And Saul's friend will say to him and to his boy, Whither went ye? And he will say, To seek the asses; and we shall see that nothing, and we shall go to Samuel.
And Saul's friend will say, Announce now, to me, what Samuel said to you.
And Saul will say to his friend, Announcing, he announced to us that they found the asses; and the word of the kingdom he announced not to him, which Samuel said to him.
And Samuel will convoke the people together to Jehovah at Mizpeh;
And he will say to the sons of Israel, Thus spake Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I will deliver you out of the hand of Egypt, and out of the hand of all kingdoms pressing you.
And ye this day rejected your God who himself saves you from all your evils and your straits; and ye will say to him, That thou shalt put a king over us. And now stand ye before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.
And Samuel will cause all the tribes of Israel to come near, and the tribe of Benjamin will be taken.
And he will cause the tribe of Benjamin to come near by his families, and the family of Matri will be taken, and Saul son of Kish will be taken: and they will seek and he was not found.
And they will ask yet of Jehovah, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah will say, Behold, he hid himself among the vessels.
And they will run and take him from thence, and he will stand in the midst of the people; and he will be high above all the people, from his shoulders and above.
And Samuel will say to all the people, See whom Jehovah chose to him, for none like him among all the people. And all the people will shout and say, The king shall live.
And Samuel will speak to the people the judgment of the kingdom; and he will write in a book and put before Jehovah. And Samuel will send away all the people, a man to his house.
And also Saul went to his house at Gibeah; and there will go with him the army whom God touched their heart.
And the sons of Belial said, What shall this save us? And they will despise him and will not bring him a gift; and he will be as keeping silence.
And Nahash the Ammonite will come up and encamp against Jabesh-Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh will say to Nahash, Cut out to us a covenant, and we will serve thee.
And Nahash the Ammonite will say to them, Upon this I will cut out to you in boring out for you every right eye, and I put it a reproach upon all Israel.
And the old men of Jabesh will say to him, Let go to us seven days, and we will send messengers in every bound of Israel: and if none save us we will come forth to thee.
And the messengers will come to the hill of Saul and will speak the words in the ears of the people: and all the people will lift up their voice and weep.
And behold, Saul came after the cattle from the field; and Saul will say, What to the people that they will weep? and they will recount to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
And the spirit of God will fall suddenly upon Saul in his hearing these words, and his anger will kindle greatly.
And he will take a pair of oxen and will cut them in pieces, and will send in all the bound of Israel by the hand of the messengers, saying, Whoever will not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, thus shall be done to his oxen. And the fear of Jehovah will fall upon the people, and they will come forth as one man.
And he will review them in Bezek, and the sons of Israel will be three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
And they will say to the messengers coming, Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, To-morrow salvation shall be to you in the heat of the sun. And the messengers will come and announce to the men of Jabesh, and they will rejoice.
And the men of Jabesh will say, To morrow we will come forth to you, and do to us air the good in your eyes.
And it will be on the morrow, and Saul will put the people three heads; and they will come into the midst of the camp in the watch of the morning, and they will strike Ammon till the heat of the day: and there will be those being left and they will be scattered, and two among them were not left together.
And the people will say to Samuel, Who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Ye shall give up the men and we will put them to death.
And Saul will say, A man shall not die in this day, for this day Jehovah made salvation in Israel.
And Samuel will say to the people, Go, and we will go to Gilgal, and we will renew there the kingdom.
And all the people will go to Gilgal; and will sacrifice there sacrifices of peace before Jehovah: and Saul will rejoice there and all the men of Israel, even greatly.
And Samuel will say to all Israel, Behold, I heard to your voice, to all that ye said to me, and I will make a king over you.
And now, behold, the king going before you: and I grew old and I was gray-headed; and my sons, behold them with you: and I went before you from my youth even to this day.
Behold me: answer against me before Jehovah and before his Messiah, whose ox did I take? or whose ass did I take? and whom did I oppress? whom did I vex? and from whose hand did I take a ransom and hidden mine eyes with it? and I will turn back to you.
And they will say, Thou didst not oppress us, and thou didst not vex us, and thou didst not take any thing from man's hand.
And he will say to them, Jehovah the witness against you, and his Messiah the witness this day that ye found nothing in my hand. And he will say, A witness.
And Samuel will say to the people, Jehovah who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers from the land of Egypt.
And now, stand ye, and I will judge you before Jehovah, all the justices of Jehovah which he did with you and with your fathers.
When Jacob came into Egypt, and your fathers will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will send Moses and Aaron, and they will bring forth your fathers from Egypt, and they will turn them back into this place.
And they will forget Jehovah their God, and he will sell them into the hand of Sisera, chief of the army of Razor, and into the hand of Philisteim, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they will war against them.
And they will cry to Jehovah, and say, We sinned, for we forsook Jehovah, and we shall serve the Baalims and Ashtaroth: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee.
And Jehovah will send Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and he will deliver you from the hand of your enemies from round about, and ye shall dwell confidently.
And ye will see that Nahash, king of the sons of Ammon, came against you, and ye will say to me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: and Jehovah your God your king.
And now, behold the king which ye chose, which ye asked! and behold, Jehovah gave a king over you.
If ye will fear Jehovah and serve him, and hear to his voice, and ye shall not rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and ye shall be, also ye, and the king which reigned over you, after Jehovah your God.
And if ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and the hand of the Lord was against you and your fathers.
Also now stand ye and see this great word which Jehovah does before your eyes.
Is it not the harvest of wheat this day? I will call to Jehovah and he will give voices and rain; and know ye and see that your wickedness is great which ye did in the eyes of Jehovah to ask for you a king.
And Samuel will call to Jehovah, and Jehovah will give voices and rain in that day: and all the people will be greatly afraid of Jehovah and Samuel.
And all the people will say to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to Jehovah thy God, and we shall not die; for we added upon all our sins the wickedness to ask for us a king.
And Samuel will say to the people, Ye shall not be afraid: ye did all this wickedness: but ye shall not turn aside from after Jehovah, and serve ye Jehovah with all your heart.
And ye shall not turn aside: for after vanities which will not profit, and they will not deliver, for they are vanities.
For Jehovah will not cast off his people on account of his great name, for Jehovah willed to make you to him for a people.
Also I, far be it to me sinning against Jehovah ceasing to pray for you: and I taught you in the good and straight way.
But fear ye Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for see what he magnified with you.
And if doing evil, ye shall do evil, also ye, also your king; ye shall perish.
Saul the son of a year in his reigning; and two years he reigned over Israel,
And Saul will choose to him three thousand from Israel; and two thousand will be with Saul in Michmash, and in the mount of the house of God, and a thousand were with Jonathan in the hill of Benjamin: and the remainder of the people he sent a man to his tent.
And Jonathan will strike a garrison of Philisteim which is in the hill, and Philisteim will hear, and Saul will clang upon the trumpet in all the land, saying, The Hebrews shall hear.
And all Israel heard, saying, Saul struck a garrison of rovers, and Israel became loathsome with the rovers; and the people will be convoked together after Saul to Gilgal.
And the rovers were gathered together to war with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is upon the lip of the sea for multitude: and they will come up and encamp in Michmash, east of the House of Nothing.
And the men of Israel saw that a strait to him, for the people were pressed; and the people will hide in caves, and in thorn-bushes, and in rocks, and in towers, and in pits.
And the Hebrews passed over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul he yet in Gilgal, and all the people trembled after him.
And he will wait some days according to the appointment which was of Samuel: and Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
And Saul will say, Bring near to me the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bring up the burnt-offering.
And it will be when he finished to bring up the burnt-offering, and behold, Samuel came; and Saul went forth to his meeting, and to bless him.
And Samuel will say, What didst thou? and Saul will say, Because I saw, that the people were scattered from me, and thou camest not at the appointment of days, and the rovers were gathered together to Michmash;
And saying, Now the rovers will come down to me to Gilgal, and I entreated not the face of Jehovah: and I will contain myself, and will bring up a burnt-offering.
And Samuel will say to Saul, Thou didst foolishly: thou didst not watch the commands of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee; for now Jehovah prepared thy kingdom for Israel, even for ever.
And now thy kingdom shall not be set up: Jehovah sought to him a man according to his heart, and Jehovah will command him for leader over his people, because thou didst not watch what Jehovah commanded thee.
And Samuel will rise and will go up from Gilgal to the hill of Benjamin. And Saul will review the people being found with him about six hundred men.
And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people found with them, dwelt in the hill of Benjamin: and the rovers encamped in Michmash.
And he destroying will come forth from the camp of the rovers, three heads: one head will turn to the way of Ophrah, to the land of Shual:
And one head will turn the way of the House of the Hollow; and one head will turn the way of the bound projecting over the valley of the hyenas of the desert.
And an artificer will not be found in all the land of Israel: (for the rovers said, Lest the Hebrews shall make a sword or spear:)
And all Israel went down to the rovers, to hammer each his plough-shares, and his coulter, and his axe, and his plough-shares.
And there was a notching of mouths for the plough-shares, and for the coulters, and for the three-pronged, and for the axes, and for setting the goads.
And it was in the day of battle, and a sword and spear were not found in the hand of all the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: and they will be found to Saul and to Jonathan his son.
And a station of the rovers will come forth to the passage of Michmash.
And it will be the day, and Jonathan son of Saul, will say to the boy lifting up his arms, Come, and we will pass over to the station of the rovers, which is from beyond this And to his father he announced not.
And Saul dwelt in the extremity of the hill under the pomegranate which is in the precipice. And the people that were with him, about six hundred men.
And Ahiah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli the priest of Jehovah in Shiloh, lifting up an Ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan went.
And between the passages where Jonathan sought to pass through upon the garrison of the rovers, and the tooth of a rock from beyond this, and the tooth of a rock from beyond this; and the name of the one Bozez, and the name of the one Seneh.
And the tooth of the one pressing from the north in front of Michmash, and the other from the south in front of the hill.
And Jonathan will say to the boy lifting up his arms, Come, and we will pass over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: perhaps Jehovah will do for us: for no restraining to Jehovah to save by a multitude or by few.
And he lifting up his arms will say to him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn for thyself; behold me with thee according to thy heart.
And Jonathan will say, Behold, we pass over to the men, and we will disclose ourselves to them.
If thus they shall say to us, Be still till our reaching to you; and we stood our lowest place, and we will not go up to them.
And if thus they shall say, Come up upon us; and we went up: for Jehovah gave them into our hand; and this to us the sign.
And they two will disclose to the garrison of the rovers; and the rovers will say, Behold, the Hebrews coming forth from the holes where they hid there.
And the men of the garrison will answer Jonathan and him lifting up his arms, and they will say, Come up to us, and we will make a word known to you. And Jonathan will say to him lifting up his arms, Come up after me: for Jehovah gave them into the hand of Israel.
And Jonathan will go up upon his hands and upon his feet, and he lifting up his arms after him: and they will fall before Jonathan; and he lifting up his arms, slaying after him.
And the first blow which Jonathan struck, and he lifting up his arms, will be about twenty men in about half the furrow of a yoke of a field.
And terror will be in the camp, in the field, and in all the people of the garrison: and the destroyers trembled, they also, and the earth will be moved; and it will be for the terror of God.
And the watchman to Saul will see in the hill of Benjamin, and behold, the multitude melting away, and going, and fighting.
And Saul will say to the people that were with him, Review now, and see who went from us. And they will review, and behold, not Jonathan and he lifting up his arms.
And Saul will say to Ahiah, Bring near the ark of God. For the ark of God was in that day and the sons of Israel.
And it will be while Saul spake to the priest, and the multitude which was in the camp of the rovers, and it went going and increasing: and Saul will say to the priest, Take back thy hand.
And Saul will be convoked and all the people which were with him, and they will go even to the battle: and behold, the sword of a man will be against his neighbor, a very great confusion.
And the Hebrews being to the rovers about yesterday the third day, who went up with them into the camp round about, and also they to be with Israel which were with Saul and, Jonathan.
And every man of Israel being hid in mount Ephraim, heard that the rovers fled, and they will cleave together, also they after them in the battle.
And Jehovah will save Israel in that day: and the battle passed over to the house of nothing.
And the man Israel was pressed in that day: and Saul will curse the people, saying, Cursed the men who shall eat bread till the evening, and I was avenged of mine enemy. And all the people tasted not bread.
And all the land came into a thicket; and honey will be upon the face of the field.
And the people will come to the thicket, and behold, the honey went; and none putting his hand to his mouth, for the people will be afraid of the oath.
And Jonathan heard not in his father's causing the people to swear: and he will stretch forth the extremity of the rod which is in his hand, and he will dip it in the droppings of the honey, and he will turn back his hand to his mouth, and his eyes will see.
And a man from the people will answer and say, Thy father adjuring, adjured the people, saying, Cursed the man who shall eat bread this day. And the people were wearied.
And Jonathan will say, My father troubled the land: see, now, that mine eyes saw, because I tasted a little of this honey.
But if eating, the people ate this day from the spoil of his enemies which he found; for now was not the blow greater against the rovers?
And they will strike the rovers in that day, from Michmash to the oak: and the people were greatly wearied.
And the people will make to the spoil, and they will take sheep and oxen, and the young of oxen, and they will slaughter on the earth: and the people will eat upon the blood.
And they will announce to Saul, saying, Behold, the people sinning against Jehovah to eat upon the blood. And he will say, Ye acted treacherously: roll to me this day a great stone.
And Saul will say, Be ye dispersed among the people, and say to them, Bring near to me a man his ox, and a man his sheep, and slaughter here and eat; and ye shall not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood. And all the people will bring near, each his ox in his hand this night, and they will slaughter there.
And Saul will build an altar to Jehovah: this altar he began to build to Jehovah.
And Saul will say, We will go down after the rovers by night, and we will plunder among them till the light of the morning, and we will not leave a man among them. And they will say, Do all the good in thine eyes. And the priest will say, We will draw near here to God.
And Saul will ask in God, Shall I go down after the rovers? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel? And he will not answer him in that day.
And Saul will say, Draw near here all the corners of the people: and know and see in what was this sin this day.
For Jehovah lives, having saved Israel, for if it is in Jonathan my son, for dying he shall die. And none from all the people answered him.
And he will say to all Israel, Ye shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on one side. And the people will say to Saul, Do the good in thine eyes.
And Saul will say to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give the truth. And Jonathan will be taken, and Saul: and the people will come forth.
And Saul will say, Cast between me and between Jonathan my son. And Jonathan will be taken.
And Saul will say to Jonathan, Announce to me what thou didst And Jonathan will announce to him and say, Tasting, I tasted with the extremity of the rod which was in my hand, a little honey, and behold, I shall die.
And Saul will say, So will Jehovah do, and so will he add; for dying, thou shalt die, Jonathan.
And the people will say to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who did this great salvation in Israel? Far be it: Jehovah lives if there shall fall from the hair of his head to the earth; for he did with Jehovah this day. And the people will let Jonathan go free, and he died not.
And Saul will come up from after the rovers: and the rovers went to their place.
And Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and he will fight round about against all his enemies, against Moab and against the sons of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the rovers: and in all which he will turn he will disturb.
And he will do in strength, and he will strike Amalek, and deliver Israel from the hand of him plundering him.
And the sons of Saul will be Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchisua; and the names of his two daughters, the name of the first-born, Merab, and the name of the small, Michal.
And the name of Saul's wife Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the chief of his army, Abner, son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
And Kish the father of Saul: and Ner the father of Abner, son of Abiel.
And strong war will be against the rovers all the days of Saul: and Saul seeing every strong man and every son of strength, and he will gather him to him.
And Samuel will say to Israel, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee for king over his people, over Israel: and now hear to the voice of the words of Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, I reviewed what Amalek did to Israel, how he set for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt.
Now go and strike Amalek, and exterminate all which is to him, and thou shalt not spare to him; and kill from man even to woman, from child even to suckling, from ox and even to sheep, from camel and even to ass.
And Saul will cause the people to hear, and he will review them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.
And Saul will come even to a city of Amalek, and he will lie in wait by the torrent.
And Saul will say to the Kenite, Go, remove, go down from the midst of the Amalekites, lest I shall add thee with him; for ye did mercy with all the sons of Israel in their coming up out of Egypt And the Kenite will remove from the midst of Amalek.
And Saul will strike Amalek from Havilah thy coming to Shur, which is upon the face of Egypt.
And he will seize Agag, king of Amalek, living, and be exterminated all the people with the mouth of the sword.
And Saul and the people will have pity upon Agag, and upon the good of the sheep, and the oxen and the double, and upon the lambs and upon all the good, and they were not willing to exterminate them: and every work despised and wasting away, they exterminated it.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Samuel, saying,
I lamented that I made Saul for king, for he turned back from after me, and my words he set not up. And it will kindle to Samuel, and he will cry to Jehovah all the night.
And Samuel will rise early to meet Saul in the morning, and it will be announced to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he sets up to him a hand, and he will turn round and pass over and go down to Gilgal.
And Samuel will come to Saul: and Saul will say to him, Blessed thou of Jehovah: I set up the word of Jehovah.
And Samuel will say, And what the voice of sheep in mine ear, and the voice of the oxen which I hear?
And Saul will say, From the Amalekites they brought them; which the people had pity upon the good of the sheep and of the oxen in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we exterminated.
And Samuel will say to Saul, Desist, and I will announce to thee what Jehovah spake to me by night. And they will say to him, Speak.
And Samuel will say, Wert thou not little in thine eyes, thou the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah will anoint thee for king over Israel?
And Jehovah will send thee in the way, and he will say, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners Amalek, and fight against him even till ye consumed them.
And wherefore didst thou not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and wilt clothe thyself with the spoil, and thou wilt do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And Saul will say to Samuel, That I heard to the voice of Jehovah, and I will go in the way which Jehovah sent me, and I will bring Agag king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed Amalek.
And the people will take from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief devoted to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.
And Samuel will say, Was it pleasing to Jehovah in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as to hear to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to hear, above a good sacrifice, and to hearken, above the fat of rams.
For the sin of divination, rebellion; and deceit, and the family gods of stubbornness. Because thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and he will reject thee from being king.
And Saul will say to Samuel, I sinned: for I passed by the mouth of Jehovah, and thy words: for I feared the people and I will hear to their voice.
And now, take away now, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship to Jehovah.
And Samuel will say to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah will reject thee from being king over Israel.
And Samuel will turn about to go, and he will seize upon the wing of his upper garment, and it will rend.
And Samuel will say to him, Jehovah rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and gave it to thy neighbor being good above thee.
And also the glory of Israel will not lie, and he will not lament: for he not a man to lament.
And he will say, I sinned this time; honor me now before the old men of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me, and I worshipped to Jehovah thy God.
And Samuel will turn back after Saul; and Saul will worship to Jehovah.
And Samuel will say, Bring near to me Agag king of Amalek. And Agag will come to him, wavering: and Agag will say, Surely the bitterness of death was removed.
And Samuel will say, As thy sword bereaved women of children, so of women shall thy mother be bereaved of children. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.
And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house of the hill of Saul.
And Samuel will not add to see Saul, even to the day of his death: for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah lamented that he made Saul king over Israel.
And Jehovah will say to Samuel, How long mournest thou for Saul, and I rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and go; I will send thee to Jesse of the House of Bread, for I saw among his sons a king to me.
And Samuel will say, How shall I go? and Saul hearing, and killing me. And Jehovah will say, Thou shalt take a heifer of the cows in thy hand and say, To sacrifice to Jehovah I came.
And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do: and anoint to me whom I say to thee.
And Samuel will do what Jehovah spake, and he will go to the House of Bread. And the old men of the city will tremble to meet him, and say, Thy coming peace?
And he will say, Peace: to sacrifice to Jehovah I came: be ye consecrated and come with me to the sacrifice. And he will consecrate Jesse and his sons, and call for them to the sacrifice.
And it will be in their coming, and he will see Eliab, and he said, Surely, before Jehovah his Messiah.
And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Thou shalt not look upon his aspect or upon the height of his stature; for I rejected him: for not what man will see, for man will see with the eyes, and Jehovah will see at the heart.
And Jesse will call for Abinadab, and he will cause him to pass by before Samuel. And he will say, Also this Jehovah chose not.
And Jesse will cause Shammah to pass by. And he will say, Also in this Jehovah chose not.
And Jesse will cause seven of his sons to pass by before Samuel: and Samuel will say to Jesse, Jehovah chose not in these.
And Samuel will say to Jesse, Are these the whole of the boys? And he will say, The small was yet left, and behold, he fed among the sheep. And Samuel will say to Jesse, Send and take him, for we will not turn about till his coming here.
And he will send and bring him. And he red, with beauty of eyes, and good of sight And Jehovah will say, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
And Samuel will take the horn of oil and he will anoint him in the midst of his brethren: and the spirit of Jehovah will cleave to David from that day and over. And Samuel will rise and go to Ramab.
And the spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah terrified him.
And Saul's servants will say to him, Behold now, an evil spirit of God terrifying thee.
Will our lord now say to thy servants before thee, Seek out a man knowing to play upon the harp: and it was in the evil spirit of God being upon thee, and he playing with the hand and doing good to thee.
And Saul will say to his servants, See, now, a man to me being good to play, and bring to me.
And one of his boys will answer and say, I saw a son to Jesse of the House of Bread, knowing to play, mighty of strength, and a man of war, and discerning the word, and a man of figure, and Jehovah with him.
And Saul will send messengers to Jesse, and he will say, Send to me David thy son who is with the sheep.
And Jesse will take a heap of bread and a sack of wine, and one kid of the goats, and he will send by the hand of David his son to Saul.
And David will come to Saul, and stand before him: and he will love him greatly; and he will be to him lifting up the arms.
And Saul will send to Jesse, saying, David shall stand now before me, for he found grace in mine eyes.
And it was in the spirit of God being upon Saul, and David took the harp and played with his hand, and it was refreshed to Saul, and it was good to him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
And the rovers will gather together their camps for war, and they will gather together at Shocoth, which is to Judah, and they will encamp between Shocoth and between Azekah, in the end of Damim.
And Saul and the man Israel were gathered together, and they will encamp in the valley of Elah, and they arranged the battle to meet the rovers.
And the rovers standing on the mountain from hence, and Israel standing on the mountain from thence, and the valley between them.
And there went forth a man of the sons of the camp of the rovers, Goliah his name, from Gath; his height six cubits and a span.
And a helmet of brass upon his head, and a coat of mail of scales he put on; and the weight of the coat of mail five thousand shekels of brass.
And brass fronts upon his feet, and a javelin of brass between his shoulders.
And the arrow of his spear as the beam of weavers, and the flame of his spear, six hundred shekels of iron. And he lifting up a shield went before him.
And he will stand and call to the ranks of Israel, and say to them, Wherefore will ye come forth to arrange the battle? am not I of the rovers, and ye servants to Saul? select to yourselves a man, and he shall come down to me.
If he shall be able to war with me and strike me, and we were to you for servants: and if I shall be able against him and strike him, and ye were to us for servants, and ye served us.
And he of the rovers will say, I upbraided the ranks of Israel this day; ye shall give to me a man and we will fight together.
And Saul will hear and all Israel, these words of him of the rovers, and they will be terrified and greatly afraid.
And David, son of a man, that Ephrathite, of the House of Bread of Judah, and his name Jesse; and to him eight sons; and the man in the days of Saul went an old man among men.
And three sons of Jesse, the great ones, going, went after Saul to war: and the names of his three sons which went in the war, Eliab the first-born and his second, Abinadab, and the third, Shammah.
And David, he the small; and the three great ones went after Saul.
And David went and turned back from Saul to feed his father's sheep at the House of Bread.
And he of the rovers will draw near, the morning and the evening, and he will take a stand forty days.
And Jesse will say to David his son, Take now to thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain, and this ten of bread, and run to the camp to thy brethren.
And these ten cuttings of milk thou shalt bring to the chief of a thousand; and thou shalt review thy brethren for peace, and take their pledge.
And Saul, and they, and every man of Israel, in the valley of Elah, warring with the rovers.
And David will rise early in the morning, and will cast the sheep upon a watcher, and he will lift up and go as Jesse commanded him; and he will come to the track, and the army going forth to the array and they shouted in the war.
And Israel will arrange, and the rovers, array to meet array.
And David will cast the utensils from off him upon the hand of the watcher of the utensils, and be will run to the array, and will come and ask to his brethren for peace.
And he speaking with them, and behold, a man of the sons came up, Goliah of the rovers, his name, from Gath, from the ranks of the rovers: and he will speak according to these words, and David will hear.
And every man of Israel in their seeing the man, will flee from his face, and they will fear greatly.
And the man Israel will say, Saw ye this man coming up? for to upbraid Israel he came up: and it was the man who shall strike him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give to him his daughter, and his father's house he will make free in Israel.
And David will say to the men standing with him, saying, What shall be done to the man who shall strike this one of the rovers, and take away the reproach from Israel? for who this uncircumcised of the rovers? for he upbraided the ranks of the living God.
And the people will say to him according to this word, saying, Thus it shall be done to the man who shall smite him.
And Eliab his brother the great, will hear in his speaking to the men, and Eliab's anger will kindle against David, and he will say, Why this camest thou down? and upon whom didst thou cast those few sheep in the desert? I knew thy pride and the evil of thy heart, for in order to see the battle thou camest down.
And David will say, What did I now? is this not the word?
And he will turn round from his side to the front of another, and will say according to this word: and the people will turn back word as the former word.
And the words will be heard which David spake, and they will be announced before Saul, and he will take him.
And David will say to Saul, man's heart shall not fall on account of him; thy servant will go and fight with this one of the rovers.
And Saul will say to David, Thou wilt not be able to go against this of the rovers to war with him, for thou a boy, and he a man of war from his youth.
And David will say to Saul, Thy servant was feeding for his father among the sheep, and there came the lion and with the bear, and lifted up a sheep from the flock.
And I went forth after him, and I smote him, and I delivered from his mouth: and he arose upon me and I seized upon his beard, and I struck him and killed him.
Also the lion and the bear thy servant struck: and this uncircumcised of the rovers was as one of them, for he God, upbraided the ranks of the living.
And David will say, Jehovah who delivered me from the hand of the lion and from the hand of the bear, he will deliver me from the hand of this rover. And Saul will say to David, Go, and Jehovah shall be with thee.
And Saul will put his garments upon David, and give a helmet of brass upon his head, and put on him a coat of mail.
And David will gird his sword over his garments and begin to go, for he tried them not And David will say to Saul, I shall not be able to go with these, for I tried them not And David will take them away from off him.
And he will take his rod in his hand, and he will choose to him five smooth stones from the torrent, and he will put them in a vessel of the shepherds, which is to him, and in a sack; and his sling in his hand: and he will draw near to him of the rovers.
And he of the rovers going, went and drew near to David; and the man lifting up the shield before him.
And he of the rovers will look and will see David, and he will despise him, for he was a boy, and red, with a fair aspect.
And he of the rovers will say to David, Am I a dog that thou camnest to me with rods? and he of the rovers will curse David by his gods.
And he of the rovers will say to David, Come to me and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the cattle of the field.
And David will say to him of the rovers, Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, and I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the ranks of Israel, which thou didst upbraid.
This day Jehovah will deliver thee into my hand; and I smote thee and took away thy head from off thee, and I gave the carcass of the camp of the rovers this day to the birds of the heavens, and to the beasts of the earth: and all the earth shall know that there is a God to Israel.
And all this assembly shall know that not with sword and with spear Jehovah will save, for to Jehovah the battle, and he gave you into our hand.
And it was when he of the rovers arose, and he will come and draw near to meet David, and David will hasten and run to the array to meet him of the rovers.
And David will stretch forth his hand to the vessel and take from thence a stone and sling and strike him of the rovers into his forehead, and the stone will sink into his forehead; and he will fall upon his face to the earth.
And David will be strong upon him of the rovers with a sling and with a stone, and he will strike him of the rovers and kill him, and no sword in David's hand.
And David will run and stand upon the rover, and take his sword and draw it from its sheath, and kill him and cut off his head with it. And the rovers will see that their mighty one died, and they will flee.
And the men of Israel and Judah will rise and shout, and pursue the rovers till thy coming to the valley, and even to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the rovers will fall in the way of the gates, and even to Gath, and even to Ekron.
And the sons of Israel will turn back from pressing after the rovers, and they will plunder their camps.
And David will take the head of the rover, and bring it to Jerusalem; and he put his utensils in his tent.
And when Saul saw David going forth to meet the rover, he said to Abner, chief of the army, Whose son this boy, Abner? and Abner will say, Thy soul lives, O king, if I knew.
And the king will say, Ask thou whose son this youth.
And as David turned back from striking the rover, and Abner will take him and bring him before Saul, and the head of the rover in his hand.
And Saul will say to him, Whose son thou, O youth? And David will say, Thy servant the son of Jesse of the House of Bread.
And it will be as he finished to speak to Saul, and the soul of Jonathan was bound with the soul of David, and Jonathan will love him as his soul.
And Saul will take him in that day and he gave him not to turn back to the house of his father.
And Jonathan and David will cut out a covenant in his loving him as his soul.
And Jonathan will strip off the upper garment which is upon him and will give it to David, and his garments, and even to his sword, and even to his bow, and even to his girdle.
And David will go forth in all which Saul will send him, and he will be prudent: and Saul will set him over the men of war, and he will be good in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
And it will be in their coming, in David's turning back from the striking of the rover, and the women will come forth from all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing to meet Saul the king, with drums and with gladness and with triangles:
And the women will answer, playing, and they will say, Saul smote with his thousand and David with his ten thousands.
And it will kindle to Saul greatly, and this word will be evil in his eyes; and he will say, They gave to David ten thousands and to me they gave thousands, and yet to him but the kingdom.
And Saul will be wrong with David from that day and forward.
And it will be on the morrow, and the evil spirit of God will fall upon Saul, and he will prophesy in the midst of the house: and David playing with his hand as the day to day: and a spear in Saul's hand.
And Saul will lift up the spear, and say, I will strike against David into the wall And David will flee from before him twice.
And Saul will be afraid from the face of David, for Jehovah was with him, and he departed from Saul.
And Saul will remove him from him, and will set to him chief of a thousand; and he will go out and come in before the people.
And David will be prudent in all his ways; and Jehovah with him.
And Saul will see that he is prudent greatly, and he will be afraid of his face.
And all Israel and Judah loved David, for he will go out and come in before them.
And Saul will say to David, Behold, my daughter the great, Merab; her will I give to thee for wife; but be thou to me for a son of strength and fight the battles of Jehovah. And Saul said, My hand shall not be upon him, and the hand of the rovers shall be upon him.
And David will say to Saul, Who am I? and who was my father's family in Israel that I shall be son-in-law to the king?
And it will be in the time of giving Merab, Saul's daughter, to David, and he gave her to Adriel, the Meholathite, for wife,
And Michal, Saul's daughter, will love David: and they will announce to Saul, and the word was straight in his eyes.
And Saul will say, I will give her to him, and she shall be to him for a snare, and the hand of the rovers shall be against him. And Saul will say to David, In the second time thou shalt be son-in-law to me this day.
And Saul commanded his servants, Speak to David in secret, saying, Behold, the king delighted in thee, and all his servants loved thee: and now be son-in-law of the king.
And Saul's servants will speak in the ears of David these words. And David will say, Was it light in your eyes to be son-in-law to the king, and I a poor man and lightly esteemed?
And Saul's servants will announce to him, saying, According to these words spake David.
And Saul will say, Thus shall ye say to David, No delight to the king in a dowry, but in a hundred uncircumcisions of the rovers to be avenged of the king's enemies. And Saul purposed to cause David to fall into the hand of the rovers.
And his servants will announce to David these words, and the word will be straight in David's eyes, to be son-in-law to the king: and the days were not filled up.
And David will rise and will go, he and his men, and he will smite among the rovers two hundred men; and David will bring their uncircumcisions and they will complete them to the king, to be son-in-law to the king. And Saul will give to him Michal his daughter for wife.
And Saul will see and know that Jehovah is with David, and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
And Saul will add yet to be afraid from the face of David; and Saul will be an enemy with David all the days.
And the chiefs of the rovers will go forth: and it will be whenever they went forth, David was prudent above all the servants of Saul: and his name will be very precious.
And Saul will speak to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to kill David. And Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted in David greatly:
And Jonathan will announce to David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to kill thee: and at this time, watch now, in the morning, and dwell in secret and hide.
And I will go forth and stand by the hand of my father in the field where thou art there, and I will speak of thee to my father; and what I shall see I will announce to thee.
And Jonathan will speak good of David to Saul his father, and he will say to him, The king will not sin against his servant against David, for he sinned not against thee, and because of his doing good to thee greatly:
And he put his soul in his hand and smote the rover, and Jehovah will make great salvation to all Israel: thou sawest and thou wilt rejoice; and wherefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to kill David gratuitously?
And Saul will hear to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul will swear, Jehovah lives if he shall die.
And Jonathan will call for David, and Jonathan will announce to him all these words. And Jonathan will bring in David to Saul, and he will be before him as yesterday the third day.
And there will add to be war: and David will go forth and fight against the rovers, and will strike among them a great blow, and they will flee from his face.
And the evil spirit of Jehovah will be upon Saul, and he will sit in his house, and his spear in his hand: and David playing with his hand.
And Saul will seek to strike the spear into David and even into the wall: and he will slip away from the face of Saul, and he will strike the spear into the wall: and David fled, and he will escape in that night.
And Saul will send messengers to the house of David to watch him, and to kill him in the morning: and Michel his wife will announce to David, saying, If thou save not thy soul this night, to-morrow thou diest.
And Michal will let David down through the window: and he will go and flee, and escape.
And Michal will take a teraphim and put into the bed, and put a braiding of goat's hair at its head, and will cover with a garment.
And Saul will send messengers to take David, and she will say, He sick.
And Saul will send the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up in his bed to me to kill him.
And the messengers will come in, and behold, the teraphim in the bed, and the braiding of goats hair at its head.
And Saul will say to Michal, Wherefore didst thou deceive me thus? and wilt thou send away mine enemy and he will escape? And Michal will say to Saul, He said to me, Send me away; why shall I kill thee?
And David fled, and he will escape and will come to Samuel at Ramah, and he will announce to him all that Saul did to him. And he went, and Samuel, and they dwelt in Naioth.
And it will be announced to Saul, saying, Behold, David in Naioth in Ramah.
And Saul will send messengers to take David: and seeing the assembly of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, being set up over them, and the spirit of God will be upon Saul's messengers, and they will prophesy, also they.
And they will announce to Saul, and he will send other messengers, and they will prophesy, also they. And Saul will add and will send messengers the third time, and they will prophesy, also they.
And he also will go to Ramah, and he will come even to the great pit which is in Sechu: and he will ask and say, Where Samuel and David? And it will be said, Behold, in Naioth in Ramah.
And he will go there to Naioth in Ramah: and the spirit of God will be upon him, him also, and going, he will go and prophesy even till his coming into Naioth in Ramah.
And he will also strip off his garments and prophesy, he also, before Samuel; and he will fall naked all that day and all the night. For this they will say, Is Saul also among the prophets.
And David will flee from Naioth in Ramah, and he will come and say before Jonathan, What did I? and what mine iniquity? and what my sin before thy father that he seeks my soul?
And he will say to him, Far be it; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will not do a word great or a word small, and not disclose mine ear: and wherefore will my father hide from me this word? this is not.
And David will yet swear and say, Knowing, thy father knew that I found grace in thine eyes; and he will say, Jonathan shall not know this, lest he shall be grieved: but yet Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, for but a step between me and between death.
And Jonathan will say to David, What thy soul will say, and I will do for thee.
And David will say to Jonathan, Behold, the new moon to-morrow, and I sitting, shall sit down with the king to eat: and thou sentest me away and I was hid in the field till the evening of the third.
If reviewing, thy father shall review me, and thou saidst, Asking, David asked of me to run to the House of Bread, his city; for a sacrifice of days there to all the family.
If thus he shall say, Good; peace to thy servant; and if kindling, it shall kindle to him, know that evil was finished with him.
And do thou mercy with thy servant; for into a covenant of Jehovah thou didst bring thy servant with thee: and if there is iniquity in me, do thou kill me; and wherefore wilt thou bring me even to thy father?
And Jonathan will say, Far be it to thee: that if knowing, I shall know that evil was finished with my father to come upon thee, shall I not announce it to thee?
And David will say to Jonathan, Who shall announce to me? or what if thy father shall answer thee harshly?
And Jonathan will say to David, Come, and we will go forth to the field. And they two went forth to the field.
And Jonathan will say to David, Jehovah, God of Israel when I shall search out my father about this time to-morrow, the third day, and behold, good to David, and I shall not then send to thee, and uncover thine ear.
Thus shall Jehovah do to Jonathan, and thus shall he add; for it shall be good to my father with evil to thee, and I uncovered thine ear and sent thee away, and thou wentest in peace: and Jehovah will be with thee as he was with my father.
And not only while yet I live and wilt thou not do the mercy of Jehovah with me, and I shall not die.
And thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house, even forever: and not in Jehovah's cutting off the enemies of David a man from the face of the earth.
And Jonathan will cut out with the house of David, and Jehovah sought out from the hand of David's enemies.
And Jonathan will add to cause David to swear in his loving him; as loving his soul he loved him.
And Jonathan will say to him, To-morrow the new moon: and thou wert reviewed, for thy seat will be reviewed.
And the third day thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide there in the day of the work, and thou shalt sit by the stone of rolling:
And I will shoot three arrows of the side, to send to me for a mark.
And behold, I will send the boy: Go find the arrows. If saying, I say to the boy, Behold, the arrows from thee, and behold, take it: and come, for peace to thee, and not a word; Jehovah lives.
And if saying thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows from thee, and forward; go: for Jehovah sent thee away.

And David will hide in the field: and it will be the new moon, and the king will sit down to the bread to eat.
And the king will sit upon his seat as from time to time, to a seat of the wall: and Jonathan will rise, and Abner will sit by Saul's side, and David's seat will be reviewed.
And Saul spake not anything in that day, for he said, It is an accident; he is not clean; for he is not clean.
And on the morrow, of the month the second, and David's place will be reviewed: and Saul will say to Jonathan his son, Wherefore came not the son of Jesse also yesterday, also this day to the bread?
And Jonathan will answer to Saul, Asking, David asked of me even for the House of Bread:
And he will say, Send me away now, for a sacrifice of the family to us in the city; and my brother he commanded me: and now if I found grace in thine eyes, I will slip away now and see my brethren. For this he came not to the table of the king.
And Saul's anger will kindle against Jonathan, and he will say to him, Son of crooked rebelliousness, did I not know that thou choosest to the son of Jesse to thy shame and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?
For all the days which the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, thou shalt not stand, and thy kingdom. And now send and take him to me, for he is the son of death.
And Jonathan will answer Saul his father and say to him, Wherefore shall he die? What did he?
And Saul will lift up his spear against him to strike him, and Jonathan will know that it was finished from his father to kill David.

And it will be in the morning, and Jonathan will go forth to the field to the appointment, David and a small boy with him.
And he will say to the boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot The boy ran, and he shot the arrows beyond him.
And the boy will go even to the place of the arrows which Jonathan shot, and Jonathan will call after the boy and say, Is not the arrow from thee and forward?
And Jonathan will call after the boy, Be quick, hasten, thou shalt not stand. And Jonathan's boy will take up the arrows and come to his lord.
And the boy knew not anything: but Jonathan and David knew the word.
And Jonathan will give his utensils to the boy that is to him, and he will say to him, Go, bring into the city.
The boy went, and David rose from the south side, and fell upon his face to the earth, and they will worship three times, and they will kiss each his friend, and they will weep, each with his friend, till David magnified.
And Jonathan will say to David, Go for peace, for we sware, we two, in the name of Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will be between me and between thee, and between my seed and between thy seed, even forever. <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The original Julia E.

And say thus to him living, And peace with thee, and to thy house peace, and all which is to thee, peace.
And now I heard that shearers were to thee: now the shepherds which are to thee were with us, we harmed them not, and not anything was missing to them all the days of their being in Carmel.
Ask thy boys and they will announce to thee. And the boys will find favor in thine eyes, for upon a good day we come: wilt thou give now what thy hand shall find to thy servants, and to thy son David?
And David's boys will come and will speak to Nabal according to all these words in David's name, and they will rest.
And Nabal will answer David's servants, and say, Who is David? and who the son of Jesse? this day there were many servants breaking away a man from the face of his lord.

And the men were good to us exceedingly, and they harmed us not, and we missed not any thing all the days we went with them in our being in the field.
They were a wall to us, also the night, also the day, all the days we were with them feeding the sheep.
And now know and see what thou wilt do; for evil was finished against our lord and upon all his house: and he a son of Belial, from speaking to him.
And Abigail will hasten and take two hundred of bread, and two flasks of wine, and five sheep done, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put upon asses.
And she will say to her boys, Pass over before me; behold me coming after you. And she announced not to her husband Nabal.
And it was she rode upon the ass, and came down in the hiding of the mountain, and behold, David and his men coming down to meet her; and she will meet them.
(And David said, Surely in vain did I watch all which was to this one in the desert, and not any thing was missed from all which was to him; and he will turn back to me evil for good.
Thus will God do the enemies of David and thus will he add if I shall leave from all which is to him till the light of the morning, him pissing against the wall.)
And Abigail will see David, and will hasten, and will come down from the ass, and fall before David upon her face, and will worship him to the earth.
And she will fall at his feet and say, In me, my lord, me the iniquity; and thy servant now will speak in thine ears, and hear the words of thy servant.
Now my lord shall not set his heart to this man of Belial upon Nebel: for as his name, so is he: Nabal his name, and folly with him: and I thy servant saw not the boys of my lord which thou sentest.
And now my lord, Jehovah lives and thy soul lives, for Jehovah withheld thee from coming by blood, and saving thy hand to thyself, and now thine enemies shall be as Nabal, they seeking out evil to my lord.
And now this blessing which thy servant brought to my give it to the boys going at the feet of my lord.
Lift up now, to the trespass of thy servant: for making, Jehovah will make to my lord a faithful house; for Jehovah fought the battles of my lord, and evil shall not be found in thee thy days.
And a man will rise to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: and the soul of my lord was bound up in the bundle of lives with Jehovah thy God; and the soul of thine enemies he will sling out in the midst of the hand of the sling.
And it was that Jehovah will do to my lord according to all the good which he spake concerning thee, and he commanded thee for leader over Israel;
And this shall not be to thee for an obstacle and for a stumbling-block of heart to my lord, and to pour out blood gratuitously, and for my lord saving for himself: and the doing good of Jehovah to my lord, and remember thy servant.
And David will say to Abigail, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel who sent thee this day to meet me.
And blessed thy discernment, and blessed thou who finished me this day from coming for bloods, and my hand saving for me.
But yet Jehovah the God of Israel lives who withheld me from doing thee evil, for unless thou hastenedst and came to meet me, for if there was left to Nabal by the light of the morning him pissing against the wall.
And David will take from her hand what she brought to him, and he said to her, Go up for peace to thy house; see, I heard to thy voice, and I will lift up thy face.
And Abigail will go to Nabal; and behold, to him a drinking in his house as the drinking of a king; and Nabal's heart good with him, and he was intoxicated even greatly; and she announced not to him a word small and great till the light of the morning.
And it will be in the morning in the wine coming forth from Nabal, and his wife will announce to him these words, and his heart will die in the midst of him, and he was for a stone.
And it will be about ten days, and Jehovah will strike Nabal, and he will die.
And David will hear that Nabal died, and he will say, Blessed Jehovah who plead the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and held back his servant from evil: and the evil of Nabal Jehovah turned back upon his head. And David will send and will speak with Abigail to take her to him for wife.
And David's servants will come to Abigail to Carmel and will speak to her, saying, David sent us to thee to take thee to him for a wife.
And she will rise and worship with the face to the earth, and say, Behold, thy servant for a servant to wash the feet of my lord's servants.
And Abigail will hasten and rise, and ride upon the ass with five of her girls going at her feet; and she will go after David's messengers and she will be to him for a wife.

And the Ziphites will come to Saul to the hill, saying, Is not David hiding in the hill of Hachilah, upon the face of the desert?
And Saul will rise and go down to the desert of Ziph, and with him three thousand men the chosen of Israel, to seek out David in the desert of Ziph.
And Saul will encamp in the hill of Hachilah that is upon the face of the desert, upon the way; and David dwelt in the desert, and he will see that Saul came after him to the desert.
And David will send spies, and he knew that Saul came for a certainty.
And David will rise and come to the place where Saul encamped there: and David will see the place where Saul lay down there, and Abner son of Ner, chief of his army. And Saul lay down in the track, and the people encamping round about him.
And David will answer and say to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai will say, I will go down with thee.
And David will come, and Abishai, to the people by night; and behold, Saul lay sleeping in the track, and his spear pressed into the earth at his head: and Abner and the people sleeping round about him.
And Abishai will say to David, God shut up this day thine enemy in thy hand: and now, I will strike him now with the spear, and into the earth once, and I will not repeat to him.
And David will say to Abishai, Thou shalt not destroy him: for who stretching forth his hand against Jehovah's Messiah, and being innocent?
And David will say, Jehovah lives, for shall not Jehovah strike him? or his day shall come and he died; or he shall go down in the war and perish.
Far be it to me from Jehovah stretching forth my hand against Jehovah's Messiah: and now, take now the spear which is at his head, and the cruse of water, and we will go for ourselves.
And David will take the spear, and the cruse of water at Saul's head, and they will go for themselves, and none saw and none will know, and none waking: for all of them were sleeping; for a deep sleep of Jehovah fell upon them.
And David will pass over to the other side, and he will stand upon the head of the mountain from afar, and much place between them.
And David will call to the people and to Abner son of Ner, saying, Wilt thou not answer Abner? and Abner will answer and say, Who thou calling to the king?
And David will say to Abner, Art not thou a man? and who as thee in Israel? and why watched thou not to thy lord the king? for one of the people came to destroy the king thy lord.
This word was not good which thou didst Jehovah lives for ye the sons of death, for ye watched not over your lord, over Jehovah's Messiah And now see where is the king's spear and the cruse of water which was at his head.
And Saul will know David's voice, and he will say, Is this thy voice, my son David? and David will say, My voice, my lord the king.
And he will say, Wherefore this my lord pursued after his servant? for what did I? and what evil in my hand?
And now will my lord the king hear now the words of his servant? If Jehovah moved thee against me, he will smell a gift; and if the sons of man, cursed are they before Jehovah; for they drove me out this day from adjoining myself to the inheritance of Jehovah, saying. Go, serve other gods.
And now my blood shall not fall to the earth from before the face of Jehovah; for the king of Israel came forth to seek one flea, as when the partridge will pursue in the mountains.
And Saul will say, I sinned; turn back my son David: for I will no more, do to thee evil because that my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I was foolish, and I shall go very much astray.
And David will answer and say, Behold the king's spear: and will one of the boys pass over and take it?
And Jehovah will turn back to a man his justice and his truth; for Jehovah gave thee this day in hand, and I would not stretch forth my hand against Jehovah's Messiah.
And behold, as thy soul was magnified this day in mine eyes, so shall my soul be magnified in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will deliver me from all straits.
And Saul will say, to David, Blessed thou, my son David: also doing, thou shalt do, and also being able, thou shalt be able. And David will go to his way, and Saul turned back to his place.
And David will say in his heart, Now shall I be added one day into the hand of Saul: nothing good to me but escaping, I will escape into the land of the rovers; and Saul despairing to seek me farther in all the bound of Israel: and I was saved out of his hand.
And David will rise and pass over, he and six hundred men that are with him, to Achish, son of Maoch, king of Gath.
And David dwelt with Achish in Gath, he and his men, each in his house, David and his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal, the Carmelitess.
And it was announced to Saul that David fled to Gath; and he will no more add to seek him.
And David will say to Achish, If now I found grace in thine eyes, will they give me a place in one city of the field, and I will dwell there: and why shall thy servant dwell in the city of the kingdom with thee?
And Achish will give to him in that day Ziklag; for this Ziklag was to the kings of Judah, even to this day.
And the number of days which David dwelt in the field of the rovers will be days and four months.
And David will go up, and his men, and will plunder against the Geshurites and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: and behold, the inhabitants of the land which were of old thy going to Shur, and even to the land of Egypt.
And David struck the land, and will not save alive a man and woman; and he took the sheep and oxen, and asses and camels, and garments, and he will turn back and come to Achish.
And Achish will say, Did ye not plunder this day? and David will say, Upon the south of Judah, and upon the south of the Jerahmeelite, and to the south of the Kenite.
And David will not preserve alive a man and woman to bring to Gath, saying, Lest they shall announce against us, saying, Thus did David, and thus his judgment all the days which he dwelt in the field of the rovers.
And Achish will believe in David, saying, Becoming loathsome, he became loathsome with his people, with Israel; and he shall be to me for servant forever.
And it will be in those days, and the rovers will gather their camps together for war to fight against Israel. And Achish will say to David, Knowing, thou shalt know that with me thou shalt go forth with the camp, thou and thy men.
And David will say to Achish, For this thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Achish will say to David, For this I will set thee a watcher for my head all the days.
And Samuel died, and all Israel will lament for him; and they will bury him in Ramah, and in his city. And Saul took away the necromancers and the wizards from the land.
And the rovers will gather together, and will come and encamp in Shunem: and Saul will gather together all Israel, and they will encamp in Gilboa.
And Saul will see the camp of the rovers, and he will fear and his heart will tremble greatly.
And Saul will ask through Jehovah, and Jehovah answered him not, also in dreams, also in Lights, also in the prophets.
And Saul will say to his servants, Seek out for me a woman, mistress of necromancy, and I will go to her and inquire of her. And his servants will say to him, Behold, a woman mistress of necromancy in the Fountain of Dor.
And Saul will disguise himself, and will put on other garments, and will go, and two men with him, and he will come to the woman by night: and he will say, Divine to me now, by necromancy, and bring up to me whom I say to thee.
And the woman will say to him, Behold, thou knewest what Saul did who cut off the necromancers, and the wizards, from the land; wherefore art thou laying snares for my soul to kill me?
And Saul will swear to her by Jehovah, saying, Jehovah lives, if iniquity shall pierce thee upon this word.
And the woman will say, Whom shall I bring up to thee? And he will say, Bring up to me Samuel.
And the woman will see Samuel, and she will cry out, with a great voice: and the woman will say to Saul, saying, Why didst thou deceive me? and thou Saul.
And the king will say to her, Thou shalt not fear: What sawest thou? And the woman will say to Saul, I saw gods coming up out of the earth.
And he will say to her, What his form? And she will say, An old man coming up, and he covered with an upper garment. And Saul knew that he Samuel, and he will bow his face to the earth and worship him.
And Samuel will say to Saul, Why didst thou disturb me to bring me up? And Saul will say, Distress to me greatly: and the rovers warring against me, and God departed from me, and he answered me no more, also by the hand of the prophets, also by dreams: and I will call to thee to make known to me what I shall do.
And Samuel will say, Why wilt thou ask of me, and Jehovah departed from thee and he will be thine enemy?
And Jehovah will do for him as he spake by my hand, and Jehovah will rend the kingdom from thy hand and give it to thy neighbor, to David.
As thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah, and didst not the anger of his wrath against Amalek, for this, Jehovah did this word to thee this day.
And Jehovah will give also Israel with thee into the hand of the rovers; and to-morrow thou and thy sons with me, also the camp of Israel Jehovah will give into the hand of the rovers.
And Saul will hasten and fall with the fulness of his stature to the earth, and he will fear greatly from the words of Samuel: also strength was not in him, for he ate not bread all the day and all the night.
And the woman will come to Saul, and she will see that he trembled greatly, and she will say to him, Behold, thy servant heard to thy voice, and I will put my soul in my hand, and heard thy words which thou spake to me.
And now, hear now, also thou to the voice of thy servant, and I will set before thee a bit of bread; and eat and strength will be in thee that thou shalt go in the way.
And he will refuse, and say, I will not eat And his servants will press upon him, and also the woman, and he will hear to their voice. And he will rise up from the earth and sit upon the bed.
And to the woman a calf of the stall in the house; she will haste and sacrifice it, and take flour and knead and bake it unleavened.
And she will bring near before Saul, and before his servants; and they will eat, and rise and go away in that night.
And the rovers will gather together all their camp to Aphek: and Israel encamping by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
And the princes of the rovers passing over by hundreds and by thousands: and David and his men passing over at last with Achish.
And the chiefs of the rovers will say, What these Hebrews? and Achish will say to the chiefs of the rovers, Is not this David, servant of Saul king of Israel, who was with me these days or these years, and I found nothing in him from the day of his falling till this day.
And the chiefs of the rovers will be angry with him; and the chiefs of the rovers will say to him, Cause this man to turn back, and he shall turn back to his place which thou didst set him there, and he shall not go down with us in the war, and he shall not be to us for an adversary in the war: and with what shall this satisfy to his lord? is it not with the heads of these men?
Is not this David which they will answer to him in dances, saying, Saul struck his thousands and David his ten thousands?
And Achish will call for David and say to him, Jehovah lives, for thou wert straight and good in mine eyes, thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp, for I found not evil in thee from the day of thy coming to me even to this day: and in the eyes of the princes thou art not good.
And now turn back and go in peace, and thou wilt not do evil in the eyes of the princes of the rovers.
And David will say to Achish, But what did I? and what didst thou find in thy servant from the day I was before thee, even to this day, that I shall not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
And Achish will answer and say to David, I knew that thou art good in mine eyes as a messenger of God: but the chiefs of the rovers said, He shall not go up with us in the war.
And now rise early in the morning and the servants of thy lord which came with thee: and ye rising early in the morning, and the light to you, and go.
And David will rise early, he and his men, to go in the morning to turn back to the land of the rovers. And the rovers went up to Jezreel.
And it will be in the going up of David to Ziklag, and his men, in the third day, and the Amalekites plundered to the south, and to Ziklag, and they will strike Ziklag and burn it with fire.
And they will take the women captive who are in it: from small and even to great they slew not a man, and they will lead away and go to their way.
And David will come, and his men, to the city, and behold, it burnt with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive.
And David will lift up, and the people with him, their voice, and they will weep till power was not in them to weep.
And the two wives of David were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
And it will press upon David greatly, for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was bitter, each for his sons and for his daughters: and David will be strengthened in Jehovah his God.
And David will say to Abiathar the priest, son of Ahimelech, Bring now near to me the ephod. And Abiathar will bring near the ephod to David.
And David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I hedge it in? and he will say, Pursue: and hedging, thou shalt hedge in, and taking away, thou shalt take away.
And David will go, and six hundred men which were with him, and they will come to the torrent of Bezor, and those remaining, stood.
And David will pursue, he and four hundred men: and two hundred men will stand, which were faint from passing over the torrent of Bezor.
And they will find a man, an Egyptian, in the field, and they will take him to David, and they will give to him bread, and he will eat; and they will give him water to drink;
And they will give to him a piece of a cake of dried figs and two bunches of dried grapes: and he will eat and his spirit will turn back to him, for he ate not bread and drank not water three days and three nights.
And David will say to him, To whom thou? and from whence thou? and the boy, the Egyptian, will say, I servant to a man, an Amalekite; and my lord left me because I was sick the the third day.
We plundered the south of the Cherethite, and upon that to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and Ziklag we burnt with fire.
And David will say to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this troop? And he will say, Swear to me by God if thou wilt kill me, and if thou wilt deliver me into the hand of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.
And he will bring him down, and behold them spread out upon the face of all the earth, eating and drinking and keeping a festival, for all the great spoil which they took from the land of the rovers, and from the land of Judah.
And David will smite them from the dawn and even to the evening to their morrow: and a man escaped not from them, except four hundred men of youth who rode upon camels, and they will flee.
And David will deliver all that Amalek took: and David took away his two wives.
And nothing was wanting to them from small even to great, and even to sons and daughters, and spoil, and even to all which they took to them: David turned back all.
And David will take all the sheep and the oxen they drove before those cattle, and they will say, This David's spoil.
And David will come to the two hundred men which were faint from going after David, and they will cause them to dwell by the torrent of Bezor: and they will come forth to meet David and to meet the people which are with him: and David will draw near to the people and will ask to them of peace.
And every evil man will answer, and Belial, of the men who went with David, and they will say, Because they went not with me, we will not give to them of the spoil which we took away, except each his wife and his sons, and they shall lead and go.
And David will say, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with what Jehovah gave to us, and he will watch us and give the troop coming against us into our hand.
And who will hear to you for this word? for as the part of him going clown in the war, and so the part of him sitting by the vessels: together shall they divide.
And it will be from that day and over, and he will set it for a law and for a judgment to Israel even to this day.
And David will come to Ziklag, and he will send from the spoil to the old men of Judah, to his neighbors, saving, Behold, to you a blessing from the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah.
To those in Bethel, and to those in south Ramah, and to those in Jattir,
And to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa.
And to those in Rachel, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,
And to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-Ashan, and to those in Athach,
And to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David went about there, he and his men.
And the rovers warred against Israel: and the men of Israel will flee from the face of the rovers, and they will fall wounded in mount Gilboa.
And the rovers will stick fast to Saul and his sons; and the rovers will strike Jonathan and Abinadab and Melchisua, Saul's sons.
And the war will be heavy to Saul, and the archers, men with the bow, will find him; and he will be greatly wounded from the archers.
And Saul will say to him lifting up his arms, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised shall come and thrust me through and mock upon me. And he lifting up his arms would not, for he will fear greatly; and Saul will take the sword and will fall upon it.
And he lifting up his arms will fear, for he saw Saul died; and he will fall, also he, upon his sword, and he will die with him.
And Saul will die, and his three sons, and he lifting up his arms, also all his men in that day together.
And the men of Israel will see, who are on the the other side of the valley, and who are on the other side of Jordan, that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul died and his sons, and they will leave their cities, and flee; and the rovers will come and dwell in them.
And it will be on the morrow, and the rovers will come to strip the wounded, and they will find Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
And they will cut off his head, and they will strip off his arms, and send into the land of the rovers round about, to announce good news to the house of their images and to the people.
And they will put up his arms in the house of Ashtaroth: and his body they will hang up upon the wall of the House of Quiet.
And the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead will hear concerning him what the rovers did to Saul,
And they will rise, every man of strength, and go all night and take the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the walls of the House of Quiet, and come to Jabesh, and burn them there.
And they will take their bones and bury under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they will fast seven days.
And it will be after the death of Saul, and David turned back from striking Amalek, and David sat down two days in Ziklag.
And it will be in the third day, and behold, a man came from the camp from Saul, and his garments rent and dust upon his head: and it will be in his coming to David and he will fall to the earth and worship him.
And David will say to him, From whence wilt thou come? and he will say to him, From the camp of Israel I escaped.
And David will say to him, What was the word? announce now to me. And he will say that the people fled from the battle, and also many fell from the people, and they will die and also Saul and Jonathan his son died.
And David will say to the youth announcing to him, How knewest thou that Saul died, and Jonathan his son?
And the youth announcing to him, will say, And happening, I happened to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaning upon his spear; and behold, the chariots and lords, the horsemen, pursued him.
And he will look behind him and see me, and he will call to me; and I say, Behold me.
And he will say to me, Who thou? and I shall say to him, I an Amalekite.
And he will say to me, Stand now, upon me, and kill me, for perplexity seized me because my soul is yet all in me.
And I shall stand upon him and kill him, for I knew that he will not live after his falling: and I shall take the diadem which upon his head, and the armband which upon his arm, and I shall bring them hither to my lord.
And David will take hold upon his garments and will rend them; and also all the men which are with him.
And they will mourn and weep, and fast, even till the evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah and for the house of Israel, because they fell by the sword.
And David will say to the youth announcing to him, From whence thou? and he will say, I the son of a man, a stranger, an Amalekite.
And David will say to him, How, wert thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy Jehovah's Messiah?
And David will call to one of his youths and say, Come near, fall upon him. And he will strike him, and be will die.
And David will say to him, Thy bloods upon thy head, for thy mouth answered against thee, saying, I killed Jehovah's Messiah.
And David will set up this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
(And he will say to teach the sons of Judah the bow: it was written upon the book of Jasher.)
The beauty of Israel was wounded upon thy heights: how have the powerful fallen.
Ye shall not announce in Gath, ye shall not announce the good news in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the rovers shall rejoice--lest the daughters of the uncircumcised shall exult.
Mountains of Gilboa, no dew and no rain upon you, and fields of offerings: for there the shield of the powerful was cast away--the shield of Saul as not anointed with oil.
From the blood of the wounded and from the fat of the powerful, the bow of Jonathan drew not back in the rear, and the sword of Saul will not turn back empty.
Saul and Jonathan beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not separated: they were swift above eagles, they were strong above lions.
Daughters of Israel weep for Saul, having clothed you with scarlet, with delights; bringing up ornaments of gold upon your garments.
How have the powerful fallen in the midst of the battle Jonathan wounded upon the heights!
Distress to me for thee, my brother Jonathan: thou wert sweet to me exceedingly: thy love to me was wonderful above the love of women.
How have the powerful fallen and the vessels of war perished.
And it will be after this, and David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah? and Jehovah will say to him, Go up. And David will say, Whither shall I go up? and he will say, To Hebron.
And David will go up there, and also his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
And his men which were with him David brought up with him each, and his house: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
And the men of Judah will come and will anoint there David for king over the house of Judah. And they will announce to David, saying, The men of Jabesh-Gilead that buried Saul.
And David will send messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and he will say to them, Blessed ye to Jehovah, who did this mercy with your lord, with Saul, and ye will bury him.
And now Jehovah will do with you mercy and truth: and I also will do you this good, because ye did this word.
And now your hands shall be strengthened, and be ye for sons of strength: for Saul your lord died, and also the house of Judah anointed me for king over them.
And Abner, son of Ner, the chief of the army which was to Saul, took a man of shame, son a Saul, and he will cause him to pass over to Mahanaim;
And he will make him king to Gilead, and to the Ashurite and to Jezreel, and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over all Israel.
The son of forty years, the man of shame, son of Saul, in his reigning over Israel; and two years he reigned: but the house of Judah was after David.
And the number of days which David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah, will be seven years and six months.
And Abner son of Ner, will go forth and the servants of the man of shame, son of Saul, from the two camps to the hill.
And Joab son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, will go forth and meet them at the pool of Gibeon together: and these will sit by the pool from hence, and those by the pool from thence.
And Abner will say to Joab, Now shall the boys arise and play before us. And Joab will say, They shall arise.
And they will rise and pass over by number, twelve to Benjamin, and to the man of shame, son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.
And they will seize each upon the head of his neighbor, and his sword in the side of his neighbor, and they will fall together: and he will call, that place Helkath-Hazurim, which is in Gibeon.
And the war will be hard even exceedingly, in that day; and Abner will be smitten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
And there will be there three sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was swift in his feet as one of the roes which are in the field.
And Asahel will pursue after Abner; and he turned not to the right or to the left from after Abner.
And Abner will look behind him and say, This thou Asahel? And he will say, I.
And Abner will say to him. Turn to thyself to the right or to the left, and take hold for thyself from the boys and take to thee his spoils. And Asahel would not turn aside from after him.
And Abner will add yet to say to Asahel, Turn aside for thyself from after me: wherefore shall I strike thee to the earth? and how shall I lift up my face to Joab thy brother?
And he will refuse to turn aside: and Abner will strike him with the extremity of the spear in the belly, and the spear will come forth from behind him, and he will fall there and die in his place: and it will be, all coming to the place where Asahel fell there and he will die, and they will stand.
And Joab and Abishai will pursue after Abner: and the sun went down and they came even to the hill of terror, which was by the face of Giah, the way of the desert of Gibeon.
And the sons of Benjamin will gather together after Abner, and they will be for one band, and they will stand upon the head of one hill.
And Abner will call to Joab and say, Shall the sword consume forever? knewest thou not that it will be bitter at the last? and how long wilt thou not say to the people to turn back from after their brethren?
And Joab will say, God lives if thou spakest not, for then from the morning the people went up, each from after his brother.
And Joab will strike upon the trumpet, and all the people will stand, and no more pursue after Israel, and they will no more add to fight.
And Abner and his men went in the sterile region all that night, and they will pass over Jordan and will go to all Bithron, and will come to the two camps.
And Joab turned back from after Abner: and he will gather all the people together and they will review from the servants of David nineteen men and Asahel.
And the servants of David struck from Benjamin and upon the men of Abner, three hundred and sixty men died.
And they will lift up Asahel and bury him in the grave of his father, which was in the House of Bread. And Joab and his men will go all night and it will shine to them in Hebron.
And long war will be between the house of Saul and between the house of David: and David went and was strengthened, and the house of Saul went and was weakened.
And sons will be born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn will be Amnon to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess.
And his second, Chileab, to Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, son of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.
And the fourth, Adonijah, son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital.
And the sixth, Ithream, to Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
And it will be in there being war between the house of Saul and between the house of David, and Abner was strong for the house of Saul.
And to Saul a concubine, and her name Rizpah, daughter of Aiah: and he will say to Abner, Wherefore wentest thou in to my father's concubine?
And it will kindle to Abner greatly for the words of the man of shame, and he will say, Am I the head of a dog which against Judah this day will do mercy with the house of Saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends, and not delivering thee into the hand of David, and thou wilt review over me concerning the woman this day?
Thus will God do to Abner, and thus will he add to him, for as Jehovah sware to David that thus I will do to him:
To cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath.
And he was not able to turn back Abner a word from his fearing him.
And Abner will send messengers to David for his sake, saying, To whom the land? saying, Cut out thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand with thee to turn about to thee all Israel.
And he will say, Good; I will cut out with thee a covenant: but one word I ask from thee, saying, Thou shalt not see my face if before thy bringing Michal, Saul's daughter, in thy coming to see my face.
And David will send messengers to the man of shame, son of Saul, saying, Thou shalt give my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to me for a hundred uncircumcisions of the rovers.
And the man of shame will send and take her from the man Phaltiel, son of Laish.
And her husband went with her, going and weeping after her even to Bahurim. And Abner will say to him, Go, turn back And he will turn back.
And a word of Abner was with the old men of Israel, saying, Also yesterday also the third day ye were seeking David for king over you.
And now do; for Jehovah said to David, saying, By the hand of David my servant I saved my people from the hand of the rovers, and from the hand of all their enemies.
And Abner will speak also in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner will also go to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all which was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.
And Abner will come to David to Hebron, and with him twenty men: and David will make to Abner and to the men with him a drinking.
And Abner will say to David, I will arise and go and gather to my lord the king, all Israel, and they shall cut out with thee a covenant, and thou didst reign over all that thy soul shall desire. And David will send away Abner, and he will go in peace.
And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from the troop, and they brought with them much spoil: and Abner not with David in Hebron, for he sent him away, and he went in peace.
And Joab and all the army which was with him came, and they will announce to Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he will send him away, and he will go in peace.
And Joab will come to the king and he will say, What didst thou? behold, Abner came to thee; wherefore this thou sentest him away, and going, he went?
Thou knewest Abner son of Ner, for to deceive thee he came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all which thou doest.
And Joab will go forth from David and send messengers after Abner, and they will turn him back from the Well of Sirah: and David knew not.
And Abner will turn back to Hebron, and Joab will turn him away to the midst of the gate to speak with him in quiet, and he will strike him there in the belly, and he will die for the blood of Asahel his brother.
And David will hear from after this, and he will say, I am innocent, and my kingdom, with Jehovah even forever, from the bloods of Abner son of Ner.
It will stay upon the head of Joab and to all the house of his father; and there shall not be cut off from the house of Joab, him flowing, and the leprous, and him holding fast upon a staff, and him falling upon a sword, and him diminished in bread.
And Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner because be slew Asahel their brother in Gibeon in war.
And David will say to Joab and to all the people which were with him, Rend your garments and gird you with sack-cloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David went after the litter.
And they will bury Abner in Hebron: and the king will lift up his voice and weep at the grave of Abner; and all the people will weep.
And the king will lament for Abner, and he will say, As the fool died will Abner die?
Thy hands not bound, and thy feet were not joined to fetters as falling before the sons of iniquity thou fellest. And all the people will add to weep over him.
And all the people will come to cause David to eat bread, while yet day. And David will swear, saying, Thus will God do to me, and thus will he add, if before the going down of the sun I shall taste bread or anything.
And all the people knew, and it will be good in their eyes, as all the king did was good in the eyes of all the people.
And all the people knew, and all Israel, in that day, that it was not from the king to kill Abner son of Ner.
And the king will say to his servants, Will ye not know that a chief and a great one fell this day in Israel?
And I this day tender, and being anointed king; and these men sons of Zeruiah, hard for me. Jehovah will recompense to him doing evil according to his evil.
And Saul's son will hear that Abner died in Hebron, and his hands will be relaxed, and all Israel trembled.
And two men, chiefs of troops, were to the son of Saul: the name of the one, Baanah, and the name of the second, Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin, for also Beeroth was reckoned to Benjamin.
And the Beerothites will flee to Gittaim, and they will be sojourners there till this day.
And to Jonathan, Saul's son, a son smitten in the feet: he was the son of five years in the news coming of Saul and Jonathan from Jezreel, and his nurse will lift him up and flee: and it will be in her springing up to flee, and he will fall, and he will be lame: and his name Mephibosheth.
And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, will go, and they will come about the heat of the day to the house of the man of shame; and he lay down upon the bed at noon.
And behold, they came even to the midst of the house, taking wheat; and they will strike him in the belly; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
And they will come to the house, and he will lie upon his couch in his bed-chamber, and they will strike him and kill him, and take away his head, and they will take his head and go the way of the sterile region all night.
And they will bring the head of the man of shame to David to Hebron, and they will say to the king, Behold the head of the man of shame, son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy soul; and Jehovah will give to my lord the king vengeance this day of Saul and of his seed.
And David will answer Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he will say to them, Jehovah lives who redeemed my soul from all straits,
When he announcing to me, saying, Behold, Saul died; and he was in his eyes as announcing good news; and I shall seize upon him and kill him in Ziklag, which I gave to him for the good news:
Much more when wicked men killed a just man in his house upon his bed; and now shall I not seek out his blood from your hand and take you away from the earth?
And David will command the boys and they will kill them and cut off their hands and their feet, and hang them over the pain Hebron. And the head of Ishbosheth they took and they will bury it in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
And all the tribes of Israel will come to David to Hebron, and they will say, saying, Behold us thy bone and thy flesh.
Also yesterday, also the third day, in Saul being king over us, thou wert bringing out and bringing in Israel And Jehovah will say to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be for leader over Israel.
And all the old men of Israel will come to the king to Hebron; and king David will cut out for them a covenant in Hebron before Jehovah, and they will anoint David for king over Israel.

And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
And the rovers will hear that they anointed David for king over Israel, and all the rovers will come up to seek David; and David will hear and he will go down to the fastness.

And David will ask in Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the rovers? wilt thou give them into my hand? and Jehovah will say to David, Go up: for giving, I will give the rovers into thy hand.
And David will come against the Lord of Breaches, and David will strike them there, and he will say, Jehovah broke down mine enemies before me as the breach of waters: for this he called the name of that place, the Lord of the Breaches.
And they will leave there their images, and David and his men will take them away.
And the rovers will add yet to come up, and they will be dispersed in the valley of Rephaim.
And David will ask in God, and he will say, Thou shalt not go up: turn about behind them and thou shalt cover against them from before the weepings.
And it shall be in thy hearing the voice of the going in the heads of the weepings, then thou shalt be active, for then Jehovah will go forth before thee to strike upon the camp of the rovers.
And David will do thus as Jehovah commanded him, and he will strike the rovers from Geba even to thy coming to Gazer.
And David will yet gather together all the chosen in Israel, thirty thousand.
And David will rise and go and all the people which were with him from the lords of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God which the name was called the name of Jehovah of armies sitting the cherubims over it.

And it will kindle to David because Jehovah broke a breach upon Uzzah: and he will call that place the Breach of Uzzah, even to this day.
And David was afraid of Jehovah in that day, and he will say, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
And David would not remove to him the ark of Jehovah to the city of David: and David will turn it to the house of the servant of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
And the ark of Jehovah will dwell in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months: and Jehovah will bless Obed-Edom and all his house.
And it will be announced to king David, saying, Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all which is to him, on account of the ark of God. And David will go and bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the city of David with joy.

And they will bring in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place in the midst of the tent which David stretched out for it: and David will bring up a burnt-offering before Jehovah and peace.
And David will finish bringing up the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bless the people in the name of Jehovah of armies.
And he will distribute to all the people to every sort of Israel, from man and even to woman, to each one cake of bread, and one measure, and one cake: and all the people will go each to his house.
And David turned back to bless his house. And Michal, Saul's daughter, will go forth to the meeting of David, and she will say, How honored the king of Israel this day who was uncovered this day to the eyes of the maids of his servants as one of the worthless uncovering was uncovered!
And David will say to Michal, Before Jehovah who chose in me above thy father and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Jehovah, over Israel: and I played before Jehovah.
And I was vile yet above this and I was humbled in mine eyes, and with the maids of which thou spakest with them I shall be honored.
And to Michal, Saul's daughter, there was no child to her even to the day of her death.
And it will be when the king sat in his house, and Jehovah gave rest to him from round about from all his enemies.
And the king will say to Nathan the prophet, See now, me dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of God dwelling in midst of the curtains.
And Nathan will say to the king, All which, is in thy heart, do; for Jehovah is with thee.
And it will be in that night, and the word of Jehovah will be to Nathan, saying,
Go and say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah, Shalt thou build me an house for my resting?
For I dwelt not in a house from the day I brought up the sons of Israel from Egypt even to this day, and I shall be going in a tent and in a dwelling.
And in all where I went among all the sons of Israel spake I a word with one of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why built ye not to me a house of cedars?
And now thus shalt thou say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of armies, I took thee from quiet, from after the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
And I will be with thee in all where thou wilt go, and I will cut off all thine enemies from thy face, and I made to thee a great name as the name of the great which are upon the earth.
And I set a place for my people, for Israel, and I planted him and he dwelt in his place, and he shall be no more moved; and the sons of iniquity shall not add to humble him as in the beginning.
And from the day I commanded judges over my people Israel, and I gave rest to thee from all thine enemies. And Jehovah announced to thee that Jehovah will make to thee a house.
When thy days shall be filled up and thou shalt lie down with thy fathers, and I raised up thy seed after thee which shall come forth thy bowels, and I prepared his kingdom.
He shall build a house for my name, and I set the throne of his kingdom even to forever.
I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son; who in his sinning I struck him with the rod of men, and with the blows of the sons of men.
And my mercy I will not remove from him as I removed from Saul whom I removed from thy face.
And thy house was firm and thy kingdom even to forever before thee; thy throne shall be prepared even to forever.
According to all these words and according to all this vision so spake Nathan to David.
And king David will come and sit before Jehovah, and say, Who am I Lord Jehovah? and who my house that thou broughtest me even to these?
And this yet will be small in thine eyes, Lord Jehovah; and thou wilt speak also to the house of thy servant for remoteness. And this the law of man, Lord Jehovah?
And what shall David yet add to speak to thee? for thou knewest thy servant, Lord Jehovah.
For sake of thy word and according to thy heart thou didst all this greatness to make thy servant know.
For this thou wert great, Jehovah God: for none as thee, for no God beside thee according to all we heard in our ears.
And who as thy people, as Israel, one nation in the earth whom God went to redeem to him for a people, and to set up for him a name, and to do for you greatness and wonderful things for thy land from the face of thy people whom thou didst redeem to thee from Egypt, nations and his tents.
And thou wilt prepare to thyself thy people Israel to thee for a people, even to forever. And thou Jehovah wert to them for God.
And now, Jehovah God the word that thou spakest concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, set up even to forever, and do as thou spakest.
And thy name shall be great even to forever, saying, Jehovah of armies the God over Israel: and the house of thy servant David shall be prepared before thee.
For thou, Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, thou didst open the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build to thee an house: for this thy servant found his heart to pray to thee this prayer.
And now, Lord Jehovah, thou that God, and thy words shall be true, and thou wilt speak to thy servant this goodness.
And now be willing and bless the house of thy servant to be forever before thee: for thou, Lord Jehovah, spakest: and from thy blessing the house of thy servant shall be blessed forever.

Also king David consecrated them to Jehovah with the silver and the gold, which he consecrated from all the nations which he subdued:
From Aram, and from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, and from the rovers, and from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

And the chiefs of the sons of Ammon will say to Hanun their lord, Is David honoring thy father in thine eyes, that he sent comforters to thee? is it not for the sake of searching out the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it, David sent his servants to thee?
And Hanun will take David's servants, and shave half their beard, and cut off their garments in the half, even to their buttocks, and he will send them away.

And David will say to Uriah, Go down to thy house and wash thy feet And Uriah will go forth from the house of the king and a loan of the king will go forth after him.
And Uriah will lie at the door of the house of the king with all the servants of his lord, and will not go down to his house.
And they will announce to David, saying Uriah went not down to his house; and David will say to Uriah, Camest thou not from the way? wherefore wentest thou not down to thy house?
And Uriah will say to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, dwell in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamping upon the face of the field; and shall I come into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? Thee living and thy soul living, if I shall do this word.
And David will say to Uriah, Dwell here also this day, and to-morrow I will send thee away. And Uriah dwelt in Jerusalem in that day and from the morrow.

And it will be in Joab's watching the city, and he will give Uriah to the place where he knew that strong men were there.
And the men of the city will go forth and fight with Joab: and there will fall of the people from the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite also will die.
And Joab will send and announce to David all the words of the war;
And be will command the messenger, saying, When thou finishest all the words of the war to speak to the king,
And it being if the wrath of the king shall go up, and he say to thee, Wherefore drew ye near to the city to fight? did ye not know that they cast from above the wall?
Who struck Abimelech, son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast upon him a piece of the upper millstone from above the wall, and he will die in Thebez? Wherefore drew ye near to the wall? And say thou, Also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.
And the messenger will go, and come and announce to David all that for which Joab sent him.
And the messenger will say to David, That the men were strengthened upon us, and they came out to us to the field, and they were upon them, even to the door of the gate.
And they beholding, aimed at thy servants from above the wall: and from the servants of the king will die, and also thy servant, Uriah the Hittite died.
And David will say to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, This same word shall not be evil in thine eyes, as this, and as this, the sword shall consume: strengthen thy battle against the city and pull it down: and strengthen yourselves.
And Uriah's wife will hear that Uriah her husband died, and she will mourn for her lord.
And the mourning will pass over, and David will send and take her to his house, and she will be to him for wife, and bear to him a son. And the word which David did will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And Jehovah will send Nathan to David. And he will come in to him and say to him, Two men were in one city; one rich and one poor.
To the rich was sheep and oxen exceeding many:
And to the poor, not anything except one little ewe lamb which he found, and he will save it alive: and it will grow with him and with his sons together; it will eat from his morsel and will drink from his cup, and will lie in his bosom, and be to him as a daughter.
And a traveler will come to the rich man, and he will spare to take from his sheep and from his oxen to do for the wayfarer coming to him; and he will take the poor man's ewe lamb and do for the man coming to him.
And David's anger will kindle against the man greatly, and he will say to Nathan, Jehovah lives, for the man doing this is the son of death.
And the ewe lamb he shall requite four-fold, because he did this word, and because he spared not.
And Nathan will say to David, Thou the man. Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, I anointed thee for king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;
And I will give thee the house of thy lord and thy lord's wives into thy bosom, and I will give to thee the house of Israel and Judah; and if little, I will add to thee according to these and according to these.
Wherefore didst thou despise the word of Jehovah to do evil in his eyes? Uriah the Hittite thou didst strike with the sword, and his wife thou tookest to thee for a wife, and thou didst kill him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
And now the sword shall not depart from thy house even to forever; because that thou didst despise me, and thou wilt take the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be to thee for wife.
Thus said Jehovah, Behold me raising up evil against thee from thy house, and I took thy wives before thine eyes and gave to thy neighbor, and he lay with thy wives before the eyes of this sun.
For thou didst in secret: and I will do this word before all Israel, and before the sun.
And David will say to Nathan, I sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan will say to David, Jehovah also passed over thy sin; thou shalt not die.
Only that despising, thou didst cause the enemies of Jehovah to despise by this thing, also the son born to thee, dying, shall die.
And Nathan will go to his house. And Jehovah will strike the child which Uriah's wife bare to David and he will be sick.
And David will seek God for the boy, and fast a fast; and he came and passed the night and lay upon the earth.
And the old men of his house will rise to him to lift him up from the earth; and he would not, and he ate not bread with them.
And it will be in the seventh day, and the child will die. And David's servants feared to announce to him that the child died: for they said, Behold, in the child being living we spake to him and he heard not to our voice, and how shall we say to him the child died, and do evil?
And David will see that his servants are whispering, and David will perceive that the child died: and David will say to his servants, Did the child die? and they will say, He died.
And David will rise from the earth and wash, and be anointed, and he will change his garments, and will go into the house of Jehovah and worship, and go to his house; and he will ask and they will set bread to him, and he will eat.
And his servants will say to him, What this word which thou didst? for sake of the child living thou didst fast and weep, and when the child died thou didst rise and thou wilt eat bread.
And he will say, The child yet living, and I fasted and wept; for I said, Who will know Jehovah will compassionate me, and the child live?
And now he died, wherefore thus do I fast? shall I be able to yet turn him back? I go to him, and he will not turn back to me.
And David will comfort Bath-Sheba his wife, and will go in to her and lie with her, and she will bear a son, and he will call his name Solomon: and Jehovah loved him.
And he will send by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he will call his name Jedidiah, for sake of Jehovah.
And Joab will fight against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and he will take the city of the kingdom.
And Joab will send messengers to David, and say, I fought against Rabbah, also I took the city of waters.
And now gather together the rest of the people and encamp against the city, and take it, lest I shall take the city, and my name was called upon it.
And David will gather all the people together and go to Rabbah, and war against it and take it.
And he will take the crown of their king from his head; and its weight a talent of gold and a precious stone; and it will be upon David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city exceeding much.
And the people which were in it he brought forth, and he will put at the saw and at the threshing-sledge of iron, and at axes of iron, and caused them to pass over through the brick-kiln: and thus he will do to all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David will turn back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.
And it will be after this, and to Absalom son of David a fair sister, and her name Tamar; and Amnon, son of David, loved her.
And Amnon will be pressed to be sick for sake of Tamar his sister, for she was a virgin; and it will be hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.
And to Amnon a friend, and his name Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother: and Jonadab a man exceeding wise.
And he will say to him, Wherefore thou so weak, son of the king, in morning by morning? wilt thou not announce to me? and Amnon will say to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
And Jonadab will say to him, Lie upon thy bed and be sick, and thy father coming to see thee, and say to him, Now my sister Tamar shall come and give me to eat bread and make the food before mine eyes, so that I shall see and eat from her hand.
And Amnon will lie down and be sick: and the king will come to see him, and Amnon will say to the king, Will Tamar my sister come now, and she shall make before mine eyes two cakes, and I will eat from her hand.
And David will send to Tamar, saying, Go now to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make food for him.
And Tamar will go to the house of Amnon her brother, and he lay down. And she will take dough and knead, and make cakes before his eyes, and bake the cakes.
And she will take a frying-pan and pour out before him; and he will refuse to eat. And Amnon will say, Bring out every man from me. And they brought forth every man from him.
And Amnon will say to Tamar, Bring the cakes into the chamber, and I will eat from thine hand And Tamar will take the cakes which she made and bring to Amnon her brother into the chamber.
And she will bring near to him to eat, and he will lay hold upon her and say, Come lie with me, my sister.
And she will say to him, No, my brother, thou shalt not humble me; for so it shall not be done in Israel: thou shalt not do this folly.
And I, whither shall I cause my reproach to go? and thou wilt be as one of the foolish in Israel. And now, speak now, to the king, and he will not withhold me from thee.
And he would not hear to her voice; and he will be strong above her, and he will humble her and lie with her.
And Amnon will hate her with great hatred, greatly; for great the hatred which he hated her above the love which he loved her. And Amnon will say to her, Arise, go.
And she will say to him, No reasons: this evil great above the other which thou didst with me, to send me away. And he would not hear to her.
And he will call his boy serving him, and say, Send away now this from me without, and fasten the door after her.
And upon her a tunic reaching to the soles of the feet; for thus will the king's daughters, the virgins, be clothed with upper garments. And his attendant will bring her forth without, and he fastened the door after.
And Tamar will take ashes upon her head, and she rent the tunic reaching to the feet which was upon her, and she will put her hand upon her head and will go, going and crying.
And Absalom her brother will say to her Was Amnon thy brother with thee? and now my sister be silent, he is thy brother; thou shalt not set thy heart to this word. And Tamar will remain, and she was desolate in the house of Absalom her brother.
And king David heard all the words and it will kindle to him greatly.
And Absalom spake not with Amnon, from evil and even to good: for Absalom hated Amnon for the word that he humbled Tamar his sister.
And it will be for two years of days, and shearers will be to Absalom in Baal-Hazor, which is with Ephraim: and Absalom will call for all the king's sons.
And Absalom will come to the king and say, Behold now, shearers to thy servant: now will the king go, and his servants, with thy servant?
And the king will say to Absalom, No, my son, not now will we all go, and we will not be heavy upon thee. And he will press upon him, and he would not go, and he will bless him.
And Absalom will say, And shall not Amnon my brother now go with us? And the king will say to him, Wherefore shall he go with thee?
And Absalom will press upon him, and he will send with him Amnon and all the king's sons.
And Absalom will command his boys, saying, See now, when the heart of Amnon is good with wine, and I said to you, Strike Amnon; and kill him; ye shall not be afraid, for I commanded you: be strong and be for sons of strength.
And Absalom's boys will do to Amnon as Absalom commanded. And all the king's sons will rise up and ride each upon his mule and flee.
And it will be they in the way, and the report came to David saying, Absalom struck all the king's sons and not one remaining of them.
And the king will rise and rend his garments, and will lie down upon the earth; and all his servants standing by with their garments rent.
And Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David's brother, will answer and say, My lord shall not say, All the boys, the king's sons, were slain; for Amnon alone died; for by the mouth of Absalom it was set from the day he humbled Tamar his sister.
And now my lord the king shall not set to his heart the word, saying, All the king's sons died; for only Amnon alone died.
And Absalom will flee. And the boy watching will lift up his eyes and see, and behold, much people coming from the way behind him from the side of the mountain.
And Jonadab will say to the king, Behold, the king's sons came; as thy servant spake, so it was.
And it will be as he finished to speak, and behold, the king's sons came, and they will lift up their voice and weep: and the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.
And Absalom fled and went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And he will mourn for his son all the days.
And Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and he will be there three years.
And David the king was fixed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted for Amnon, for he died.
And Joab son of Zeruiah, knew that the king's heart was for Absalom.
And Joab will send to Tekoah and take from thence a wise woman, and he will say to her, Thou shalt mourn, and put on now garments of mourning, and thou shalt not be anointed with oil, and be thou as a woman this many days mourning for the dead:
And come to the king and speak to him according to this word. And Joab will put words in her mouth.
And the woman, the Tekoite, will speak to the king and fall upon her face to the earth, and worship him, and say, Save, O king!
And the king will say to her, What to thee? And she will say, Truly I a widow woman, and my husband will die.
And to thy servant two sons, and they two will strive in the field, and none delivering between them; and the one will smite the one and kill him.
And behold, all the family rose up against thy servant, and they will say, Give him striking his brother and we will kill him for the soul of his brother whom he slew; and they destroyed also the heir, and quenched my coal which was left, so that name was not set to my husband and remainder upon the face of the earth.
And the king will say to the woman, Go to thy house and I will command concerning thee.
And the woman, the Tekoite, will say to the king, Upon me, my lord the king, the iniquity, and upon my father's house: and the king and his throne innocent.
And the king will say, Who speaking to thee and bring him to me and he shall not add to touch upon thee.
And she will say, The king will remember now, Jehovah thy God, the nearest relation of blood being multiplied to destroy, and they shall not destroy my son. And he will say, Jehovah living, if there shall fall from the hair of thy son to the earth.
And the woman will say, Shall thy servant speak now a word to my lord the king? And the king will say, Speak.
And the woman will say, And wherefore didst thou reckon according to this concerning the people of God? for the king speaks this word as transgressing for the king not to turn back his fugitive.
For dying, we shall die, and as waters poured out on the earth, which will not be gathered; and God will not lift up the soul: and reckoning, he reckons that the fugitive shall not be driven out from him.
And now that I came to speak to the king my lord, this word, for the people will see me, and thy servant will say, I will speak now to the king, perhaps the king will do the word of his servant.
For the king will hear to deliver his servant from the band of the man destroying me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
And thy servant will say, Now will the word of my lord the king be for a sacrifice, for as a messenger of God, so my lord the king to hear the good and the evil: and Jehovah thy God will be with thee.
And the king will answer and say to the woman, Now thou shalt not hide from me the word which I ask thee. And the woman will say, Now will my lord the king speak?
And the king will say, The hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman will answer and say, Thy soul living, my lord the king, if there is to the right or to the left from all which my lord the king spake: for thy servant Joab he commanded me, and he put in the mouth of thy servant all these words.
For the sake of turning about the face of the word, thy servant Joab did this word: and my lord was wise according to the wisdom of a messenger of God, to know all which is upon the earth.
And the king will say to Joab, Behold now, I did this word: and go and turn back the boy Absalom.
And Joab will fall upon his face to the earth, and worship him, and bless the king: and Joab will say, This day thy servant knew that I found grace in thine eyes, my lord, O king, for that the king did the word of his servant.
And Joab will rise and go to Geshur and bring Absalom to Jerusalem.
And the king will say, He shall turn about to his house and not see my face. And Absalom will turn to his house and not see the face of the king.
And as Absalom there was not a fair man in all Israel to praise greatly: from the sole of his foot and even to his crown, there was not a blemish in him.
And in his shaving his head (and it was from the end of days to days that he will shave, for it was heavy upon him;) and he shaved and weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the stone of the king.
And there will be born to Absalom three sons and one daughter, and her name Tamar: she was a woman of fair aspect.
And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem two years of days, and saw not the king's face.
And Absalom will send to Joab to send him to the king, and he would not come to him: and he will send yet the second time, and he would not come.
And he will say to his servants, See, Joab's portion to my hand, and barley to him there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the portion on fire.
And Joab will rise and come to Absalom to the house, and say to him, Wherefore did thy servants set on fire the portion which is to me?
And Absalom will say to Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, and I will send thee to the king, saying, Wherefore came I from Geshur? Good to me even I was there: and now I will see the king's face; and if there is iniquity in me, and kill me.
And Joab will come to the king and announce to him: and he will call for Absalom, and he will come to the king and worship to him upon his face to the earth before the king: and the king will kiss Absalom.
And it will be from after this, and Absalom will make to him chariots and horses, and fifty men running before him.
And Absalom rose early and stood by the hand of the way of the gate: and it will be every man which shall be to him strife coming to the king for judgment, and Absalom will call to him and say, Where, from what city thou? And he will say, of one of the tribes of Israel is thy servant.
And Absalom will say to him, See, thy words good and straight, and none to hear to thee from the king.
And Absalom will say, Who will set me judge in the land? and to me shall every man come which shall be to him strife and judgment, and I did him justice.
And it was in a man's coming near to worship to him, and he stretched forth his hand and laid hold of him, and kissed him.
And Absalom will do according to this word to all Israel who will come for judgment to the king: and Absalom will steal the heart of the men of Israel.
And it will be from the end of forty years, and Absalom will say to the king, I will go now and complete my vow which I vowed to Jehovah in Hebron.
For thy servant vowed a vow in my dwelling in Geshur in Aram, saying, If turning back, Jehovah shall turn me back to Jerusalem, and I served Jehovah.
And the king will say to him, Go in peace. And he will rise and go to Hebron.
And Absalom will send spies in all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye heard the voice of the trumpet, and ye said, Absalom the king in Hebron.
And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, being called; going uprightly, and they knew not any word.
And Absalom will send for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, from Giloh, in his sacrificing sacrifices. And the conspiracy will be strong; and the people went and a multitude with Absalom.
And he announcing, will come to David, saying, The heart of the man Israel was after Absalom.
And David will say to all his servants which are with him in Jerusalem, Arise, and we will flee, for escape will not be to us from the face of Absalom: hasten to go lest he shall hasten to hedge us in, and thrust evil upon us, and smite the city with the mouth of the sword.
And the king's servants will say to the king, According to all which my lord the king shall choose, behold thy servants.
And the king will go forth, and all his house at his feet. And the king will leave ten women, concubines, to watch the house.
And the king will go forth, and all the people at his feet, and they will stand in a house far off.
And all his servants passing by upon his hand; and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came at his foot from Gath, passing by at the face of the king.
And the king will say to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore wilt thou go, also thou, with us? turn back and dwell with the king, for thou a stranger and thou an exile to thy place.
Yesterday thy coming, and this day shall I cause thee to wander about to go with us? and I go where I go, turn back, and turn back thy brethren with thee mercy and truth.
And Ittai will answer the king, and say, Jehovah lives, and my lord the king lives, for surely in the place where my lord the king shall be, there whether for death, whether for life, for there will thy servant be.
And David will say to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite will pass over, and all his men, and all the little ones that are with him.
And all the land weeping with a great voice, and all the people passing over: and the king passed over upon the torrent Kidron, and all the people passing over upon the face of the way to the desert.
And behold, also Zadok, and all the Levites with him, lifting up the ark of the covenant of God; and they placed the ark of God: and Abiathar will go up till all the people finished passing over from the city.
And the king will say to Zadok, Turn back the ark of God to the city: if I shall find grace in the eyes of Jehovah, and he turned me back, and caused me to see it and its rest.
And if he say thus, I delighted not in thee; behold me, he will do to me as is good in his eyes.
And the king will say to Zadok the priest, Thou seest: turn back to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.
See me lingering in Araboth of the desert till word come from you to announce to me.
And Zadok and Abiathar will turn back the ark of God to Jerusalem: and they will sit there.
And David went up in the ascent of the olive trees, going up and weeping, and the head to him covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people which were with him covered each his head, and they went up, going up and weeping.
And it was announced to David, saying, Ahithophel among those conspiring with Absalom. And David will say, Now make foolish the counsel of Ahithophel, O Jehovah.
And it will be David came even to the head where he will worship there to God, and behold, to his meeting, Hushai the Archite, his tunic rent and earth upon his head.
And David will say to him, If thou didst pass over with me thou wert for a burden to me.
And if to the city, thou shalt turn back and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; thy father's servant from then, and now thy servant: and thou didst frustrate for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
And is not with thee there Zadok and Abiathar the priests? and it being all the word which thou shalt hear from the king's house, thou shalt announce to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests.
Behold there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok, and Jonathan to Abiathar; and send by their hand to me every word which ye shall hear.
And Hushai, David's friend, will come to the city, and Absalom will come to Jerusalem.
And David passed over a little from the head, and behold, Ziba, Mephibosheth's boy, to his meeting, and a pair of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred of bread and a hundred bunches of dried grapes, and a hundred of fruits, and a flask of wine.
And the king will say to Ziba, What are these to thee? and Ziba will say, The asses for the house of the king to ride; and the bread and the fruits for the food of the boys, and the wine for the drinking of the faint in the desert.
And the king will say, And where the son of thy lord? And Ziba will say to the king: Behold, he will dwell in Jerusalem: for he said, This day the house of Israel will turn back to me the kingdom of my father.
And the king will say to Ziba, Behold, to thee all which was to Mephibosheth. And Ziba will say, I worshiped; shall I find grace in the eyes of my lord the king?
And king David went to Bahurim, and behold, from thence a man will come forth from the family of the house of Saul, and his name Shimei, son of Gera: he came forth, coming forth and cursing.
And he will stone David with stones, and all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty, from his right hand and from his left.
And thus said Shimei in his cursing, Come forth, come forth, thou man of bloods and man of.
Jehovah turned back upon thee Belial all the bloods of the house of Saul of whom thou didst reign in his stead; and Jehovah will give the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold thee in thine evil, for a man of bloods art thou.
And Abishai son of Zeruiah will say to the king, Wherefore shall this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will pass over now and take away his head.
And the king will say, What to me and you ye sons of Zeruiah? for he shall curse, and because Jehovah said to him, Curse David: and who shall say, Wherefore didst thou thus?
And David will say to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold my son who came forth from my bowels seeks my soul: and how much more now the son of the Jaminite? Leave to him and he shall curse, for Jehovah said to him.
Perhaps Jehovah will look upon my wrong, and Jehovah turn back to me good for his cursing this day.
And David went, and his men, in the way; and Shimei went by the side of the mountain near to him going, and he will curse and stone with stones near to him, and dusting with dust.
And the king will come, and all the people which are with him, weary, and he will be refreshed there.
And Absalom and all the people, the man Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
And it will be, as Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, and Hushai will say to Absalom, The king shall live, the king shall live.
And Absalom will say to Hushai, This thy mercy with thy friend? wherefore wentest thou not with thy friend?
And Hushai will say to Absalom, Nay; for whom Jehovah chose and this people, and every man of Israel, shall I not be and dwell with him?
And the second time, to whom shall I serve if not before the son? as I served before thy father so will I be before thee.
And Absalom will say to Ahithophel, Bring counsel to yourselves what we shall do.
And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, Come in to thy father's concubines which he left to watch the house; and all Israel hearing that thou madest thy father loathsome, and the hands of all that are with thee were strengthened.
And they will stretch out a tent for Absalom upon the roof, and Absalom will go in to his father's concubines before the eyes of all Israel.
And the counsel of Ahithophel which he counseled in those days, according as it will be asked in the word of God: thus all the counsel of Ahithophel also to David also to Absalom.
And Ahithophel will say to Absalom, I will now choose twelve thousand men, and I will rise and pursue after David this night:
And I shall come upon him and he being weary and relaxed in hands, and I made him afraid: and all the people which are with him, fleeing; and I struck the king alone,
And I will turn back all the people to thee: as the turning back of all, the man whom thou seekest; and to all the people shall be peace.
And the word will be straight in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all the old men of Israel.
And Absalom will say, Call now also for Hushai the Archite, and we will hear also, what is in his mouth.
And Hushai will come to Absalom, and Absalom will say to him, saying, According to this word spake Ahithophel: shall we do his word? if not, speak thou.
And Hushai will say to Absalom, The counsel which Ahithophel counseled is not good in this time.
And Hushai will say, Thou knewest thy father and his men that they are mighty, and they bitter of soul as a bear bereaved of offspring in the field: and thy father a man of war, and he will not lodge with the people.
Behold now, he hid in one of the pits, or in one of the places: and it being when there fell among them in the beginning, and he hearing heard and said, was a slaughter among the people which are after Absalom.
And he also the son of strength whose heart according to the heart of the lion, melting, will melt away: for all Israel knew that thy father is mighty, and the sons of strength which are with him.
For I counseled being gathered, all Israel shall be gathered to thee from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, as the sand which is upon the sea for multitude; and thy face going in the midst of them.
And we came upon him in one of the places which we shall find there, and we upon him as the dew will fall upon the earth: and we will not leave of him and of all the men which are with him, even one.
And if he shall be gathered into the city, and all Israel shall lift up ropes to that city, and we dragged it even to the torrent, till we shall not find there even a stone.
And Absalom will say, and every man of Israel, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is good above the counsel of Ahithophel. And Jehovah commanded to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel so that Jehovah brought evil upon Absalom.
And Hushai will say to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, According to this, and according to this, Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the old men of Israel; and according to this and according to this, I counseled.
And now send quickly and announce to David, saying, Thou wilt not lodge this night in Araboth of the desert, and also passing over, thou shalt pass over, lest he shall swallow up to the king and to all the people which are with him.
And Jonathan and Ahimaaz standing by the fountain of Rogel; and a maid-servant went and announced to them, and they will go, and announce to king David, for they will not be able to be seen to come to the city.
And a boy will see them and be will announce to Absalom; and they two will go quickly and will come to the house of a man in Bahurim, and to him a well In his enclosure; and they will go down there,
And the woman will take and spread the covering upon the mouth of the well and she will spread the medicine upon it; and the word will not be known.
And Absalom's servants will come to the woman to her house, and they will say, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? and the woman will say to them, They passed over the brook of waters. And they will seek and not find; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
And it will be after their going, and they will come up out of the well and will go and announce to king David, and they will say to David, Arise ye, and pass quickly over the waters, for thus counseled Ahithophel against you.
And David will rise, and all the people which are with him, and they will pass over Jordan: till the light of the morning till not one was lacking which passed not over Jordan.
And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he will saddle the ass and rise and go to his house to his city, and command his house, and he will strangle himself and die. And he will be buried in the grave of his father.
And David came to the camp. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
And Absalom set Amasa instead of Joab over the army: and Amasa a man's son, and his name Ithra, the Israelite, who went in to Abigail, daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab.
And Israel and Absalom will encamp in the land of Gilead.
And it will be as David went to Mahanaim, and Shobi, son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
Beds and basins and vessels of earth, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched grain, and the bean and lentiles, and parched grain,
And honey and curdled milk, and sheep, and cheeses of kine, they brought near for David and for the people which Are with him, to eat; for they said the people are hungry and faint and thirsty in the desert.
And David will review the people which are with him, and he will put over them captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds.
And David will send the people a third into the hand of Joab, and a third into the hand of Abishai, son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, and a third into the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king will say to the people, Going forth, I will go forth, also I, with you.
And the people will say, Thou shalt not go forth, for if fleeing, we shall flee, they will not set the heart to us; and if half of us shall die they will not set the heart to us: but now like us ten thousand: and now it is good that thou shalt be to us from the city for help.
And the king will say to them, What will be good in your eyes I will do. And the king will stand at the hand of the gate, and all the people will go forth, by hundreds and by thousands.
And the king will command Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Gently for me to the boy, to Absalom. And all the people heard in the king's commanding all the chiefs for the word of Absalom.
And the people will go forth to the field to the meeting of Israel: and the war will be in the forest of Ephraim;
And there the people of Israel will be struck before David's servants, and a great slaughter will be in that day of twenty thousand.
And there the battle will be scattered upon the face of all the earth: and the forest will multiply to consume of the people above what the sword will consume in that day.
And Absalom will meet before the servants of David, and Absalom rode upon the mule, and the mule will go under the thicket of the great oak, and his head will lay hold upon the oak, and he will be given between the heavens and between the earth; and the mule which was under him passed by.
And one man will see and announce to Joab, and say, Behold, I saw Absalom suspended in an oak.
And Joab will say to the man announcing to him, And behold, thou sawest, and wherefore didst thou not strike him there to the earth? and for me to give to thee ten of silver and one girdle.
And the man will say to Joab, And not I weighing upon my hand a thousand of silver, I will not stretch forth my hand against the king's son, for in our ears, the king commanded thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Watch for me over the boy, over Absalom.
Or I did falsehood upon his soul; and any word will not be hid from the king, and thou wilt stand opposite.
And Joab will say, I will not delay before thee. And he will take three spears in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, he yet living in the heart of the oak.
And ten boys lifting up Joab's arms will surround and strike Absalom, and kill him.
And Joab will strike upon the trumpet, and the people will turn back from pursuing after Israel: for Joab restrained the people.
And they will take Absalom and cast him in the forest into a great pit, and they will set upon him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled each to his tent.
And Absalom took and set up for him in his living, a pillar in the valley of the king; for he said, Not to me a son to call my name to mind: and he will call the pillar by his name, and he will call it The Hand of Absalom, even to this day.
And Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, said, I will run now and bring good news to the king that Jehovah judged him out of the hand of his enemies.
And Joab will say to him, Not thou a man of glad tidings this day, and another day thou shalt announce good news: and this day thou shalt not announce good news, because the king's son died.
And Joab will say to Cushi, Go, announce to the king what thou sawest. And Cushi will worship to Joab, and run.
And Ahimaaz, son of Zadok will yet add, and say to Joab, What will be, I will run now, also I, after Cushi. And Joab will say, Wherefore this runnest thou my son, and goest, not finding good tidings?
And what will be, I will run. And he will say to him, Run. And Ahimaaz will run the way of the circuit, and pass by Cushi.
And David will sit between the two gates: and he watching will go to the roof of the gate to the wall, and he lift up his eyes and see, and behold, a man running by himself.
And the watcher will call and announce to the king. And the king will say, If alone, good news in his month. And he will go, going, and draw near.
And he watching will see another man running, and the watcher will call at the gate and say, Behold, a man running alone. And the king will say, This also announces good tidings.
And the watcher will say, I saw the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz, Zadok's son. And the king will say, A good man this, and he will come for good news.
And Ahimaaz will call and say to the king, Peace. And he will worship to the king upon the face to the earth, and he will say, Blessed Jehovah thy God who shut up the men who lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
And the king will say, Peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Ahimaaz will say, I saw the great multitude at Joab's sending the King's servant, and thy servant; and I knew not what.
And the king will say, Turn, stand here. And he will turn and stand.
And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi will say, Good news will be announced, my lord the king, for Jehovah judged thee this day from the hand of all rising up against thee.
And the king will say to Cushi, Is peace to the boy, to Absalom? And Cushi will say, As the boy, shall all the enemies of my lord the king be, and all who rose up against thee for evil.
And the king will be moved, and he will go up into the upper chamber of the gate and weep: and thus he said in his going, My son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom I who will give my death, me for thee, Absalom my son, my son!
And it will be announced to Joab, Behold, the king weeping, and he will mourn for Absalom.
And the salvation in that day will be turned to mourning to all the people: for the people heard in that day, saying the king was grieved for his son.
And the people will steal away in that day to go to the city, as people will steal away being ashamed in fleeing in battle.
And the king covered his face, and the king will cry out with a great voice, My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!
And Joab will come to the king, to the house, and say, Thou shamedst this day the faces of all thy servants saving thy soul this day, and the soul of thy sons and thy daughters, and the soul of thy wives, and the soul of thy concubines;
To love those hating thee, and hating those loving thee, for thou announcedst this day that not to the chiefs and servants: for I knew this day that if Absalom lived and all we this day died, that then it was straight in thine eyes.
And now arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants: for in Jehovah I swore if thou wilt not go forth, if a man shall lodge with thee this night: and this evil to thee above all the evil which came upon thee from thy youth till now.
And the king will rise and sit in the gate. And to all the people they announced, saying, Behold, the king sitting in the gate. And all the people will come before the king: and Israel fled a man to his tent.
And all the people will be judging in all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us from the hand of the rovers and now he fled from the land from Absalom.
And Absalom whom we anointed over us died in war. And now, wherefore are ye silent to turn back the king?
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak ye to the old men of Judah, saying, Wherefore will ye be the last to turn back the king to his house? And the word of all Israel came to the king to his house.
Ye my brethren; my bone and flesh are ye: and wherefore will ye be last to turn back the king?
And to Amasa ye shall say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? thus will God do to me and thus will he add, if thou shalt not be chief of the army before me all the days, instead of Joab.
And he will incline the heart of all the men of Judah as one man; and they will send to the king, Turn back thou, and all thy servants.
And the king will turn back and come to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.
And Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, will hasten and come down with the man Judah to meet king David.
And a thousand men with him from Benjamin, and Ziba the boy of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
The passing over passed over to cause the house of the king to pass over, and to do the good in his eyes. And Shimei son of Gera, fell before the king in his passing over Jordan.
And he will say to the king, My lord will not reckon iniquity to me, and he will not remember what thy servant did perversely in the day which my lord the king came forth from Jerusalem, for the king to set to his heart.
For thy servant knew that I sinned: and behold, I came this day the first for all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.
And Abishai son of Zeruiah, will say, For this shall not Shimei be put to death? for he cursed Jehovah's Messiah.
And David will say, What to me, and to you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye shall be to me for an adversary? Shall there this day be a man put to death in Israel? Did I not know that this day I am king over Israel?
And the king will say to Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the king will swear to him.
And Mephibosheth son of Saul, came down to the meeting of the king, and he did not his feet, and he did not his beard, and his garments he washed not from the day the king went till the day in which he came in peace.
And it will be when he came to Jerusalem to the meeting of the king, and the king will say to him, Wherefore wentest thou not with me, Mephibosheth?
And he will say, My lord the king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle for me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and I will go to the king; for thy servant is lame.
And he will slander against thy servant to my lord the king; and my lord the king as a messenger of God: and do thou the good in thine eyes.
For was not all my father's house but men of death before my lord the king? and thou wilt set thy servant among those eating at thy table. And what is there to me yet of right and to cry yet to the king?
And the king will say to him, Wherefore wilt thou speak yet thy words? I said, Thou and Ziba shall divide the field.
And Mephibosheth will say to the king, Also he shall take all, after that my lord the king came in peace to his house.
And Barzillai the Gileadite will come down from Rogelim, and he will pass with the king over Jordan to send him upon Jordan.
And Barzillai a very old man, the son of eighty years: and he nourished the king in his dwelling in the two camps, for he was an exceeding great man.
And the king will say to Barzillai, Pass thou over with me, and I will nourish thee with me in Jerusalem.
And Barzillai will say to the king, According to what the days of the years of my life, that I shall go up with the king to Jerusalem?
The son of eighty years am I this day; shall I know between good to evil? if thy servant shall taste what I shall eat, and what I shall drink? if I shall yet hear to the voice of men singing or of women singing? and wherefore shall thy servant be yet for a burden to my lord the king?
As thy servant will pass a little over Jordan with the king; and wherefore shall the king recompense me this recompense?
Turn back now thy servant and I will die in my city, by the grave of my father and my mother: and behold, thy servant Chimham shall pass over with my lord the king; and do to him what is good in thine eyes.
And the king will say, With me shall Chimham pass over, and I will do to him the good in thine eyes; and all which thou shalt choose of me I will do to thee.
And all the people will pass over Jordan. And the king passed over, and the king will kiss to Barzillai, and bless him: and he will turn back to his place.
And the king will pass over to Gilgal, and Chimham passed over with him: and all the people of Judah will pass over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.
And behold, every man of Israel coming to the king, and they will say to the king, Wherefore did our brethren the men of Judah steal thee away, and they will cause the king to pass, and his house, over Jordan, and all David's men with him?
And every man of Judah will answer to the man Israel, Because the king being near to me: and wherefore does this kindle to thee on account of this word? did we eat food from the king? or lifting up, did he lift up to us?
And the man Israel will answer the man Judah, and say, Ten hands to me in the king, and also in David I above thee: and wherefore didst thou make light of me? and was not my word first to me to turn back my king? And the word of the man Judah will will be hard above the word of the man Israel.
And a man of Belial was met with there, and his name Sheba, son of Bichri, a man, a Jaminite: and he will strike upon the trumpet and say, No portion to us in David, and no inheritance to us in the son of Jesse: a man to his tent to Israel.
And every man of Israel will go up from after David, after Sheba, son of Bichri: and the men of Judah were joined to the king, from Jordan and even to Jerusalem.
And David will come to his house to Jerusalem; and the king will take the ten women, the concubines which he left to watch the house, and he will give them to the house of watch, and he will nourish them, and he went not in to them. And they will be bound together till the day of their death to live widows.
And the king will say to Amasa, Call together to me the men of Judah in three days, and stand thou here.
And Amasa will go to call Judah together: and he will delay from the appointment which he appointed him.
And David will say to Abishai, Now Sheba son of Bichri will do evil to us above Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants and go down after him, lest finding to himself fortified cities and he shadow our eyes.
And Joab's men went forth after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and all the mighty went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.
They by the great stone which is in the hill, and Amasa went before them. And Joab girded his garment being put upon him, and upon it he girded the sword being bound upon his loins in its sheath; and he going forth and it will fall.
And Joab will say to Amasa, Thou my brother in peace? and Joab's right hand will take hold of Amasa by the beard to kiss him.
And Amasa watched not upon the sword which was in Joab's hand: and he will strike him with it into the belly, and his bowels will be poured forth to the earth; and he repeated not to him; and he will die. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.
And a man from Joab's boys stood by him, and he will say, Who delighted in Joab, and who that is for David, after Joab.
And Amasa rolling in blood in the midst of the highway. And the man will see that all the people stood, and he will turn Amasa from the highway to the field, and he will cast upon him a garment when he saw all coming by him and standing.
When he was taken away from the highway every man passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.
And he will pass through in all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to the house of oppression, and all the Berites: and they will be called together, and they will go also after him.
And they will come and besiege against him in Abel of the house of oppression, and they will pour out a mound against the city, and it will stand in the fortification: and all the people which were with Joab laying waste to throw down the wall.
And a wise woman will call out of the city, Hear ye, hear ye; say now to Joab, Come near hither and I will speak to you.
And he will draw near to her, and the woman will say, Art thou Joab? and he will say, I. And she will say to him, Hear the words of thy servant And he will say, I hear.
And she will say, saying, They will speak the word in the beginning, saying, They will ask an asking in Abel: and thus they finished.
I peaceful of the faithful of Israel: thou seeking to kill a city and a mother in Israel: wherefore wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
And Joab will say, Far be it, far be it to me, if I shall swallow up and if I shall destroy.
Not thus the word; for a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri, his name, lifted up his hand against the king, against David: ye shall give him only, and I will go from the city. And the woman will say to Joab, Behold, his head being cast to thee behind the wall.
And the woman will go to all the people in her wisdom: and they will cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and cast to Joab. And he will strike upon the trumpet, and they will disperse from the city, a man to his tent. And Joab turned back to Jerusalem to the king.
And Joab over all the army of Israel: and Benaiah, son of Jehoida, over the Cherethites, and over the Pelethites.
And Adoniram over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, calling to mind:
And Sheva the scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
And also Ira the Jairite was priest to David.
And there will be a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David will seek the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah will say, For Saul and for the house of bloods, because he killed the Gibeonites.
And the king will call for the Gibeonites, and say to them; (and the Gibeonites not of the sons of Israel, but they from the remainder of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel sware to them: and Saul will seek to strike them in his jealousy for the sons of Israel and Judah.)
And David will say to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I expiate and bless ye the inheritance of Jehovah?
And the Gibeonites will say to him, Not to me silver and gold with Saul and with his house; and not for us to put a man to death in Israel. And he will say, What ye say, I will do for you.
And they will say to the king, The man who finished us, and who made an end of us, destroying us from standing in all the bound of Israel,
Seven men of his sons shall be given to us and we will hang them up before Jehovah in the hill of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah. And the king will say, I will give.
And the king will spare upon Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, son of Saul, on account of the oath of Jehovah which was between them, <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as:</i></font> betwen<Rf>between David and between Jonathan, son of Saul.
And the king will take the two sons of Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, which she bare to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Michal, Saul's daughter, which she bare to Adriel, son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
And he will give them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they will hang them in the mountain before Jehovah: and the seven will fall together, and they were put to death in the days of harvest in the first of the beginning of the harvest of barley.
And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah will take sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest till water was given upon them from the heavens, and she gave not the birds of the heavens to rest upon them in the day and the beast of the field at night.
And it will be announced to David what Rizpah the <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as: </i></font><b> daugher</b><Rf>daugther of Aiah, concubine of Saul did.
And David will go and take the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the lords of Jabesh-Gilead, who stole them from the street of the House of Shan, where the rovers hung them there in the day the rovers struck Saul in Gilboa:
And he will bring up from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they will gather the bones of those being hung.
And they will bury the bones of Saul, and Jonathan his son, in the land of Benjamin in Zelzah in the grave of Kish his father: and they will do all which the king commanded. And God will hear for the land after this.
And yet there will be war to the rovers with Israel; and David will go down, and his servants with him, and they will fight with the rovers: and David will be faint.
And Ishbi-Benob who was from the children of Rephaim, and the weight of his spear three hundred weight of brass, and he being girded with a new one, and he will say to strike David.
And Abishai son of Zeruiah will help for him, and he will strike the rover and kill him. Then David's men sware to him, saying, Thou shalt no more go forth with us to war, and thou shalt not quench the light of Israel.
And it will be after this, and there will be war yet in Gob with the rovers: then Sibbechai the Hushathite struck Saph who was of the children of Rephaim.
And there will be yet war in Gob with the rovers, and Elhanan, son of Jaare-Oregim of the House of Bread, will strike Goliah the Gathite, and the wood of his spear as the beam of those weaving.
And there will be yet war in Gath, and there will be a man of Midian, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet, six and six; twenty and four of number: and also he child to Rephah.
And he will reproach Israel, and Jonathan, son of Shimeab, David's brother, will strike him.
Those four were born to Rephah in Oath, and they will fall by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
And David will speak to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:
And he will say, Jehovah my rock and my fastness and my deliverer;
The God of my rock; I will trust in him: My shield and the horn of my salvation, my height and my refuge; My saviour; thou wilt save me from violence.
Praising, I will call Jehovah and shall be saved from mine enemies.
For the breakers of death surrounded me The torrents of Beilal will terrify me;
The pangs of hades surrounded me; The snares of death anticipated me;
In straits to me I will call Jehovah, And to God will I call, And he will hear my voice from his temple, And my cry in his ears.
And the earth will shake and tremble, The foundation of the heavens will be disturbed, And they will shake, for it kindled to him.
Smoke went up in his anger, And fire from his mouth shall consume: Coals were kindled from it.
He will incline the heavens and come down; And darkness under his feet.
And he will ride upon a cherub and fly: And he will be seen upon the wings of the wind.
And he will set darkness round about him for booths, The gatherings of waters the darkness of clouds.
From the shining before him were coals of fire kindled:
Jehovah will thunder from the heavens, And the Most High will give his voice.
He will send arrows and scatter them lightning, and put them in commotion.
The torrents of the sea will be seen, The foundations of the habitable globe will be uncovered, In the rebuke of Jehovah, from the breath of the spirit of his anger.
He will send from height, he will take me; He will draw me out of many waters:
He will deliver me from my strong enemy, From them hating me, for they were strong above me.
They will anticipate me in the day of misfortune, And Jehovah will be a support to me:
And he will bring me forth to a wide place; He will deliver me for he delighted in me.
Jehovah will recompense me according to my justice: According to the cleanness of my hands he turned back to me.
For I have watched the ways of Jehovah, And I acted not wickedly away from my God.
For all his judgments before me, And his laws I will not depart from them.
And I will be blameless to him, and I shall be washed from mine iniquity.
Jehovah will turn back to me according to my justice: According to my cleanness before his eyes.
With the merciful thou wilt be merciful, With the perfect man thou wilt be perfect.
With the chosen thou wilt be chosen, And with the perverse thou wilt be unseasoned.
And the people of affliction thou wilt save: And thine eyes upon the lifted up, thou wilt humble.
For thou my light, O Jehovah: And Jehovah will enlighten my darkness.
For in thee will I run, being pressed In my God will I leap over a wall.
The Strong One, blameless his way The saying of Jehovah purified, A shield to all trusting in him.
For who God besides Jehovah? And who a rock besides our God?
The Strong One strengthening me with strength: And he will leave his way blameless.
Setting my feet as the hinds: And upon the heights will he cause me to stand.
Teaching my hands to the war, And bringing down the brazen bow by mine arm.
And thou wilt give to me the shield of thy salvation, and thine answer will multiply me.
Thou wilt enlarge my steps under me, And my joints were not unsteady.
I will pursue mine enemies and destroy them I will not turn back even to finishing them.
And I will consume them and crush them, and they shall not be raised up.
Thou wilt fasten me together with strength for the war, Thou wilt subdue under me him rising up against me.
And the neck of mine enemies wilt thou give to me Those hating me, and I will cut them off.
They will look, and no saviour To Jehovah, and he answered them not.
And I will rub them as the dust of the earth: As the mire of the streets I will stamp them, I will beat them:
And thou wilt save me from the strifes of my people, Thou wilt watch me for the head of nations: The people I have not known shall serve me.
The sons of the stranger will lie to me: For the hearing of the ear they will hear to me.
The sons of the stranger shall fail, and be girded from their enclosings.
Jehovah living; and praised my rock: And God shall be lifted up, the rock of my salvation.
The Strong One giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me.
And bringing me out from mine enemies lifting me up from them rising up against me: From the man of violence thou wilt deliver me.
For this will I praise thee, O Jehovah, in the nations, to thy name will I play on the harp.
Magnifying the salvation of his king: And he has done mercy to his Messiah To David and to his seed even to forever.
And these the last words of David. The declaration of David, son of Jesse, and the declaration of the man raised up for the Messiah of the God of Jacob, and the sweet songs of Israel.
The Spirit of Jehovah spake in me, and his word upon my tongue.
The God of Israel said to me, the Rock of Israel spake a parable upon the just man: a parable to fear God.
And as the light of the morning the sun will rise: the morning not dense; from the shining of the rain bringing forth herbage from the earth.
For not thus my house with the Strong One, for he set to me an eternal covenant, prepared in all, and watched: for all my salvation and delight will he not bring forth.
And Belial as the thorn thrusting out are all they, for they will not be taken by the hand.
And the man laboring in them shall be filled with iron and the wood of a spear; and in fire burning they shall burn in the dwelling.
These the names of the mighty, which were to David: the Tachmonite dwelling in the dwelling, head of the third; he Adino the Eznite: against eight hundred wounded at one time.
And after him Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi, among the three mighty with David in their upbraiding the rovers; they were gathered together there to war, and the men of Israel will go up.
He arose, and he will strike against the rovers till that his hand will be weary, and his hand will cleave to the sword: and Jehovah will do a great salvation in that day; and they sat down behind him only to strip off.
And after him, Shammah, son of Aga the Hararite. And the rovers will be gathered together to live; and there will be there a portion of the field full of lentiles: and the people fled from the face of the rovers.
And he will stand in the midst of the portion, and he will take it away, and he will strike the rovers: and Jehovah will do a great salvation.
And three of the thirty heads will go down and come to the harvest, to David, to the cave of Adullam: and the wild beasts, the rovers, encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
And David then in the fortress, and the station of the rovers then in the House of Bread.
And David will desire and say, Who will give me to drink waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate?
And the three mighty will break forth through the camp of the rovers, and draw waters from the well of the House of Bread, which is in the gate, and they will lift up and bring to David: and he would not drink them, and he will pour them out to Jehovah.
And he will say, Far be it to me, O Jehovah, my doing this the blood of the men going with their souls: and he would not drink them. These did the three mighty.
And Abishai Joab's brother, son of Zeruiah, he the head of the three. And he raised up his spear against three hundred wounded, and to him a name among the three.
Above the three was he not honored? and he will be to them for chief: and he came not even to the three.
And Benaiah son of Jehoida, son of a living man great of works, from Kabzeel, he struck two lions of god of Moab: and he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a well in the day of snow.
And he struck a man, an Egyptian, who was seeing; and in the hand of the Egyptian a spear; and he went down to him with a rod, and he will pluck the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and kill him with his spear.
These did Benaiah son of Jehoida, and to him a name among the three mighty.
He was honored above the thirty, and to the three he came not. And David will set him to his audience.
Asahel, brother of Joab, among the thirty; Elhanan, son of Dodo of the House of Bread.
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Helez the Paltite, Ira, son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, lifting up the arms of Joab, son of Zeruiah,
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
Uriah the Hittite: all, thirty and seven.
And the anger of Jehovah will add to kindle against Israel, and he stimulated David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Judah.
And the king will say to Joab, chief of the army which was with him, Go now, up and down through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, and review ye the people, and I shall know the number of the people.
And Joab will say to the king, Jehovah thy God will add to the people as they and as they a hundred times, and the eyes of my lord the king seeing: and my lord the king, wherefore delights he in this word?
And the king's word will be strong to Joab and to the chiefs of his army. And Joab went forth and the chiefs of his army before the king to review the people Israel.
And they will pass over Jordan, and they will encamp in Aroer, the right hand of the city which is in the midst of the torrent of Gad, and towards Jazer:
And they will come to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-Hodshi; and they will come to Dan-Jaan, and round about to Zidon.
And they will come to the fortress of Tyre, and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites; and they will go forth to the south of Judah to the Well of the Oath.
And they will turn aside through all the land, and they will come from the end of nine months and twenty days to Jerusalem.
And Joab will give the number of the reviewing of the people to the king: and there will be of Israel eight hundred thousand men of strength drawing sword; and the men of Judah, five hundred thousand men.
And the heart of David will strike him after he thus reviewed the people. And David will say to Jehovah, I sinned greatly in what I did: and now, O Jehovah, now pass by the iniquity of thy servant, for I was very foolish.
And David will rise in the morning, and the word of Jehovah was to Gad the prophet, seer of David, saying,
Go and speak to David, Thus said Jehovah, Three I lay upon thee: choose to thee one from them, and I will do to thee.
And Gad will come to David and announce to him, and say to him, Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land? and if three mouths to flee before thine adversaries, they pursuing thee? and if death to be three days in thy land? now know, and see what word I shall turn back to him sending me.
And David will say to Gad, Straits to me exceedingly: now we will fall into the hand of Jehovah, for many his compassions; and into the hand of man I will not fall.
And Jehovah will give death in Israel from the morning and even to the time of the appointment; and from the people will die from Dan and even to the Well of the Oath, seventy thousand men.
And the messenger will stretch forth his hand to destroy Jerusalem, and Jehovah will lament for the evil, and he will say to the messenger destroying among the people, Much now: let go thy hand. And the messenger of Jehovah was near the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David will say to Jehovah, in his seeing the messenger smiting the people, and he will say, Behold, I sinned and acted perversely; and these sheep, what did they? Now shall thy hand be upon me and upon my father's house.
And Gad will come to David in that day and say to him, Go up, raise up an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David will go up, according to the word of Gad, as Jehovah commanded.
And Araunah will look forth and see the king and his servants passing over to him: and Araunah will go forth and worship to the king, his face to the earth.
And Araunah will say, Wherefore came my lord the king to his servant? and David will say, To buy from thee the threshing-floor to build an altar to Jehovah, and the slaughter shall be withheld from above the people.
And Araunah will say to David, My lord the king shall take and bring up the good in his eyes: see, the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-rollers, and the instruments of the oxen for wood.
And Araunah gave all to the king for the king. And Araunah will say to the king, Jehovah thy God will take pleasure in thee.
And the king will say to Araunah, Nay, but buying, I will buy of thee at a price; and I will not bring up to Jehovah my God a burnt-offering gratuitously. And David will buy the threshing-floor and the oxen for the silver of fifty shekels.
And David will build there an altar to Jehovah, and he will bring up burnt-offerings and peace. And Jehovah will be entreated for the land, and the slaughter will be withheld from Israel.
And king David was old, going in days; and they will cover him with garments, and he will not be warm.
And his servants will say to him, They shall seek for my lord the king a girl, a virgin, and she standing before the king, and she shall be to him an associate, and lying in thy bosom, and it shall be warm to my lord the king.
And they will seek a fair girl in all the bound of Israel, and they will find Abishag the Shunamite, and they will bring her to the king.
And the girl fair, even exceedingly, and she will be to the king an associate, and she will serve him: and the king knew her not.
And Adonijah, son of Haggith being lifted up, saying, I will reign; and he will make to himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
And his father grieved him not from his days, saying, Wherefore didst thou thus? and he good of form, exceedingly; and she bare him after Absalom.
And his words will be with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they will help after Adonijah.
And Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, son of Jehoida, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty which were to David, were not with Adonijah.
And Adonijah will sacrifice sheep and oxen and the fatling, by the stone of Zoheleth, which is next the fountain of the fuller, and he will call all his brethren the king's sons, and for all the men of Judah the king's servants:
And Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
And Nathan will say to Bathsheba, saying, Didst thou not hear that Adonijah son of Haggith reigned, and David our lord knew not?
Come now, advising, I will now advise thee, and save thou thy soul and the soul of thy son Solomon.
Come, go in to king David, and say to him, My lord the king, didst thou not swear to thy servant, saying, That Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? and wherefore did Adonijah reign?
Behold thee yet speaking with the king, and I will come in after thee and complete thy words.
And Bath-sheba will go in to the king to the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite serving the king.
And Bath-sheba will bow and worship to the king, and the king will say, What to thee?
And she will say to him, My lord, thou didst swear by Jehovah thy God to thy servant that Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
And now, behold, Adonijah reigning; and now my lord the king knew not:
And he will sacrifice oxen and the fatling, and sheep for multitude, and he will call to all the sons of the king, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab, chief of the army: and Solomon thy servant he called not.
And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee to announce to them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.
And being when my lord the king lies down with his fathers, I and my son Solomon being the sinful.
And behold her yet speaking with the king, and Nathan the prophet came in.
And they will announce to the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And he will come in before the king, and he will worship to the king upon his face to the earth.
And Nathan will say, My lord the king, saidst thou Adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne?
For he went down this day, and he will sacrifice oxen and the fatling, and sheep for multitude, and he will call to all the king's sons, and for the chief of the army, and for Abiathar the priest, and behold them eating and drinking before him, and they will say, King Adonijah shall live.
And for me, me thy servant, and for Zadok the priest, and for Benaiah son of Jehoida, and for Solomon thy servant, he called not.
If from my lord the king was this word, and thou madest not known to thy servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?
And king David will answer and say, Call to me for Bath-sheba. And she will come in before the king and stand before the king.
And the king will swear, and say, Jehovah lives who redeemed my soul from all straits.
For us I swear to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying that Solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne instead of me; for so I will do this day.
And Bath-sheba will bow the face to the earth and worship to the king, and say, My lord king David shall live forever,

And the king will say to them, Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon the mule which is to me, and bring down to Gihon:
And Zadok the priest anointed him there, and Nathan the prophet, for king over Israel: and strike ye upon the trumpet and say, King Solomon shall live.
And come up after him, and he coming, and he shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign instead of me: and I commanded him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
And Benaiah, son of Jehoida, will answer the king and say, Verily: so will Jehovah say, the God of my lord the king.
As Jehovah was with my lord the king, so will he be with Solomon, and he will magnify his throne above the throne of my lord, king David.

So that Jehovah shall raise up his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy sons shall watch their way to go before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.
And also thou knewest what Joab on of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two chiefs of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether; and he will kill them and put the bloods of war in peace, and give the bloods of war upon his girdle which was upon his loins, and in his shoe upon his feet.
And do according to thy wisdom, and thou wilt not bring down his gray hairs in peace to hades.
And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou shalt do mercy, and they shall be of those eating at thy table: for so they came near to me in my fleeing from the face of Absalom thy brother.

And she will say, One small asking I ask from thee; thou wilt not turn away my face. And the king will say to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not turn away thy face.
And she will say, Give Abishag the Shunamite to Adonijah thy brother for wife.
And king Solomon will answer, and say to his mother, And wherefore didst thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? And ask for him the kingdom, for he my brother, the great above me; and for him Abiathar the priest, and Joab son of Zeruiah.
And king Solomon will swear by Jehovah, saying, Thus will God do to me, and thus will he add, for Adonijah spoke this word against his soul.

And it will be announced to king Solomon that Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, by the altar. And Solomon will send Benaiah son of Jehoida, saying, Go strike upon him.
And Benaiah will go to the tent of Jehovah, and say to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he will say, Nay; for here will I die. And Benaiah will turn back the king word, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
And the king will say to him, Do as he said, and strike upon him, and bury him; and take away the bloods which Joab shed gratuitously, from me and from my father's house.
And Jehovah turned back his blood upon his head, who struck upon two just men and good above him, and he will kill them with the sword, and my father David knew not, Abner son of Ner, chief of the army of Israel, and Amasa, son of Jether, chief of the army of Judah.

And Shimei will say, Good the word: according to what my lord the king spake, thus will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
And it will be from the end of three years, and two servants to Shimei, will flee to Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath: and they will announce to Shimci, saying, Behold, thy servants in Gath.
And Shimei will rise and saddle his ass, and go to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei will go and bring his servants from Gath.
And it will be announced to Solomon that Shimei went from Jerusalem to Gath, and he will turn back.
And the king will send and call for Shimei, and say to him, Did not I cause thee to swear by Jehovah, and attest to thee, saying, In the day of thy going forth, and thou wentest whither and whither, knowing, thou shalt know that dying, thou shalt die? and thou wilt say to me, Good the word I heard.
And wherefore didst thou not watch the oath of Jehovah, and the command which I commanded upon thee?

And Solomon will say, Thou didst with thy servant David, my father, great mercy, according as he went before thee in the truth and in justice and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou wilt watch for him this great mercy, and thou wilt give to him a son sitting upon his throne as this day.
And now, Jehovah my God, thou madest thy servant king instead of David my father and I a little boy, shall not know to go out and come in.
And thy servant in the midst of thy people which thou didst choose, many people which shall not be numbered and counted for multitude.
And give to thy servant a heart to hear to judge thy people to discern between good to evil: for who shall be able to judge this thy weighty people?
And the word will be good in the eyes of God that Solomon asked this word.
And God will say to him, Because thou didst ask this word, and didst not ask for thyself many days; and didst not ask for thyself riches, and didst not ask the soul of thine enemies: and didst ask for thyself to have understanding to hear judgment;
Behold, I did according to thy word, I gave to thee a wise and understanding heart; that there was not as thou before thee, and after thee there shall not arise like thee.
And also that thou askedst not I gave to thee, also riches, also honor, that there was not a man like thee among kings all thy days.

And she will rise in the middle of the night and take my son from beside me, and thy servant sleeping; and she will lay him in her bosom and her dead son she laid in my bosom.
And I shall rise in the morning to suckle my son, and behold, he was dead: and I shall attend to him in the morning, and behold, it was not my son that I brought forth.
And the other woman will say, Nay; for my son the living, and thy son the dead. And this said, No; for thy son the dead, and my son the living. And they spake before the king.
And the king will say, This says, My son the living, and thy son the dead; and this says, Nay; for thy son the dead, and my son the living.

And he will make ten wash-basins of brass: the one wash-basin will hold forty baths, four by the cubit the one wash-basin, the one wash-basin upon the one base to the ten bases.
And he will give five bases upon the shoulder of the house from the right, and five upon the shoulder of the house from its left: and he gave the sea from the shoulder of the house to the right to the east over against the south.
And Hiram will make the washbasins and the shovels and the vases: and Hiram will finish doing all the work which he made for king Solomon in the house of Jehovah.
The two pillars and the globes of the crowns which were upon the head of the two pillars and the two nets to cover the two globes of the crowns which were upon the head of the pillars;
And four hundred pomegranates to the two nets, two rows of pomegranates to the one net, to cover the two globes of the crowns which were upon the face of the pillars;
And the ten bases and the ten wash-basins upon the bases;
And the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;
And the pots and the shovels and the vases: and all these vessels which Hiram made for king Solomon of the house of Jehovah, of polished brass.
In the circuit of Jordan the king cast them, in the density of the earth between Succoth and between Zarthan.
And Solomon will leave all the vessels, an exceeding great multitude: and the weight of the brass was not searched out.
And Solomon will make all the vessels which are for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table which was upon it the bread of the face, of gold.
And the chandeliers, five from the right, and five from the left, before the oracle, of gold shut up; and the flower, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold.
And the thresholds, and the snuffers, and the vases, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of gold shut up; and the openings to the doors of the house within to the holy of holies, to the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.
And all the work will be completed which king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon will bring in the holy things of David his father: the silver and the gold and the vessels he gave into the treasures of the house of Jehovah.
Then Solomon will convoke together the old men of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, chiefs of the fathers to the sons of Israel, to king Solomon at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David: this is Zion.
And every man of Israel will be convoked to king Solomon in the month Ethanim in the festival: this the seventh month.
And all the old men of Israel will come, and the priests will lift up the ark.
And they will bring up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of appointment, and all the holy vessels which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites will bring them up.
And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel assembled together to him, with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen which shall not be counted and shall not be numbered for multitude.
And the priests will bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place to the oracle of the house to the holy of holies, to beneath the wings of the cherubims.
For the cherubims spreading out their wings to the place of the ark, and the cherubims will cover over the ark and over the parts from above.
And they will prolong the bars and the heads of the bars will be seen from the holies upon the face of the oracle, and they will not be seen without; and they will be there till this day.
Nothing in the ark only the two tables of stones that Moses set down there in Horeb which Jehovah cut out with the sons of Israel in their coming out of the land of Egypt.
And it will be in the priests coming out of the holy place, and the cloud filled the house of Jehovah.
And the priests will not be able to stand to serve from the face of the cloud for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
Then said Solomon, Jehovah spake to dwell in thick clouds.
Building, I built a house for thee to dwell, a place for thy resting forever.
And thy king will turn his face round and bless all the convocation of Israel; and all the convocation of Israel stood;
And he will say, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel, who spake by his mouth to David my father, and by his hand filled up, saying,
From the day which I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt I chose not a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I will choose upon David to be over my people Israel.
And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house for name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house for my name, it was good it was with thy heart.
But thou shalt not build a house, but thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
And Jehovah will raise up his word which he spake; and I shall rise instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake; and I will build the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
And I will set there a place for the ark, where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with our fathers in his bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
And Solomon will stand at the face of the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens:
And he will say, Jehovah the God of Israel, none like thee, the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth from beneath, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:
Which thou didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him: and thou wilt speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand thou didst complete as this day.
And now Jehovah God of Israel watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from my face sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go before me as thou didst go before me.
And now, O God of Israel, thy word now shall be firm which thou spakest to thy servant David my father.
For truly shall God dwell upon the earth? Behold the heavens and the heavens of the heavens shall not contain thee; much less this house which I built.
And look to the supplication of thy servant, and to his prayer, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the supplication which thy servant prays before thee this day:
For thine eye to be opened to this house night and day, to the place of which thou saidst, My name shall be there; to hear to the supplication which thy servant shall pray to this place.
And wilt thou hear to the prayer of thy servant and of thy people Israel which they shall pray to this place? and wilt thou hear to the place of thy dwelling to the heavens? and hear and forgive?
Whatever man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath lifted up upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house,
And thou wilt hear in the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants to condemn the unjust, to give his way upon his head, and to acquit the just, to give to him according to his justice.
In thy people Israel being struck before the enemy because they will sin against thee, and they turned back to thee, and they confessed thy name and prayed, and made supplication to thee in this house.
And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to their fathers?
In the heavens being shut up and there will be no rain when they shall sin against thee; and they pray to this place and profess thy name, and they turn back from their sin when thou shalt humble them:
And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel? for thou wilt teach them the good way which they shall go in it, and give rain upon thy land which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.
If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting, yellowness, the locust devouring; if his enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates, every blow, every sickness;
Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man to all thy people Israel which shall know a man the blow to his heart and spread forth his hands to this house:
Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and forgive and do, and give to a man according to all his ways? for thou wilt know his heart; for thou wilt know alone the heart of all the sons of men:
So that they will fear thee all the days which they live upon the face of the earth which thou gavest to our fathers.
And also for the strangers which are not of thy people Israel, he shall come from a land afar off for sake of thy name;
(For they will hear of thy great name and thy strong hand, and thy stretched out arm;) and coming and praying to this house;
Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call upon thee? so that all the people of the earth shall know thy name to fear thee as thy people Israel; and to know that thy name was called upon this house which I built.
If thy people shall go forth to war against his enemy in the way which thou shalt send them, and pray to Jehovah the way of the city which thou didst choose in it, and the house which I built for thy name:
And hear thou in the heavens their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment.
For they will sin against thee (for no man which will not sin) and thou wert angry with them and gave them before the enemy, and they carried them away their captives to the land of the enemy, far off or near;
And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried captive there, and they turned back and supplicated to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned and acted perversely, and did evil;
And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and prayed to thee the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name:
And hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment,
And forgive to thy people who sinned against thee, and all their transgressions which they transgressed against thee, and give them for compassion before those carrying them captive, and they compassionated them:
For they thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron:
For thine eyes to be opened to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy people Israel, to hear to them in all their calling to thee.
For thou didst separate them to thyself for an inheritance from all the people of the earth as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, in thy bringing our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.
And it will be as Solomon finished praying to Jehovah all this supplication and prayer, he rose from the face of the altar of Jehovah, from bending upon his knees and his hands spread forth to the heavens.
And he will stand and bless all the convocation of Israel with a great voice, saying,
Blessed Jehovah who gave rest to his people Israel, according to all which he spake: there fell not one word from all his good word which he spake by the hand of Moses his servant.
Jehovah our God will be with us as he was with our fathers: he will not forsake us, and he will not cast us off.
To incline our heart to him, to go in all his ways, and to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments which he commanded our fathers.
And these words which I supplicated before Jehovah shall be drawing near to Jehovah our God day and night, to do the judgment of his servant and the judgment of his people Israel, the word of a day in its day.
For all the people of the earth to know that Jehovah he is God, none besides.
And your hearts be perfect with Jehovah our God to go in his laws, and to watch his commands as this day.
And the king and all Israel with him sacrificed a sacrifice before Jehovah.
And Solomon will sacrifice a sacrifice of peace which he sacrificed to Jehovah, twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. And the king and all the sons of Israel will consecrate the house of Jehovah.
In that day the king consecrated the middle of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah: for he did there the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace: for the altar of brass which was before Jehovah was little for containing the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace.
And Solomon will make the festival in that day, and all Israel with him, a great convocation from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God seven days and seven days, fourteen days.
In the eighth day he sent away the people, and they will bless the king and go to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for all the good which Jehovah did for David his servant and for Israel his people.
And it will be when Solomon finished building the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and all the pleasure of Solomon which he desired to do,
And Jehovah will be seen to Solomon the second time as he was seen to him in the hill.
And Jehovah will say to him, I heard thy supplication and thy prayer which thou didst supplicate before me: I consecrated this house which thou didst build to put my name there even to forever; and mine eyes and my heart were there all the days.
And thou, if thou shalt go before me as David thy father went with integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that I commanded thee, my law and my judgment thou shalt watch:
And I raised up the throne of thy kingdom over Israel forever, as spake to David thy father, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.
If turning back, ye shall turn back, ye and your sons from after me, and shall not watch my commands, my laws which I gave before you, and ye went and served other gods and worshiped to them:
And I cut off Israel from the face of the earth which I gave to them and the house which I consecrated to my name I will cast out from my face; and Israel was for a parable and for a derision among all peoples.
And this house shall be high, every one passing by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss: and they said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land and to this house?
And they said, Because they forsook Jehovah their God who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and they will lay hold upon other gods and worship to them, and serve them: for this, Jehovah brought, upon them all this evil.
And it will be from the end of twenty years, when Solomon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the house of the king,
(Hiram, king of Tyre, aided Solomon in woods of cedars and in woods of cypresses, and in gold to all his desire) then king Solomon will give Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon gave to him, and they were not right in his eyes.
And he will say, What these cities which thou gavest to me, my brother? And he will call them the land Cabul even to this day.
And Hiram will send to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold.
And this the word of tribute which king Solomon brought up to build the house of Jehovah, and his house, and the fortress, and the walls of Jerusalem, and the enclosure, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
Pharaoh king of Egypt came up, and he will take Gezer and burn it in fire, and he killed the Canaanite dwelling in the city, and he will give it a sending to his daughter, Solomon's.
And Solomon will build Gezer, and the house of the hollow below,
And Baalath and Tadmor in the desert, in the land.
And all the cities of stores which were to Solomon, and the cities of chariots, and the cities of horsemen, and the pleasure of Solomon which he pleased to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon; and in all the land of his ruling.
All the people remaining of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, which were not of the sons of Israel;
Their sons which were left after them in the land, which the sons of Israel will not be able to destroy them, and Solomon will bring them up for tribute of work even to this day.
And of the sons of Israel, Solomon gave not to serve, for they were men of war, and his servants and his chiefs, and his warriors, and chiefs of chariots, and his horsemen.
These the chiefs being stationed which were over the work to Solomon, fifty and five hundred going down among the people working in the work.
But Pharaoh's daughter went up from the city of David to her house which he built for her: then he built the fortress.
And Solomon brought up three times in a year burnt-offerings and peace upon the altar which he built to Jehovah, and he burnt incense upon it that was before Jehovah: and he completed the house.
And Solomon made a ship in Ezion-Geber, which is with Eloth, upon the lip of the sea of sedge in the land of Edom.
And Hiram will send in the ships his servants, men of ships, knowing the sea with Solomon's servants.
And they will come to Ophir, and take gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and bring to king Solomon.
And queen Sheba heard the report of Solomon for the name of Jehovah, and she will come to try him in enigmas.
And she will come to Jerusalem with very weighty strength, camels lifting up spices, and exceeding much gold and precious stone: and she will come to Solomon and will speak to him all which was in her heart.
And Solomon will announce to her all her words: there was not a word hid from the king which he announced not to her.
And queen Sheba will see all Solomon's wisdom, and the house which he built,
And the food of his table, and the seats of his servants, and the standing of his attendants, and their vestments, and his cup-bearers, and his burnt-offerings which he will bring up to the house of Jehovah; and no more spirit was in her.
And she will say to the king, The word was truth which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom.
And I believed not the words until I came, and mine eyes will see it: and behold, the half was not announced to me: thou didst add wisdom and good to the report which I heard.
Happy thy men, happy these thy servants, standing before thee continually, hearing thy wisdom.
Jehovah thy God will be blessed, who delighted in thee to give thee upon the throne of Israel: in Jehovah's loving Israel forever, and he will set thee up for king to do judgment and justice.
And she will give to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices very many, and precious stone; there came no more as this spice for multitude which queen Sheba gave to king Solomon.
And also the ship of Hiram which lifted up gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir woods of almugs very many, and precious stone.
And the king will make of the almug trees a support for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, harps and lyres for songs; there came not such woods of almugs, and were not seen even to this day.
And king Solomon gave to queen Sheba all her desire which she asked, besides what he gave to her according to the hand of king Solomon. And she will turn and go to her land, she and her servants.
And the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year will be six hundred sixty and six talents of gold,
Besides from the men traveling about and from the traffic of the merchants, and all the kings of Arabia and all the prefects of the earth.
And king Solomon will make two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred of gold will come up upon the one shield.
And three hundred shields of beaten gold; three parts of gold will come up upon the one shield: and the king will give them to the house of the forest of Lebanon.
And the king will make a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold.
Six steps to the throne, and the head rounded to the throne from its back parts: and hands hence and thence upon the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the hands.
And twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, hence and thence: there was not made thus to all the kingdoms.
And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon, gold, and every vessel of the house of the forest of Lebanon, gold shut up; nothing silver: it was not reckoned in the days of Solomon for any thin
For a ship of Tharshish to the king in the sea with the ship of Hiram: one for three years will come, a ship of Tharshish lifting up gold and silver and ivory and apes and peacocks.
And king Solomon will be magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
And all the earth are seeking the face of Solomon to hear his wisdom which God gave in his heart.
And they were bringing each his gifts, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments and weapons and spices, horses, and mules, the word of a year in a year.
And Solomon will gather together chariots and horsemen: and there will be to him a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he will set them down in the cities of chariots and with the king in Jerusalem.
And the king will give silver in Jerusalem, as stones, and cedars he gave as sycamores which are in the plain for multitude.
And a going forth of horses out of Egypt to Solomon, and a caravan of the king's merchants will take the caravan at a price.
And a chariot will go up and come forth out of Egypt with six hundred of silver, and a horse at fifty and a hundred: and thus for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Aram, by their hand they will bring forth.
And king Solomon loved many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites;
From the nations which Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you: surely they will turn your heart after their gods: to these Solomon joined to love.
And there will be to him seven hundred chief wives, and three hundred concubines: and his wives will turn his heart.
And it will be at the time of the old age of Solomon his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as the heart of David his father.
And Solomon will go after Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
And Solomon will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will not fill up after Jehovah as David his father.
Then Solomon will build a height for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the mountain which is upon the face of Jerusalem, and for the king, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
And thus he did for all his strange wives, they burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.
And Jehovah will be angry with Solomon, for his heart was turned from Jehovah the God of Israel, being seen to him twice.
And he commanded him concerning this word not to go after other gods: and he watched not what Jehovah commanded.
And Jehovah will say to Solomon, Because this was with thee, and thou didst not watch my covenant and my laws which I commanded upon thee, rending, I will rend the kingdom from thee and give it to thy servant.
But in thy days I will not do it for sake of David thy father; out of the hand of thy son will I rend it.
But I will not rend all the kingdom; one tribe I will give to thy son for sake of David my servant, and for sake of Jerusalem which I chose.
And Jehovah will raise up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he from the king's seed in Edom.
And it will be in David's being in Edom, and in Joab the chief of the army going up, he came to bury the slain, and he will strike every male in Edom;
(For six months Joab dwelt there and all Israel, till he cut off every male in Edom.)
And Hadad will flee, he and the men, Edomites, his father's servants, with him to go to Egypt; and Hadad a small boy.
And they will rise from Midian and come to Paran: and they will take men with them from Paran, and they will go to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he will give to him a house and spake bread for him, and gave to him land.
And Hadad will find favor in the eyes of Pharaoh greatly, and he will give to him a wife, sister of his wife, sister of Tahpenes the mistress.
And the sister of Tahpenes will bare to him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes will wean him in the midst of Pharaoh's house: and Genubath will be in Pharaoh's house in the midst of Pharaoh's sons.
And Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay down with his fathers, and that Joab chief of the army died, and Hadad will say to Pharaoh, Send me away, and I will go to my land.
And Pharaoh will say to him, For what lackest thou with me, and behold thee seeking to go to thy land? and he will say, Naught: but sending, thou shalt send me away.
And God will raise up to him an adversary, Rezon, son of Eliadah, who lied from Hadadezer king of Zobah his lord.
And he will gather to himself men, and he will be chief of a troop in David's killing them; and they will go to Damascus and dwell in it and reign in Damascus.
And he will be an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, and the evil which Hadad did: and he will abhor against Israel and he will reign over Aram.
And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, and his mother's name Zeruah, a widow woman, servant to Solomon, and he will lift up the hand against the king.
And this the word for which he lifted up the hand against the king: Solomon built the fortress and shut up the breaches of the city of David his father.
And the man Jeroboam mighty of strength: and Solomon will see the boy that he did work, and he will appoint him for the burden of the house of Joseph.
And it will be in that time, and Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite will find him going in the way; and he being covered with a new garment; and they two alone in the field.
And Ahijah will lay hold upon the new garment which was upon him and will rend it in twelve rents:
And he will say to Jeroboam, Take to thee ten rents: for thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Behold me rending the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I gave to thee ten tribes:
(And the one tribe shall be to him, for sake of my servant David, and for sake of Jerusalem the city which I chose in it from all the tribes of Israel:)
Because they forsook me and worshiped to Ashtaroth the god of Zidon, and to Chemosh, god of Moab, and to Milcom, god of the sons of Ammon, and they went not in my way to do the straight in mine eyes, and my laws and my judgments as David his father.
And I will not take all the kingdom from his hand, for I will set him chief all the days of his life for sake of David my servant whom I chose him, because he watched my commands and my laws.
And I took the kingdom from the hand of his son and gave it to thee, the ten tribes.
And to his son I will give one tribe on account of there being a light to David my servant all the days before me in Jerusalem the city which I chose to me to put my name there.
And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all which thy soul shall desire, and be king over Israel.
And being if thou shalt hear all that I shall command thee, and go in my way and do the straight in mine eyes to watch my laws and my commands as David my servant did, and I was with thee and built to thee a faithful house as I built to David, and I gave Israel to thee.
And I will humble the seed of David for this, but not all the days.
And Solomon will seek to kill Jeroboam, and Jeroboam will rise and flee to Egypt to Shishak, king of Egypt, and he will be in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
And the remainder of the words of Solomon and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written upon the book of the words of Solomon?
And the days which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.
And Solomon will lie down with his fathers and be buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son will reign instead of him.
And Rehoboam will go to Shechem, for to Shechem came all Israel to make him king.
And it will be when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard and he yet in Egypt where he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;
And they will send and call for him: and Jeroboam and all the convocation of Israel will come and speak to Rehoboam, saying,
Thy father made our yoke hard and now do thou lighten from the hard service of thy father, and from the heavy yoke which he gave upon us, and we will serve thee.
And he will say to them, Go ye, until three days, and turn back to me. And the people will go.
And king Rehoboam will consult the old men which were standing before Solomon his father in his being alive saying, How advise ye to turn back this people word?
And they will speak to him, saying, If this day thou wilt be a servant to this people and serve them, and answer them, and speak to them good words, and they were servants to thee all the days.
And he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled him, and he will consult with the children which grew up with him which were standing before him.
And he will say to them, What do ye advise? and we will turn back word to this people who spake to me, saying, Lighten from the yoke which thy father gave upon us.
And the children which grew up with him will speak to him, saying, Thus shalt thou say to this people who spake to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou lighten from upon us; thus shalt thou speak to them, My littleness thick above my father's loins.
And now my father loaded upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add upon your yoke: my father chastised you with whips and I will chastise you with scorpions.
And Jeroboam and all the people will come to Rehoboam in the third day, as the king spake, saying, Turn back to me in the third day.
And the king will answer the people hard, and he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled him;
And he will speak to them according to the counsel of the children, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add upon your yoke: my father chastised you with whips and I will chastise you with scorpions.
And the king heard not to the people, for the turn was from Jehovah for sake of lifting up his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
And all Israel will see that the king heard not to them, and the people will turn back the king word, saying, What part to us in David? and no inheritance in the son of Jesse: to thy tents, O Israel: now see to thy house, David. And Israel will go to their tents.
And the sons of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam will reign over them.
And king Rehoboam will send Adoram who was over the tribute, and all Israel will stone upon him with stone, and he will die. And king Rehoboam strengthened himself to go up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
And Israel will break with the house of David even to this day.
And it will be when all Israel heard that Jeroboam turned back, and they will send and call him to the assembly, and they will make him king over all Israel, and there was none after the house of David except the tribe of Judah alone.
And Rehoboam will come to Jerusalem, and he will convoke together all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen to make war to fight with the house of Israel to turn back the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
And the word of God will be to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,
Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the remainder of the people, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not go up and ye shall not fight with your brethren, sons of Israel: turn back each to his house, for this word was from me. And they will hear the word of Jehovah and turn back to go according to the word of Jehovah.
And Jeroboam will build Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwell in it; and he will go forth from there and build Penuel.
And Jeroboam will say in his heart, Now will the kingdom turn back to the house of David.
If this people shall go up to do sacrifices in the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, and the heart of this people turned back to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and killing me, and they turned back to Rehoboam king of Judah.
And the king will consult and make two calves of gold, and he will say to them, Much for you going up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And he will set up the one in the house of God, and the one he gave in Dan.
And this word will be for sin: and the people will go before the one, even to Dan.
And he will make a house of heights, and be will make priests from the ends of the people who were not of the sons of Levi.
And Jeroboam will make a festival in the eighth month, in the fifteenth day of the month, according to the festival that is in Judah, and he will go up upon the altar. Thus he did in the house of God to sacrifice to the calves which he made: and he placed in the house of God priests of the heights which he made.
And he brought up upon the altar which he made m the house of God, in the fifteenth day, in the eighth month, in the month which he devised of himself; and he will make a festival to the sons of Israel: and he will go up upon the altar to burn incense.
And behold a man of God came out of Judah in the word of Jehovah to the house of God; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
And be will call upon the altar in the word of Jehovah, and he will say, O altar, altar! thus said Jehovah, Behold, a son was born to the house of David, Josiah his name; and he sacrificed upon thee, the priests of the heights burning incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
And, he will give in that day a sign, saying, This the sign which Jehovah spake: Behold, the altar rent and the fat which was upon it, poured out.
And it will be when the king heard the word of the man of God which he called upon the altar in the house of God; and Jeroboam will stretch forth his hand from above the altar, saving, Seize him. And his hand which he stretched forth upon him will be dried up, and he will not be able to turn it back to him.
And the altar was rent, and the fat will be poured out from the altar according to the sign that the man of God gave by the word of Jehovah.
And the king will answer and say to the man of God, Supplicate the face of Jehovah thy God, and pray for me, and my hand shall be turned back to me And the man of God will supplicate the face of Jehovah, and the king's hand will turn back to him and be as in the beginning.
And the king will speak to the man of God, Come with me to the house, and be strengthened, and I will give to thee a gift.
And the man of God will say to the king, If thou wilt give to me half thy house I will not go with thee, and I will not eat bread and I will not drink water in this place:
For thus it was commanded me by the word of Jehovah, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, and thou shalt not drink water, and thou shalt not turn back in the way which thou camest.
And he will go in another way, and he turned not back in the way which he came in it to the house of God.
And one prophet, an old man, dwelt in the house of God; and his sons will come and relate to him all the work which the man of God did that day in the house of God: the words which he spake to the king, and they will relate them to their father.
And their father will speak to them, What way went he? and his sons will see the way that the man of God went who came from Judah.
And he will say to his sons, Saddle for me the ass: and they will saddle for him the ass and he will ride upon it.
And he will go after the man of God, and he will find him sitting under an oak: and he will say to him, Thou the man of God who came from Judah? And he will say, I.
And he will say to him, Go with me to the house and eat bread.
And he will say, I shall not be able to turn back with thee and to go with thee: and I will not eat bread and I will not drink water with thee in this place:
For it was spoken to me by the word of Jehovah, Thou shalt not eat bread and thou shalt not drink water there, thou shalt not turn back to go in the way which thou wentest in it.
And he will say to him, I also a prophet as thou; and a messenger spake to me in the word of Jehovah, saying, Turn him back with thee to thy house; and he shall eat bread and drink water. Lying to him.
And he will turn back with him and eat bread in his house, and drink water.
And it will be, they sitting at the table, and the word of Jehovah will be to the prophet who turned him back:
And he will call to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou didst imbitter the mouth of Jehovah and didst not watch the command, which Jehovah thy God commanded thee,
And thou wilt turn back and eat bread and drink water in the place which he spake to thee, Thou shalt not eat bread and thou shalt not drink water; thy corpse shall not come to the grave of thy fathers.
And it will be after his eating bread and after his drinking, and he will saddle for him the ass for the prophet which he turned back.
And he will go, and a lion will find him in the way and kill him: and his corpse will be cast in the way, and the ass standing by it, and the lion standing by the corpse.
And behold, men passing by, and they will see the corpse cast in the way, and the lion standing by the corpse: and they will come and speak in he city where the prophet, the old man, dwelt in it.
And the prophet that brought him back from the way will hear, and say, It is the man of God who resisted the mouth of Jehovah, and Jehovah will give him to the lion, and he will break him, and he will kill him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake to him.
And he will speak to his sons, saying, Saddle for me the ass. And they will saddle him.
And he will go and find his corpse cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion ate not the carcass and brake not the ass.
And the prophet will lift up the corpse of the man of God and place it upon the ass, and he will turn him back: and the prophet, the old man, came to the city, and he will mourn and he will bury him.
And he will lay it down in his grave, and they will mourn over him, Alas, my brother!
And it will be after they buried him, he will say to his sons, saying, In my dying and ye shall bury me in the grave which the man of God was buried in it; by his bones place my bones.
For being, the word shall be which he cried by the word of Jehovah upon the altar which is in the house of God, and upon all the houses of the heights which are in the cities of Shomeron.
After this word Jeroboam turned not back from his evil way, and he will turn back and make from the ends of the people, priests of the heights: him desiring he will fill his hand, and he will be priest of the heights.
And in this word it will be for sin to the house of Jeroboam, and to cut off and to destroy from the face of the earth.
In that time Abijah son of Jeroboam was sick.
And Jeroboam will say to his wife, Arise, now, and change thyself, and they will not know that thou art the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold there Ahijah the prophet; he spake concerning me for king over this people.
And take in thy hand ten of bread and crumb cakes, and a bottle of honey, and go to him: he will announce to thee what will be to the boy.
And Jeroboam's wife will do so, and she will rise and go to Shiloh, and she will come into the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah will not be able to see; for his eyes stood from his old age.
And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam coming to seek word from thee for her son, for he was sick: according this and according to this shalt thou speak to her: and it will be as she comes, and she dissembles.
And it will be when Ahijah heard the voice of her feet coming into the door, and he will say, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; wherefore this thou dissemblest? and I send to thee hard things.
Go say to Jeroboam, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Because I raised thee up from the midst of the people, and I will give thee chief over my people Israel,
And I will rend the kingdom from the house of David, and I will give it to thee: and thou wert not as my servant David who watched my commands and who went after me with all his heart to do only the straight in mine eyes;
And thou wilt be evil doing above all who were before thee: and thou wilt go and make to thee other gods, and molten things to irritate me, and didst cast me behind thy back.
For this, behold me bringing evil to the house of Jeroboam, and I cut off to Jeroboam him pissing against the wall, the shut up and the forsaken in Israel, and I took away after the house of Jeroboam as dung shall be taken away till its finishing.
Him dying to Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him dying in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah spake.
And arise, thou, go to thy house: in the coming of thy feet to the city and the child died.
And all Israel mourned for him, and they buried him: for this alone to Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because there was found in him a good word to Jehovah God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
And Jehovah raised up to him a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: and what? also now.
And Jehovah smote Israel as a reed will be shaken in the water, and he plucked up Israel from this good land which he gave to their fathers, and he scattered them from beyond the river, because they made their images, irritating Jehovah.
And he will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam who sinned, and who caused Israel to sin.
And Jeroboam's wife will arise and go, and come to Tirzah: she came upon the threshold of the house, and the boy died.
And they will bury him; and all Israel will mourn for him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
And the remainder of the words of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold them written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel.
And the days which Jeroboam reigned, twenty and two years, and he will lie down with his fathers; and Nadab his son will reign in his stead.
And Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. The son of forty and one years was Rehoboam in his reigning; and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah chose to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel: and the name of his mother Naamah, the Ammonitess.
And Judah will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will provoke him to jealousy above all which their fathers did in the sins which they sinned.
And they will also build to them heights and statues, and pillars, upon every high hill, and, under every green tree.
And also there was a holy place in the land; and they did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
And it will be in the fifth year to king Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
And he will take the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king's house; and he took all: and he took all the shields of gold which Solomon made.
And king Rehoboam will make in their stead shields of brass, and appointed upon the hand of the chief of the runners watching the door of the house of the king.
And it will be whenever the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners will lift them up and they turned them back to the runner's chamber.

Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother Maachah, daughter of Abishalom.
And he went in all the sins of his father which he did before him: and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah as the heart of David his father.
For on account of David, Jehovah his God gave to him a light in Jerusalem, to raise up a son after him, to cause Jerusalem to stand:
Because David did the right in the eyes of Jehovah, and turned not aside from all which he commanded all the days of his life, only in the word of Uriah the Hittite.
And war was between Rehoboam and between Jeroboam all the days of his life.
And the remainder of the words of Abijam, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah? and war was between Abijam and Jeroboam.

And he will take away the holy places from the land, and he will turn aside all the blocks which his fathers made.
And also Maachah, his mother, he will turn aside from being mistress, because she made terror to a statue; and Asa will cut off her terror, and burn by the torrent Kidron.
And the heights were not turned aside: but Asa's heart was perfect with Jehovah all his days.
And he will bring in the holy things of his fathers, and his holy things to the house of Jehovah, silver and gold and vessels.
And war was between Asa and between Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
And Baasha, king of Israel, will come up against Judah, and he will build Ramah, so that he will not give to go out or to come in to Asa king of Judah.
And Asa will take all the silver and the gold being left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house, and he will give them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa will send them to the son of Hadad, son of Tabrimon, son of Hezion, king of Aram, dwelling in Damascus, saying,
A covenant between me and between thee, between my father and between thy father: behold, I sent to thee a gift of silver and gold; go break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he will go up from me.
And the son of Hadad will hear to king Asa, and he will send the chiefs of the forces which were to him against the cities of Israel, and he will strike Ijon and Dan, and the meadow of the House of Oppression, and all Cinneroth with all the land of Naphtali.
And it will be when Baasha heard, and he will leave off building Ramah, and he will dwell in Tirzah.
And king Asa caused all Judah to hear; none free: and they will lift up the stones of Ramah and its woods which Baasha built, and king Asa will build with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpeh.

And Baasha son of Ahijah, to the house of Issachar, will conspire against him; and Baasha will strike him in Gibbethon, which is to the rovers; for Nadab and all Israel pressed upon Gibbethon.
And Baasha will kill him in the third year to Asa king of Judah, and he will reign in his stead.
And it will be when he reigned, he struck all the house of Jeroboam; he left not any breathing to Jeroboam, till he destroyed him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he caused Israel to sin, in his irritation which he irritated Jehovah the God of Israel.

Because I raised thee up from the dust, and I will give thee chief over my people Israel, and thou wilt go in the way of Jeroboam, and cause my people Israel to sin, to irritate me in their sins.
Behold me taking away after Baasha, and after his house; and I gave thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
Him dying to Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him dying to him in the field, shall the birds of the heavens eat.

And it will be when Zimri saw that the city was taken, and he will come to the fortress of the king's house, and he will burn over him the king's house with fire, and he will die,
For his sins which he sinned to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to go in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sins which he did to cause Israel to sin.
And the rest of the words of Zimri and his conspiracy which he conspired, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
Then the people of Israel will be divided to half: half of the people were after Tibni, son of Ginath, to make him king; and half, after Omri.
And the people will be strengthened which were after Omri over the people which were after Tibni son of Ginath: and Tibni will die, and Omri will reign.

And the word of Jehovah will be to him, saying,
Go from hence and turn to thyself east, and hide by the torrent Cherith which is before Jordan.

Arise, go to Zarephath which is to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I commanded a widow woman to nourish thee there.

And she will go to take, and he will call to her and say, Take now to me a bit of bread in thy hand.
And she will say, Jehovah thy God lives, if there is to me a cake, but a handful of flour in a bucket, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold me gathering two woods, and I went to do it for me and for my son, and we shall eat and die.
And Elijah will say to her, Thou shalt not fear; go and do according to thy word: but make to me from thence a little cake at first, and bring forth to me, and for thee and for thy son thou shalt make at last.
For thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, The bucket of flour shall not be spent, and the cruse of oil shall not fail until the day Jehovah shall give rain upon the face of the earth.
And she will go and do according to the word of Elijah: and she will eat, she and he, and her house, days.

And it will be after these words, the son of the woman, the lady of the house, was sick, and his sickness was very strong till that breath was not left in him.
And she will say to Elijah, What to me and to thee, thou man of God? camest thou to me to bring to remembrance mine iniquity, and to kill my son?
And he will say to her, Give to me thy son. And he will take him from her bosom and bring him up into an upper chamber where he sat there, and he will lay him upon his bed.
And he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God, didst thou also do evil upon the widow which I dwelt with her to kill her son?
And he will measure upon the child three times, and he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God wilt thou turn back now the soul of this child within his inner part?
And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Elijah, and he will turn back the soul of the child within his inner part, and he will live.
And Elijah will take the child and bring him down from the upper chamber of the house, and give him to his mother: and Elijah will say, See, thy son lives.
And the woman will say to Elijah, Now this I know that thou a man of God, and the word of Jehovah in thy mouth, truth.

And Elijah will go to be seen to Ahab. And the famine strong in Shomeron.
And Ahab will call for Obadiaha who was over the house. (And Obadiaha was fearing Jehovah greatly:
And it will be in Jezebel's cutting off the prophets of Jehovah, and Obadiaha will take a hundred prophets, and hide fifty men in a cave, and he nourished them with bread and water.)
And Ahab will say to Obadiaha, Go into the land to all the fountains of waters, and to all the torrents; perhaps we shall find grass and preserve alive the horse and the mule, and we shall not be cut off from the cattle.
And they will divide the land to them to pass over in it: Ahab went in one way by himself, and Obadiaha went went in one way by himself.
And Obadiaha will be in the way, and behold, Elijah to his meeting: and he will behold him and fall upon his face, and say, Art thou this my lord Elijah?
And he will say to him, I. go say to thy lord, Behold, Elijah.
And he will say, What did I sin that thou gavest thy servant into the hand of Ahab to kill me?
Jehovah thy god lives if there is a nation and kingdom where my lord did not send there to seek thee: and they said, No; and he caused the kingdom and nation to swear that they shall not find.
And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold Elijah.
And being I shall go from thee and the spirit of Jehovah will lift thee up where I shall not know; and I went to announce to Ahab, and he will not find thee, and he will kill me: and thy servant feared Jehovah from my youth.
Was it not announced to my lord what I did in Jezebel's killing the prophets of Jehovah, and I shall hide of the prophets of Jehovah a hundred men, fifty, fifty men in a cave, and I shall nourish them with bread and water?
And now thou sayest, Go, say to thy lord, Behold, Elijah; and he will kill me.
And Elijah will say to him, Jehovah of armies lives whom I stand before him that this day, I will be seen to him.
And Obadiaha will go to meet Ahab, and he will announce to him: and Ahab will go to meet Elijah.
And it will be when Ahab saw Elijah, and Ahab will say to him, This thou, troubling Israel?
And he will say, I troubled not Israel? but thou and thy father's house in your forsaking the commands of Jehovah, and thou wilt go after the Baals.
And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the pillar, four hundred, eating at the table of Jezebel.
And Ahab will send to all the sons of Israel and gather the prophets to mount Carmel.
And Elijah will draw near to all the people and say, How long halt ye upon two opinions? if Jehovah is God, go ye after him: and if Baal, go ye after him. And the people answered him not a word.
And Elijah will say to the people, I was left alone a prophet to Jehovah; and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty men.
And they shall give to us two bullocks; and they shall choose for themselves the one bullock, and cut it in pieces and put upon woods, and put no fire: and I will do the other bullock and give upon woods, and put no fire:
And call ye upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of Jehovah, and the God who shall answer by fire, he shall be God. And all the people will answer and say, Good the word.
And Elijah will say to the prophets of Baal, Choose for yourselves the one bullock, and do first, for ye are many; and call upon the name of your god, and ye shall not put fire.
And they will take the bullock which was given to them, and do, and they will call upon the name of Baal, from morning even to noon, saying, O Baal, answer us. And no voice, and none answered. And they will leap upon the altar which was made.
And it will be at noon, and Elijah will deride upon them, and he will say, Call with a great voice, for he a god: for he is talking, and because a withdrawing to him, and because a way to him, perhaps he is sleeping, and he will awake.
And they will call with a great voice, and they will cut themselves according to their judgment, with swords and with spears, even to the pouring out of blood upon them.
And it will be as the noon passed by, and they will prophesy even to the going up of the gift, and no voice, and none answered, and no attention.
And Elijah will say to all the people, Draw near to me. And all the people will draw near to him. And he will repair the altar of Jehovah, having been torn down.
And Elijah will take twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, whom was the word of Jehovah to him, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
And he will build with the stones an altar in the name of Jehovah: and he will make a channel, rolling up two measures of seed, round about the altar.
And he will put in order the woods, and he will cut the bullock in pieces and put upon the woods,
And he will say, Fill four buckets of water and pour upon the burnt-offering and upon the woods. And he will say, Do a second time. And they will do a second time. And he will say, Do a third time. And they will do a third time.
And the waters will go round about the altar; and he also filled the channel with water.
And it will be in the going up of the gift, and Elijah the prophet will draw near and say, Jehovah God of Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, this day it shall be known that thou art God in Israel, and I thy servant, and by thy words I did all these words.
Answer me, O Jehovah, answer me, and this people shall know that thou art Jehovah God, and thou didst turn their heart backwards.
And the fire of Jehovah will fall and will consume the burnt-offering and the woods, and the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the waters which were in the channel.
And all the people will see and fall upon their face, and say, Jehovah, he is God; Jehovah he is God.
And Elijah will say to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; a man shall not escape from them. And they will seize them, and Elijah will bring them down to the torrent Kishon, and they will slaughter them there.
And Elijah will say to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for a voice of a multitude of rain.
And Ahab will go up to eat and to drink. And Elijah will go up to the head of Carmel and prostrate himself upon the earth, and put his face between his knees.
And he will say to his boy, Go up now, look the way of the sea. And he will go up and look, and say, Not any thing. And he will say, Turn back seven times.
And it will be in the seventh, and he will say, Behold, a little cloud as the hand of a man, coming up from the sea. And he will say, Go up; say to Ahab, Harness; go down, and the rain shall not hinder thee.
And it will be even thus and even thus, and the heavens were darkened with clouds and wind, and there will be a great rain. And Ahab will ride and go to Jezreel.
And the hand of Jehovah was to Elijah; and he will bind up his loins, and he will run before Ahab, even to thy Coming to Jezreel.
And Ahab will announce to Jezebel all that Elijah did, and all how he killed all the prophets with the sword.
And Jezebel will send a messenger to Elijah, saying, Thus will God do and thus will he add that according to the time to-morrow I will set thy soul as the soul of one of them.
And he will see and arise, and go for his soul, and he will come to the Well of the Oath which was to Judah, and he will leave his boy there.
And he went into the desert the way of a day, and he will come and sit under one broom-tree: and he will ask for his soul to die: and he will say, Much now, O Jehovah, Take my soul, for I am not good above my fathers.
And he will lie down and sleep under one broom-tree, and behold, then a messenger touched upon him, and he will say to him, Arise, eat.
And he will look, and behold, from his head cakes baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water: and he will eat and drink, and turn back and lie down.
And the messenger of Jehovah will turn back the second time, and he will touch upon him, and say, Arise, eat, for much for thee the way.
And he will rise and eat and drink, and go in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, even to the mountain of God, Horeb.
And he will go there into a cave and lodge there; and behold, the word of Jehovah to him, and he will say to him, What to thee here Elijah?
And he will say, Being zealous I was zealous for Jehovah the God of armies: for the sons of Israel forsook thy covenant; they tore down thine altars, and thy prophets they killed with the sword, and I alone shall be left; and they will seek my soul to take it.
And he will say, Go forth and stand upon the mountain before Jehovah And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind weakening the mountains, and breaking the rocks before Jehovah; Jehovah not in the wind: and after the wind, a shaking; Jehovah not in the shaking:
And after the shaking, a fire; Jehovah not in the fire: and after the fire, a voice of light stillness.
And it will be when Elijah heard, he will cover his face in his large cloak, and he will go forth and stand at the opening of the cave; and behold, to him a voice, and it will say, What to thee here, Elijah?
And he will say, Being zealous, I was zealous for Jehovah the God of armies, for the sons of Israel forsook thy covenant; thine altars they tore down, and thy prophets they killed with the sword, and I alone shall be left; and they will seek my soul to take it.
And Jehovah will say to him, Go, turn back to thy way of the desert of Damascus: and come and anoint Hazael for king over Aram:
And Jehu, son of Nimshi, shalt thou anoint for king over Israel: and Elisha son of Shaphat, from Abel-Meholah, It thou anoint for prophet in thy stead.
And it was him escaping from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu kill: and him escaping from the sword of Jehu, shall Elisha.
And I left in Israel seven thousand, all the knees which bowed not to Baal, and every mouth which kissed him not.
And he will go from thence and find Elisha son of Shaphat, and he ploughed with twelve yoke before him, and he with the twelve: and Elijah will pass away by him, and he will cast his wide cloak to him.
And he will forsake the oxen and run after Elijah, and say, I will kiss now to my father and to my mother, and I will go after thee. And he will say to him, Go, turn back; for what did I to thee?
And he will turn back from after him and take a yoke of oxen and sacrifice them, and with the instruments of the oxen he boiled them the flesh, and he will give to the people, and they will eat. And he will rise and go after Elijah and serve him.
And the son of Hadad, king of Aram, gathered all his strength; and thirty and two kings with him, and horses and chariots: and he will go up and press upon Shomeron and war against her.
And he will send messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, to the city,
And he will say to him, Thus said the son of Hadad, Thy silver and thy gold it is to me; and thy wives and thy sons, the good, they are to me.
And the king of Israel will answer and say, According to thy word, my lord the king, to thee am I and all which is to me.
And the messengers will turn back and say, Thus said Ben-hadad, saying, That I sent to thee, saying, Thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy sons thou shalt give to me,
But about the time to-morrow I will send my servants to thee, and they searched thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it was all the delight of thine eyes they shall put in their hand and take.
And the king of Israel will call for all the old men of the land, and he will say, Know now, and see that this seeks evil, for he sent to me for my wives and for my sons, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I withheld not from him.
And all the old men and all the people will say to him, Thou shalt not hear, and thou shalt not be willing.
And he will say to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Say to my lord the king, All which thou sentest to thy servant at first, I will do: and this word I shall not be able to do. And the messengers will go and turn back word.
And Ben-hadad will send to him and say, Thus will the gods do to me, and thus will they add, if the dust of Shomeron shall suffice for handfuls for all the people which are at my feet.
And the king of Israel will answer and say, Speak ye. He binding shall not boast as he loosening.
And it will be when he heard this word he was drinking, and the kings in the booths; and he will say to his servants, Set ye. And they will set against the city.
And behold, one prophet drew near to Ahab king of Israel, and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, Sawest thou all this great multitude? Behold me giving it into thy hand this day and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
And Ahab will say, By whom? And he will say, Thus said Jehovah, By the boys of the chiefs of the provinces. And he will say, Who shall bind the war? And he will say, Thou.
And he will review the boys of the chiefs of the provinces, and they will be two hundred and thirty: and after them he reviewed all the people, all the sons of Israel, seven thousand.
And they will go forth at noon. And Ben-hadad was drinking strong drink in the booths, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings helping him.
And the boys of the chiefs of the provinces will go forth at the first; and Ben-hadad will send and they will announce to him, saying, Men came forth from Shomeron.
And he will say, If for peace they came forth, seize them living; and if for war they came forth, seize them living.
And these came forth from the city, the boys of the chiefs of the provinces, and the strength which was after them.
And they will strike a man his man: and Aram will flee, and Israel will pursue them: and Ben-hadad king of Aram, will escape upon a horse, and the horsemen.
And the king of Israel will go forth and strike the horse and the chariot, and he struck upon Aram a great blow.
And the prophet will draw near to the king of Israel, and say to him, Go, be strengthened, and know, and see what thou wilt do: for at the return of the year the king of Aram will come up against thee.
And the servants of the king of Aram said to him, A god of the mountains is their God; for this they were strong above us; and on the contrary, we will war with them in a plain; surely, shall we not be strong above them?
And do this word, Remove the kings a man from his place, and put prefects in their stead.
And thou shalt divide out to thee an army, as the army having fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will war with them in the plain; surely, shall we not be strong above them? And he will hear to their voice and do so.
And it will be at the return of the year, and Ben-hadad will review Aram, and he will go up to Aphek to the war with the king of Israel.
And the sons of Israel were reviewed, and were nourished, and they will go up to their meeting: and the sons of Israel will encamp over against them as two flocks of she goats; and Aram filled the land.
And a man of God will come near and say to the king of Israel, and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, Because Aram said, A God of the mountains is Jehovah, and he is not the God of the valleys, and I gave all this great multitude into thy hand; and know ye that I am Jehovah.
And these will encamp over against those seven days. And it will be in the seventh day, and the battle will draw near: and the sons of Israel will strike Aram a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
And the rest will flee to Aphek, to the city; and the wall will fall upon twenty and seven thousand men being left And Ben-hadad fled, and he will come to the city, to a chamber in a chamber.
And his servants will say to him, Behold now, we heard that the kings of the house of Israel that they are kings of mercy; we will now put sackcloth upon our loins and ropes upon our heads, and we will go forth to the king of Israel; perhaps he will save alive thy soul.
And they will bind sackcloth upon their loins, and ropes upon their heads, and they will come to the king of Israel, and say, Thy servant Ben-hadad said, Now wilt thou save alive my soul? And he will say, Is he yet living? he is my brother.
And the men will prognosticate, and hasten, and urge whether it was from him, and they will say, Thy brother Benhadad. And he will say, Go take him. And Benhadad will come forth to him, and he will bring him up upon his chariot.
And he will say to him, The cities which my father took from thy father, I will turn back; and thou shalt set streets for thee in Damascus, according as my father set in Shomeron. And I will send thee away with a covenant. And he will cut out to him a covenant and send him away.
And a man, one of the sons of the prophets, said to his neighbor in the word of Jehovah, Strike me now. And the man refused to strike him.
And he will say to him, Because thou heardst not to the voice of Jehovah, behold thee going from me, and the lion striking thee. And he will go from beside him, and the lion will find him and strike him.
And he will find another man, and he will say, Strike me now. And the man will strike him, striking and wounding.
And the prophet will go and stand by the king by the way; and he will be disguised with a bandage over his eyes.
And it will be the king passing by, and he cried to the king, and he will say, Thy servant went forth into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and he will bring a man to me, and say, Watch this man: if missing, he shall be missed, and thy soul being instead of his soul, or thou shalt weigh a talent of silver.
And it will be thy servant doing here and there, and he was not. And the king of Israel will say to him, Thus thy judgment; thou didst decide.
And he will hasten and remove the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel will know him that he is from the prophets.
And he will say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou sentest away a man I devoted to destruction from thy hand, and thy soul being instead of his soul, and thy people instead of his people.
And the king of Israel will go to his house, rebellious and angry; and he will come to Shomeron.
And it will be after these words, and a vineyard was to Naboth the Jezreelite which was in Jezreel, by the palace of Ahab king of Shomeron.
And Ahab will speak to Naboth, saying, Wilt thou give to me thy vineyard? and it shall be to me for a garden of herbs, for it is near by my house: and I will give to thee in its stead a vineyard good above it; if good in thine eyes I will give thee silver the price of this.
And Naboth will say to Ahab, Far be it to me from Jehovah, my giving the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
And Ahab will come to his house rebellious and angry for the word that Naboth the Jezreelite spake to him: and he will say, I will not give to thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he will lie down upon his bed and turn away his face, and not eat bread.
And Jezebel his wife will come to him, and she will speak to him, What this thy spirit rebellious, and thou not eating bread?
And he will speak to her, Because I shall speak to Naboth the Jezreelite and say to him, Thou shalt give to me thy vineyard for silver; or if thou art willing, I will give to thee a vineyard in its stead. And he will say, I will not give to thee my vineyard.
And Jezebel his wife will say to him, Thou now wilt do the kingdom over Israel: arise, eat bread, and do thy heart good: I will give to thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
And she will write letters in the name of Ahab, and seal with his seal; and she will send the letters to the old men, and to the nobles who were in his city dwelling with Naboth.
And she will write in the letters, Saying, Call a fast; set Naboth in the head of the people:
And set two men, sons of Belial, over against him, and they shall bear witness, saying, Thou didst praise God and the king. And they shall bring him forth and stone him, and he shall die.
And the men of his city, the old men and the nobles, who were dwelling in his city, will do as Jezebel sent to them, according to what was written in the letters which she sent to them.
They called a fast; they will set Naboth upon the head of the people.
And two men will come, sons of Belial, and they will set before him: and the men of Belial will testify against Naboth before the people, saying, Naboth praised Jehovah and the king. And they will bring him without the city, and stone him with stones, and he will die.
And they will send to Jezebel, saying, Naboth was stoned, and he will die.
And it will be when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and he will die, and Jezebel will say to Ahab, Arise, inherit the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give to thee for silver: for Naboth is not living, but dead.
And it will be when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, and Ahab will rise to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, and to possess it.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Shomeron: behold, in the vineyard of Naboth where he went down there to possess it.
And speak to him, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Didst thou kill and also possess? And speak to him, saying, said Jehovah, In the place which the dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick thy blood, also thine.
And Ahab will say to Elijah, Didst thou find me, O mine enemy? And he will say I found: because thou didst sell thyself to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah,
Behold me bringing evil to thee, and I took away after thee, and I cut off to Ahab him pissing against a wall and him shut up and left in Israel;
And I gave thy house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha, son of Ahijah, for the irritation which thou didst irritate, and thou wilt cause Israel to sin.
And also to Jezebel spake Jehovah, saying, Dogs shall eat Jezebel in the fortification of Jezebel.
Him dying to Ahab in the city shall dogs eat; and him dying in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.
Only there was not as Ahab who was sold to do evil in the eves of Jehovah, whom Jezebel stimulated him.
And he will cause abhorrence exceeding to go after blocks, according to all which the Amorites did whom Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
And it will be when Ahab heard these words, and he will rend his garments, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and he will fast and lie down in sackcloth, and go softly.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
Thou sawest that Ahab humbled himself from before me. Because that he humbled himself from before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: in the days of his sons I will bring the evil upon his house.
And they will dwell three years, no war between Aram and between Israel.
And it will be in the third year, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to the king of Israel.
And the king of Israel will say to his servants, Ye knew that to us Ramoth-Gilead, and we being inactive taking it from the hand of the king of Aram.
And he will say to Jehoshaphat, Go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead. And Jehoshaphat will say to the king of Israel, As me, as thee; as my people, as thy people; as my horses, as thy horses.
And Jehoshaphat will say to the king of Israel, Seek now, according to the day, the word of Jehovah.
And the king of Israel will gather together the prophets, about four hundred men, and he will say to them. Shall I go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall I desist? and they will say, Go up; and Jehovah will give into the hand of the king.
And Jehoshaphat will say, Is there not here yet a prophet to Jehovah, and we will seek from him?
And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Yet one man to seek Jehovah from him, and I hated him, for he will not prophesy good concerning me, but evil, Micaiah, son of Imlah And Jehoshaphat will say, The king shall not say thus.
And the king of Israel will call for one eunuch, and say, Hasten, Micaiah, son of Imlah.
And the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, sitting each upon his throne, putting on their garments in the area of the opening of the gate of Shomeron; and all the prophets prophesying before them.
And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, will make to him horns of iron: and he will say, Thus said Jehovah, With these shalt thou push Aram till thou finished them.
And all the prophets prophesying thus, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead and prosper: and Jehovah gave into the hand of the king.
And the messenger who went to call Micaiah, spake to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets of one mouth good to the king: will thy words now be according to the word of one of them, and speak thou good?
And Micaiah will say, Jehovah lives, for what Jehovah shall say to me I will speak it.
And he will come to the king, and the king will say to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-Gilead to war, or shall we desist? And he will say to him, Go up, and prosper: and Jehovah gave into the hand of the king.
And the king will say to him, Till how many times do I cause thee to swear that thou wilt not speak to me only truth in the name of Jehovah?
And he will say, I saw all Israel scattered to the mountains as sheep which not to them a shepherd: and Jehovah will say, No lords to these; they shall turn back a man to his house in peace.
And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say to thee he will not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
And he will say, For this, hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the army of the heavens standing by him from his right hand and from his left.
And Jehovah will say, Who will deceive Ahab, and he shall go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? and this will say according to this, and this said according to this.
And the spirit will go forth and stand before Jehovah, and he will say, I will deceive him. And Jehovah will say, By what?
And he will say, I will go forth and be to him a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he will say, Thou shalt deceive, and thou shalt be able: go forth and do thus.
And now behold, Jehovah gave a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and Jehovah spake evil concerning thee.
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah will come near, and strike Micaiah upon the cheek, saying, Where passed the spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?
And Micaiah will say, Behold thee seeing in that day when thou shalt go into a chamber, in a chamber to hide thyself.
And the king of Israel will say, Take Micaiah and turn him back to Amon, chief of the city, and to Joash son of the king.
And say, Thus said the king, Put this in the house of shutting up, and cause him to eat the bread of oppression and the waters of oppression till my coming in peace.
And Micaiah will say, If turning back, thou shalt turn back in peace, Jehovah spake not in me. And he will say, Hear, ye peoples, all of them.
And the king of Israel will go up, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, to Ramoth-Gilead.
And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Disguising myself and going into the war; and thou put on thy garments. And the king of Israel will see himself, and will go into the war.
And the king of Aram commanded the chiefs of the chariots which were to him, thirty and two, saying, Ye shall not fight with little and with great, but with the king of Israel alone.
And it will be when the chiefs of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, and they said, Surely he is the king of Israel. And they will turn aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat will cry out.
And it will be when the chiefs of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, and they will turn back from after him.
And a man drew with a bow in his simplicity, and he will strike the king of Israel between the joinings and between the coat of mail; and he will say to his driver, Turn thy hand, and bring me forth from the war, for I was wounded.
And the battle will go up in that day: and the king was fixed in the chariot over against Aram, and he will die in the evening: and the blood of the wound will flow into the bosom of the chariot.
And a shout of joy will pass through in the camp as the sun went down, saying, A man to his city, and a man to his land.
And the king will die, and he will be brought to Shomeron; and they will bury the king in Shomeron.
And one will inundate the chariot in the pool of Shomeron; and the dogs will lick his blood; and the harlots washed, according to the word of Jehovah which he spake.
And the rest of the words of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house, which he built, and all the cities which he built, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
And Ahab will lie down with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son will reign in his stead.
And Jehoshaphat son of Asa, reigned over Judah in the fourth year to Ahab king of Israel.
Jehoshaphat the son of thirty and five years in his reigning; and twenty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.
And he went in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it to do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah: But the heights were not removed; the people yet sacrificing and burning incense upon the heights.
And Jehoshaphat will make peace with the king of Israel.
And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, and his strength that he did, and how he warred, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And the remainder of the holy place which was left in the days of Asa his father, he took away from the land.
And a king not in Edom: a director reigned.
Jehoshaphat built ships of Tharshish to go to Ophrah for gold: and it went not, for the ships were broken in Ezion-Geber.
Then said Ahaziah son of Ahab, to Jehoshaphat, My servants shall go with thy servants in the ships. And Jehoshaphat would not.
And Jehoshaphat will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son will reign in his stead.
And Ahaziah son of Ahab reigned over Israel in Shomeron in the seventeenth year to Jehoshaphat king of Judah; and he will reign over Israel two years.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah and go in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin:
For he will serve Baal and worship to him, and he will irritate Jehovah the God of Israel according to all which his father did.
And Moab broke with Israel after Ahab died.
And Ahaziah will fall through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Shomeron, and he will be sick: and he will send messengers, and say to them, Go seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron, if I shall live from this disease.
And the messenger of Jehovah spake to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to the meeting of the messengers of the king of Shomeron, and speak to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel ye go to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron?
And for this, thus said Jehovah, The bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, but dying, thou shalt die, and Elijah will go.
And the messengers will turn back to him, and he will say to them, Why this ye turned back?
And they will say to him, A man came up to our meeting, and he will say to us, Go, turn back to the king who sent you, and speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, Is it because there is no God in Israel thou sentest to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron? for this the bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, for dying, thou shalt die.
And he will speak to them, What the judgment of the man who came up to your meeting, and he will speak to you these words?
And they will say to him, A man possessing hair, girded with a girdle of skin upon his loins. And he will say, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
And he will send to him a chief of fifty and his fifty. And he will go Up to him; and behold, he sat upon the head of the mountain. And he will speak to him. Thou man of God, the king spake, Come down.
And Elijah will answer and speak to the captain of fifty, If I a man of God, fire shall come down out of the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty. And fire will come down from the heavens and consume him and his fifty.

Behold, fire will come down from heaven and consume the two first captains and their fifties: and now shall my soul be precious in thine eyes?
And the messenger of Jehovah will speak to Elijah, Go down with him: thou shalt not be afraid of his face. And he will rise and go down with him to the king.
And he will speak to him, Thus said Jehovah, Because thou didst send messengers to seek in Baal the fly god of Ekron, Is it because there is no God in Israel to seek in his word? for this, the bed where thou wentest up there, thou shalt not come down from it, for dying, thou shalt die.
And he will die according to the word of Jehovah which Elijah spoke. And Jehoram will reign in his stead in the second year to Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; for there was no son to him.
And the rest of the words of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel?
And it will be in Jehovah bringing up Elijah in a tempest to the heavens, and Elijah went up, and Elisha, from Gilgal.

And Elijah will take his wide cloak and roll together, and strike the waters, and they will be divided hence and thence, and they two will pass through into the desert.
And it will be as they passed through and Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee before I shall be taken from thee. And Elisha will say, Now shall the mouth of two in thy spirit be to me.
And he will say, Thou wert hard to ask: if thou shalt see me taken from thee, it shall be thus to thee; and if not, it shall not be.
And it will be they went, going speaking, and behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and they will separate between them two; and Elijah will up in a tempest to the heavens.
And Elisha saw, and he crying, My father, my father! the chariot of Israel and his horsemen! and he saw him no more: and he will lay hold upon his garments and rend them into two rents.
And he will lift, up the wide cloak of Elijah which fell from above him, and he will turn back and stand by the lip of Jordan.
And he will take the wide cloak of Elijah which fell from off him and strike the waters, and say, Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah, even he? And he will strike the waters and they will divide hence and thence, and Elisha will pass through.

And they will say to him, Behold now, there is with thy servants fifty men, sons of strength: they shall go now and seek thy lord, lest the spirit of Jehovah lifted him up, and it will cast him upon one of the mountains or into one of the valleys. And he will say, Ye shall not send.
And they will press upon him till he was ashamed, and he will say, Send. And they will send fifty men; and they will seek three days, and they found not.
And they will turn back to him, and he sitting in Jericho; and he will say to them, Did I not say to you, Ye shall not send?
And the men of the city will say to Elisha, Behold the situation of the city good, as my lord sees: and the waters evil and the land barren.
And he will say, Take to me a new dish, and put salt there. And they will take to him.
And he will go forth to the going forth of the waters, and he will cast salt there, and be will say, Thus said Jehovah, I healed these waters; there shall be no more from thence death and barren.
And the waters will be healed even to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.
And he will go up from thence to the house of God: and he going up in the way, and little boys will come forth from the city, and will scoff at him, and say to him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
And he will turn behind him and see them, and he will curse them in the name of Jehovah. And, two she-bears will come forth from the forest and will rend of them forty and two children.
And he will go from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he turned back to Shomeron.
And Jehoram son of Ahab reigned over Israel in Shomeron in the eighteenth year to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he will reign twelve years.

Then Rezin king of Aram will go up, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem to war: and they will press upon Ahaz, and they will not be able to fight.
In that time Rezin king of Aram turned back Elath to Aram, and he will cast out the Jews from Elath, and the Aramites came to Elath and dwelt there even to this day.
And Ahaz will send messengers to lath-Pileser, king of Assur, saying, I thy servant and thy son: come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram, and out of the hand of the king of Israel rising up against me.
And Ahaz will take the silver and the gold found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house, and send a gift to the king of Assur.
And the king of Assur will hear to him and the king of Assur will come up to Damascus and seize it, and carry the city into exile; and he killed Rezin.
And king Ahaz will go up to the meeting of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assur to Damascus, and he will see an altar which was in Damascus: and king Ahaz will send to Urijah the priest a likeness of the altar and its structure, for all its work.
And Urijah the priest will build an altar according to all which king Ahaz sent from Damascus: thus did Urijah the priest till the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.
And the king will come from Damascus, and the king will see the altar: and the king will come near upon the altar, and he will bring up upon it.
And he will burn his burnt-offering and his gift, and will pour out his libation, and sprinkle the blood of the peace, which were to him, upon the altar.
And the altar of brass which was before Jehovah, and he will bring from the face of the house from between the altar and from between the house of Jehovah, and he will give it upon the thigh of the altar to the north.
And king Ahaz will command him, Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the burnt-offering of the morning, and the gift of the evening, and the king's burnt-offering and his gift, and the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their gifts and their libations, and all the blood of the burnt-offering and all the blood of the sacrifice: thou shalt sprinkle upon it and the altar of brass shall be to me for the morning.
And Urijah the priest will do according to all which king Ahaz commanded.
And king Ahaz will cut off all the enclosings of the bases, and he will remove from off them the wash-basin; and he will take down the sea from off the oxen of brass which was under it, and he will give it upon a pavement of stones.
And the shelter of the Sabbath which they built in the house, and the entrance of the king without, he turned from the house of Jehovah from the face of the king of Assur.
And the rest of the words of Ahaz which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And Ahaz will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son will reign in his stead.
In the twelfth year to Ahaz king of Judah, reigned Hoshea son of Elah, in Shomeron over Israel nine years.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not as the kings of Israel which were before him.
Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Amur; and Hoshea will be to him a servant, and he will turn back to him a gift.
And the king of Assur will find conspiracy in Hoshea, because he sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and he brought up no gift to the king of Assur, as year by year; and the king of Assur will surround him and bind him in the house of shutting up.
And the king of Assur will come up upon all the land, and he will comp up to Shomeron, and press upon her three years.
In the ninth year to Hoshea the king of Assur took Shomeron, and he will carry Israel into exile to Assur, and set them in Halah and in Habor, the river of Gozan, and the cities of the Medes.
And it will be that the sons of Israel sinned against Jehovah their God, having brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and they will fear other gods.
And they will go in the laws of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel, and the kings of Israel which they made.
And the sons of Israel will cover the words not thus concerning Jehovah their God, and they will build to them heights in all their cities from the tower of those watching even to the fortified city.
And they will set to them statues and images upon every high hill, and under every green tree.
And they will burn incense there in all the heights as the nations which Jehovah carried into exile from their face; and they will do evil words to irritate Jehovah:
And they will serve blocks which Jehovah said to them, Ye shall not do this word.
And Jehovah will testify in Israel and in Judah by the hand of all his prophets, all seeing, saying, Turn back from your evil ways and watch my commands, my laws according to all my instruction which I commanded your fathers, and which I Sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets.
And they heard not, and they will harden their neck as the neck of their fathers who did not believe in Jehovah their God.
And they will reject his laws and his covenant which he cut out with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified in them; and they will go after vanity, and they will be vain, and after the nations which were round about them which Jehovah commanded them not to do as they.
And they will forsake all the commands of Jehovah their God, and make to them a molten thing, two Calves; and they will make images, and they will worship to all the army of the heavens, and serve Baal.
And they will cause their sons and their daughters to pass through in fire, and divine divinations and enchantments, and they will be sold to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to Irritate him.
And Jehovah will be greatly angry against Israel, and he will remove them from his face: not to leave only the tribe of Judah alone.
Also Judah watched not the commands of Jehovah their God, and they will go in the laws of Israel which they made.
And Jehovah will reject in all the seed of Israel, and will afflict them, and he will give them into the hand of plunderers, till he cast them from his face.
For he rent Israel from above the house of David; and they will make Jeroboam son of Nebat, king; and Jeroboam will thrust out Israel king after Jehovah, and he caused them to sin a great sin.
And the sons of Israel will go in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they turned not away from them;
Till Jehovah removed Israel from his face, as he spake by the hand of all his servants the prophets. And he will carry Israel into exile from his land to Assur, even to this day.
And the king of Assur will come from Babel and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and sepharvaim, and he will set in the cities of Shomeron instead of the sons of Israel: and they will possess Shomeron and dwell in her cities.
And it will be in the beginning of their dwelling there, they will not fear Jehovah; and Jehovah will send against them lions, and they will be killing among them.
And they will say to the king of Assur, saying, The nations which thou carriedst into exile, and thou wilt set in the cities of Shomeron, knew not the judgment of the God of the land, and he will send among them lions, and behold them slaying them because they knew not the judgment of the God of the land.
And the king of Assur will command, saying, Carry there one of the priests which ye brought from thence; and they shall go and dwell there, and he shall teach them the judgment of the God of the land.
And one of the priests which they carried into exile from Shomeron will come and dwell in the house of God, and he will be teaching them how they shall fear Jehovah.
And the nation, nation, will be making his gods, and will put in the house of the heights which the Samaritans made, nation, nation, in their cities which they dwell there.
And the men of Babel made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath, made Ashima.
And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites were burning their sons in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
And they will be fearing Jehovah, and make to them priests of their ends upon the heights, and they will be doing to them in the houses of the heights.
They were fearing Jehovah, and were serving their gods according to the judgment of the nations who carried them into exile from thence,
Even to this day they are doing according to the former judgments: they not fearing Jehovah, and not doing according to their laws and according to their judgments and according to the instruction and according to the command which Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he set his name Israel.
And Jehovah cut out a covenant with them, and he commanded them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, and ye shall not worship to them, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not sacrifice to them.
But Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an extended arm, him shall ye fear, and to him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye sacrifice.
And the laws and the judgments, and the instruction and command which he wrote for you, ye shall watch to do all the days; and ye shall not fear other gods.
And the covenant which I cut out with you ye shall not forget; and ye shall not fear other gods.
But Jehovah your God ye shall fear, and he shall deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.
And they did not hearken, but! they were doing according to their former judgments.
And these nations were fearing Jehovah and were serving their carved images, also their sons and their sons sons; as their fathers did, they are doing even to this day.
And it will be in the third year to Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, reigned Hezekiah son of Ahaz, king of Judah.
The son of twenty and five years, was he in his reigning; and twenty and, nine years reigned he in Jerusalem and his mothers name Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which, David his father did.
He removed the heights, and he brake in pieces the statues, and he cut off the image, and he beat down the serpent of brass which Moses made: for till those days the sons of Israel were burning incense to it and they called it brass.
And he trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel; and after him was not like him among all the kings of Judah, and who were before him.
And he will cleave upon Jehovah he turned not away from after him, and he will watch his commands which Jehovah commanded Moses.
And Jehovah was with him: in all which he will go forth he will prosper; and he will rebel against the king of Assur, and not serve him.
He struck the rovers even to Azzah, and her bounds from the tower of those watching to the fortified city.
And it will be in the fourth year to king Hezekiah, this the seventh year to Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assur, came up against Shomeron and pressed, upon it.
And he will take it from the end of three years: in the sixth year to Hezekiah, this the ninth year to Hoshea, king of Israel, Shomeron was taken.
And the king of Assur will carry Israel into exile to Assur, and put them in Halah and Habor, the river of Gihon, and the cities of the Medes:
Because they heard not to the voice of Jehovah their God, and they will pass by his covenant, all which Moses commanded, the servant of Jehovah, and they heard not and did not.
And in the fourteenth year to Hezekiah, Senherib, king of Assur, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will seize them.
And Hezekiah king of Judah will send to the king of Assur to Lachish, saying, I sinned; turn back from me: what thou givest upon me I will bear. And the king of Assur will put upon Hezekiah three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
And Hezekiah will give all the silver found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasures of the king's house.
In that time Hezekiah broke off the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and the supporters which Hezekiah king of Judah overlaid, and he will give them to the king of Assur.
And the king of Assur will send Tartan, Rab-Saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah, with weighty strength to Jerusalem; and they will go up and come to Jerusalem: and they will go up and come and stand by the aqueduct of the highest pool in the highway of the field of the fuller.
And they will call for the king, and there will go forth to them Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph reminding.
And Rabshakeh will say to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assur, What this confidence in which thou trustedst?
Thou saidst (but a word of the lips) Counsel and strength for war Now upon whom didst thou trust that thou rebelledst against me?
Now behold, thou trustedst to thyself, upon the stay of this broken reed, upon Egypt, which a man shall lean upon it and it will go into his hand and bore it; thus Pharaoh king of Egypt to all trusting upon him.
And if ye shall say to me, We trusted to Jehovah our God: is it not he of whom Hezekiah turned away his heights and his altars, and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
And now become surety to my lord the king of Assur, and I will give to thee two thousand horses if thou shalt be able to give to thyself riders upon them.
And how wilt thou turn back the face of one prefect of my lord's servants of the least, and wilt thou trust to thyself upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Now came I up without Jehovah upon this place to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, will say, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak now to thy servants in Syriac; for we hear: and thou shalt not speak with us in Judaic in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.
And Rabshakeh will say to them, To thy lord and to thee did my lord send me to speak these words? is it not to the men sitting upon the wall to eat their dung and to drink their piss with you?
And Rabshakeh will stand and call with a great voice in Judaic, and speak and say, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assur:
Thus said the king, Hezekiah shall not be lifted up to you: for he shall not be able to deliver you from my hand:
And Hezekiah shall cause you to trust to Jehovah, saying, Delivering, Jehovah will deliver us, and this same city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
Ye shall not hear to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assur, Make me a gift, and come forth to me, and eat ye a man his vine and a man his fig tree, and drink ye a man water of his well,
Till my coming and I took you to a land as your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey; and live ye, and ye shall not die: and ye shall not hear to Hezekiah, for he will seduce you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
Delivering, did the gods of the nations deliver each his hand out of the hand of the king of Assur?
Where the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? for did they deliver Shomemn out of my hand?
Who of all the gods of the lands who delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah shall deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
And the people were silent and answered him not a word: for it was the command of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer.
And there came Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph reminding, to Hezekiah, their garments rent; and they will announce to him the words of Rabshakeh.
And it will be when King Hezekiah heard and he will rend his garments and cover himself with sackcloth, and go into the house of Jehovah.
And he will send Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the old men of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos.
And they will say to him, Thus said Hezekiah, A day of straits and chastisement and reproach this day: for the sons came to the breaking forth, and no strength to her bringing forth.
Perhaps Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh which the king of Assur his lord sent him to reproach the living God; and he will decide upon the words which Jehovah thy God beard: and lift thou up a prayer for the remnant being found.
And the servants of the king Hezekiah will come to Isaiah.
And Isaiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to your lord, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not be afraid from before the words which thou heardest with which the boys of the king of Assur reviled me.
Behold me giving upon him a spirit, and he heard a hearing, and he turned back to his land; and I caused him to fall by the sword in his land.
And Rabshakeh will turn back and find the king of Assur warring against Libnah: for he heard that he removed from Lachish.
And he will hear Tirhakah king of Cush, saying, Behold, he came forth to war with thee: and he will turn back and send messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Thy God will not lift thee up whom thou trustest in him, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
Behold, thou heardest what the kings of Assur did to all lands to destroy them: and shalt thou be delivered?
Did the gods of the nations deliver them which my fathers destroyed Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden who were in Thelasar?
Where the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king to the city of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah?
And Hezekiah will receive the letters from the hand of the messengers, and read them: and he will go up to the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah will spread it out before Jehovah.
And Hezekiah will pray before Jehovah, and say, O Jehovah God of Israel, dwelling upon the cherubim; thou God himself alone to all the kingdoms of the earth; thou madest the heavens and the earth.
O Jehovah, incline thine ear and hear; O Jehovah open thine eyes and see: and hear the words of Senherib, which sent him to reproach the living God.
Indeed, O Jehovah, the kings of Assur laid waste the nations and their land.
And they gave their gods into fire, for they were not gods, but the work of the hands of man, wood and stone: and they will destroy them.
And now, O Jehovah our God, save us now out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou Jehovah art God alone.
And Isaiah son of Amos will send to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, What thou hast prayed to me against Senherib king of Assur, I heard.
This the word which Jehovah spake concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion despised, she derided thee; after thee the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head.
Whom didst thou reproach and revile? and against whom didst thou lift up the voice, and thou wilt lift up thine eyes on high against the holy one of Israel?
By the hand of thy messengers thou didst reproach Jehovah, and thou wilt say, With the chariot of my horseman I came up upon the height of the mountains of the sides of Lebanon, and I said, I will cut off the height of the cedars and the chosen of its cypresses: and I will go in to the lodging-place of the extremity of the forest of its Carmel.
I dug and drank the waters of strangers, and I will dry up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of the fortress.
Didst thou not hear from remoteness I made it from days before and I formed it? and now I brought it in, and thou wilt be to set fortified cities for desolate ruins.
And the inhabitants were short of hand, they were terrified and they were ashamed; they were the grass of the field and the green herbage, and the grass of the roofs, and blasted before it rose up.
And thy sitting and thy going out and thy coming in I knew, and thy wrath against me.
Because thy wrath against me, and thine arrogance came up into mine ears, and I put my hook in thy nose and my bit into thy lips, and I turned thee back in the way which thou camest in it.
And this the sign to thee, to eat this year things growing spontaneously, and in the second year, things springing up, and the third year, sow ye and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruits.
And the escaping of the house of Judah being left shall add a root downward, and make fruit above.
For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and an escaping from mount Zion: the zeal of Jehovah will do this.
Therefore, thus said Jehovah to the king of Assur, He shall not come into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, and a shield shall not come before it, and he shall not cast a mound against it.
In the way in which be shall come in it he shall turn back, and to this city he shall not come in, says Jehovah.
And I protected this city, to save it for my sake and for sake of David my servant.
And it will be in that night the messenger of Jehovah will strike in the camp of Assur, a hundred eighty and five thousand; and they will rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them dead corpses.
And Senherib king of Assur will turn away and go and turn back and dwell in Nineveh.
And he will be worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword: and they escaped to the land of Ararat: and Esarhaddon his son will reign in his stead.
In those days Hezekiah was sick to death; and Isaiah son of Amos the prophet will come in to him, and he will say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Command to thy house, for thou art dying, and thou shalt not live.
And he will turn his face to the wall and pray, saying,
O Jehovah, remember now how I went before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and I did the good in thine eyes. And Hezekiah will weep a great weeping.
And it will be Isaiah went not forth to the city of the middle, and the word of Jehovah was to him, saying,
Turn back and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people, Thus said Jehovah, God of David thy father, I heard thy prayer, I saw thy tears: behold me healing thee: in the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah.
And I added to thy days fifteen years; and from the hand of the king of Assur I will deliver thee and this city; and I protected this city for my sake, and for sake of David my servant.
And Isaiah will say, Take a round mass of figs. And they will take and put upon the burning sore, and he will live.
And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, What the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and I went up in the third day to the house of Jehovah?
And Isaiah will say, This the sign to thee from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the word which he spake: the shadow going ten steps, or shall it turn back ten steps?
And Hezekiah will say, A light thing to the shadow to bow ten steps: nay, for the shadow shall turn backwards ten steps.
And Isaiah the prophet will call to Jehovah, and he will turn back the shadow in the steps which went down, in the steps of Ahaz, backwards ten degrees.
In that time Berodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babel, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah was sick.
And Hezekiah will hear to them, and caused them to see all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the good oil, and all the house of his vessels, and all which was found in his treasures: and there was not a word which Hezekiah caused them not to see in his house, and in all his dominion.
And Isaiah the prophet will come to king Hezekiah and say to him, What said these men? and from whence will they come to thee? and Hezekiah will say to him, From a land far off came they, from Babel.
And he will say, What saw they in thy house? And Hezekiah will say, All which is in the house they saw; there was not a word which I caused them not to see in my treasures.
And Isaiah will say to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah.
Behold, the days coming, and there was lifted up all which was in thy house, and what thy fathers treasured up, even to this day, to Babel: not a word shall be left, said Jehovah.
And from thy sons which shall go forth from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall be taken; and they were eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babel.
And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, Good the word of Jehovah which thou spakest And he will say, Shall not peace and truth be in my days?
And the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and all his powers, and how he made the pool and the aqueduct, and he will bring waters to the city, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.
Manasseh the son of twelve years in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Hephzibah.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.
And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father destroyed; and he will raise up altars to Baal, and make a statue as did Ahab king of Israel; and he will worship to all the army of the heavens, and serve them.
And he built altars in the house of Jehovah where Jehovah said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.
And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
And he caused his sons to pass through in fire, and he practiced magic, and took auguries, and made necromancy and a wizard spirit: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate.
And he will set up a carved thing of the image which he made in the house, of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever:
And I will not add to move the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers; only if they will watch to do according to all I commanded them, and for all the instructions which Moses my servant commanded them.
But they heard not, and Manasseh will cause them to go astray to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from the face of the sons of Israel.
And Jehovah will speak by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,
Because Manasseh king of Judah did these abominations, doing evil above all which the Amorites did that were before him, and he will also cause Judah to sin with his blocks:
For this, thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Behold me bringing evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, which all hearing it, his two ears shall tingle.
And I stretched over Jerusalem the cord of Shomeron, and the weight of the house of Ahab: and I wiped off Jerusalem as one will wipe dishes, wiping, and turning upon its face.
And I thrust out the remainder of my inheritance, and I gave them into the hand of their enemies; and they were for plunder and for a prey to all their enemies.
Because they did evil in mine eyes, and they will be irritating me from the day which their fathers came forth out of Egypt, and even to this day.
And also Manasseh poured out innocent blood exceeding much, till he filled Jerusalem mouth to mouth; besides his sins which he caused Judah to sin to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sins which he sinned, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and will be buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzzah: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father.
And he will go in all the ways which his father went, and he will serve the blocks which his father served, and he will worship to them.
And he will forsake Jehovah the God of his fathers, and he went not in the way of Jehovah.
And the servants of Amon will conspire against him, and they will kill the king in his house.
And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.
And the rest of the words of Amon which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And he will be buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzzah; and Josiah his son will reign in his stead.
The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and go in all the way of David his father, and he turned not aside to the right or the left.
And it will be in the eighteenth year to king Josiah, the king sent Shaphen son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe of the house of Jehovah, saying,
Go up to Hilkiah the great priest, and he shall complete the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, which the watchers of the threshold gathered from the people.
And they shall give it into the hand of those appointed in the house of Jehovah: and they shall give it to those doing the work which is in the house of Jehovah to strengthen the breach of the house.
To the artificers, and to the builders and the wall builders, and to buy woods and stones hewn to strengthen the house.
But the silver given into their hand will not be reckoned with them, for they do in faith.
And Hilkiah the great priest will say to Shaphan the scribe, I found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah, and Hilkiah will give the book to Shaphan and he will read it.
And Shaphan the scribe will come to the king, and he will turn the king back word, and he will say, Thy servants melted the silver found in the house, and they will give it into the hand of those doing the work being appointed in the house of Jehovah.
And Shaphan the scribe will announce to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest gave to me a book, and Shaphan will read it before the king.
And it will be when the king heard the words of the book of the law, and he will rend his garments.
And the king will command Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor, son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah the king's servant, saying,
Go ye, seek Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words of this book being found: for great the anger of Jehovah burning upon us because that our fathers heard not to the words of this book to do according to all written concerning us.
And Hilkiah the priest went, and Ahikam and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, to Huldah the prophetess wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, watching the garments; (and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second rank;) and they will speak to her.
And she will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Say ye to the man who sent you to me.
Thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to this place, and upon its inhabitants all the words of the book which the king of Judah read.
Because they forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods to irritate me in all the work of their hands; and my wrath burnt upon this place and it shall not be quenched.
To the king of Judah sending you to seek Jehovah, thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The words which thou heardest;
Because thy heart was tender and thou wilt be humble from before Jehovah in thy hearing what I spake against this place, and against its inhabitants to be for desolation, and for a curse, and thou wilt rend thy garments and weep before me; and I also heard, says Jehovah.
For this, behold me gathering thee to thy fathers, and thou wert gathered to thy tomb in peace; and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evil which I bring upon this place. And they will turn back the king word.
And the king will send and gather to him all the old men of Judah and Jerusalem.
And the king will go up to the house of Jehovah and all the men of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests and the prophets, and all the people to the small, and even to the great: and he will read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant found in the house of Jehovah.
And the king will stand by the pillar, and he will cut out a covenant before Jehovah to go after Jehovah, and to watch his commands and his testimonies and his laws, with all the heart and with all the soul, and to raise up the words of this covenant written upon this book. And all the people will stand in the covenant.
And the king will command Hilkiah the great priest and the priests of the second rank, and the watchers of the threshold to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels being made for Baal and for the image, and for all the army of the heavens: and they will burn them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and he lifted up their dust to the house of God.
And he caused the obscurations to cease which the kings of Judah gave, and he will burn incense in the heights in the cities of Judah, and those being round about Jerusalem, and those burning incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the army of the heavens.
And he will bring forth the image from the house of Jehovah from without Jerusalem to the torrent Kidron, and he will burn it by the torrent Kidron, and he will beat small to dust and cast the dust upon the grave of the sons of the people.
And he will break down the houses of the holy places, which were in the house of Jehovah, where the women wove there houses for the image.
And he will bring all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defile the heights where the priests burnt incense there from the hill even to the Well of the Oath, and he brake down the heights of the gates which were at the door of the gate of Joshua chief of the city which were at the left of a man in the gate of the city.
But the priests of the heights will not come up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate the unleavened in the midst of their brethren.
And he defiled Topheth in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, for a man not to cause his son and his daughter to pass through in fire to the king.
And he will take away the horses which the kings of Judah gave to the sun at the going in of the house of Jehovah into the chamber the king gave the eunuch which was in the open portico, and he burnt the chariots of the sun in fire.

And the heights which were before Jerusalem which were from the right to the mount of destruction which Solomon king of Israel built to Ashtaroth the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and to Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon the king defiled.

And Josiah will turn and see the tombs which were there in the mount, and he will send and take the bones from the tombs and burn upon the altar, and he will defile it according to the word of Jehovah which the man of God called who called these words.
And he will say, What this pillar which I see? And the man of the city will say to him, The tomb of the man of God who came from Judah, and he will call these words which thou didst upon the altar of the house of God.
And he will say, Give rest to him; a man shall not move his bones; and they will let escape his bones and the bones of the prophet who came from Shomeron.
And also all the houses of the heights which were in the cities of Shomeron which the kings of Israel made to irritate, Josiah turned away, and he will do to them according to all the doings which he did in the house of God.
And he will sacrifice all the priests of the heights which were there upon the altars, and he will burn the bones of man upon them, and he will turn back to Jerusalem.
And the king will command all the people, saying, Do the passover to Jehovah your God, according to the writing upon the book of this covenant.
For there was not done according to this passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel and all the days of the kings of Israel, and the kings of Judah.
But in the eighteenth year to king Josiah was done this passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem.
And also the necromancers, and the wizards and the family gods, and the blocks, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, Josiah took away in order to set up the words of the law written upon the book which Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Jehovah.
And like him was there not a king before him who turned back to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there arose not like him.
But Jehovah turned not back from the burning of his great anger, his anger which kindled against Judah because of all the provocations with which Manasseh irritated him.
And Jehovah will say, I will also turn away Judah from my face, as I turned away Israel, and I rejected this city which I chose, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

And Jehovah will send against him troops of Chaldeans and troops of Aram, and troops of Moab, and troops of the sons of Ammon, and he will send them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servants the prophets.
But at the mouth of Jehovah it was upon Judah to turn away from his face through the sins of Manasseh, according to all which he did.
And also the innocent blood which he poured forth, (and he will fill Jerusalem with innocent blood) and Jehovah would not pardon.
And the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?
And Jehoiakim will lie down with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son will reign in his stead.

The son of twenty and one years was Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mothers name Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which Jehoiakim did.
For upon the wrath of Jehovah it was in Jerusalem and in Judah, till he cast them from his face, and Zedekiah will rebel against the king of Babel.
And it will be in the ninth year to his reigning, in the tenth month, in the tenth to the month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel came, he, and all his strength, against Jerusalem, and he will encamp against it, and build a watch tower against her round about.
And the city will go into siege till the eleventh year to king Zedekiah.

And the city will be broken up, and all the men of war by night the way of the gate between the walls by the king's garden: (and the Chaldees against the city round about;) and he will go the way of the sterile region.
And the strength of the Chaldees will pursue after the king, and they will overtake him in the sterile region of Jericho: and all his strength was scattered from him.
And they will seize the king and bring him up to the king of Babel to Riblah; and they will speak judgment with him.
And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah, and he will bind him with fetters, and bring him to Babel.
And in the fifth month, in the seventh to the month, (this year the nineteenth year to king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babel,) came Nebuzaradan, chief of the cooks, servant of the king of Babel, to Jerusalem.
And he will burn the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt in fire.
And the walls of Jerusalem round about, all the strength of the Chaldees which were with the chief of the cooks brake down.
And the rest of the people being left in the city, and those falling away which fell to the king of Babel, and the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried into exile.

And out of the city he took one eunuch, he who was appointed over the men of war, and five men seeing the face of the king, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the chief of the army mustering the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the city:
And Nebuzaradan, chief of the cooks, will take them and bring them to the king of Babel to Riblah:

Confess ye to Jehovah, call upon his name, make known among the peoples his deeds.
Sing ye to him, play on the harp to him, speak upon all his wonders.
Praise ye in his holy name: the heart of those seeking Jehovah shall rejoice.
Seek ye Jehovah and his strength, seek his face always.
Remember ye his wonders which he did, and his miracles, and the judgments of his mouth;
O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye sons of Jacob his chosen ones.
He Jehovah our God; in all the earth his judgments.
Remember ye forever his covenant; the word be commanded to a thousand generations;
Which he cut out with Abraham, and his oath to Isaak.
And he will cause it to stand to Jacob for a law, to Israel a covenant forever,
Saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the cord of your inheritance;
In your being men of number, as few, and strangers in it.
And they will go about from nation to nation, and from kingdom to another people;
And he permitted not to a man to oppress them: and for them he will reprove kings:
Ye shall not touch upon my Messiah, and upon my prophets ye shall not do evil.
Sing ye to Jehovah, all the earth; announce good news, from day to day his salvation.
Recount his glory among the nations; his wonders among all peoples.
For great is Jehovah, and greatly praised: and he to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples nothings: and Jehovah made the heavens.
Glory and honor before his face; strength and joy in his place.
Give to Jehovah ye families of the peoples, give to Jehovah glory and strength.
Give ye to Jehovah the glory of his name: lift up a gift and come before him: worship to Jehovah the ornaments of holiness.
Tremble from before him, all ye earth: also the habitable globe shall be set up, it shall not be shaken.
The heavens shall rejoice, and the earth shall exult: and they shall say among the nations, Jehovah reigned:
The sea shall tremble and its fulness, and the field shall rejoice and all that is in it.
Then shall the trees of the forest shout from the face of Jehovah, for he came to judge the earth.
Confess ye to Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy is forever.
And say ye, Save us, God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to confess to thy holy name, to glory in thy praise.
Praised be Jehovah God of Israel from forever and even to forever. And all the people will say, Amen, and praise to Jehovah.

And Nathan will say to David, Do all that is thy heart; for God is with thee.
And it will be in that night, and the word of God will be to Nathan, saying,
Go and say to David my servant, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not build to me a house to dwell in:
For I dwelt not in a house from the day that I brought up Israel even to this day: and I will be from tent to tent, and from a dwelling.
In all that I went about in all Israel, spake I the word with one of the judges of Israel that I commanded to feed my people, saying, Wherefore built ye not to me a house of cedars.
And now, thus shalt thou say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of armies, I took thee from the dwelling from behind the flocks to be leader over my people Israel:
And I will be with thee in all which thou walkedst, and I will cut off all thine enemies from thy face, and I made to thee a name as the name of the great ones which are in the earth.
And I set a place for my people Israel, and I planted him, and he dwelt in his place, and he shall no more be disturbed; and the sons of evil shall not add to vex him, as in the beginning.
And to the days which I commanded judges over my people Israel; and I brought low all thine enemies. And I will announce to thee, and Jehovah will build a house to thee.
And it was When thy days were completed to go with thy fathers, and I raised up thy seed after thee, which shall be from thy sons; and I prepared his kingdom.
He shall build to me a house, and I prepared his throne even to forever.
I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son: and my mercy will I not remove from him as I removed from him being before thee.
And I caused him to stand in my house and in my kingdom even to forever: and his throne shall be set up even to forever.
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan the prophet to David.
And king David will come and sit before Jehovah, and he will say, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what my house, that thou broughtest me even to hither?
And this will be small in thine eyes, O God; and thou wilt speak upon the house of thy servant to far off, and thou sawest me according to the manner of the man of the ascent, O Jehovah God.
What more shall David add to thee to honor thy servant? for thou knewest thy servant.
O Jehovah, for sake of thy servant, and according to thy heart, thou didst all this greatness to make known all thy greatnesses.
O Jehovah, none like thee, and no God besides thee, in all that we heard with our ears.
And what one nation as thy people Israel, in the earth, whom God went to redeem to him a people to set up to thee a name of greatnesses and terrible things, to thrust out nations from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?
And thou wilt give thy people Israel to thee for a people even to forever; and thou, O Jehovah, wert to them for God.
And now, O Jehovah, the word which thou spakest concerning thy servant and concerning his house, shall be faithful even to forever, and do as thou spakest.
And it shall be firm, and thy name shall be magnified even to forever, saying, Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, is God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant was prepared before thee.
For thou, my God, didst uncover the ear of thy servant to build for him a house: for this thy servant found to pray before thee.
And now, O Jehovah, thou thyself art God, and thou wilt speak concerning thy servant this goodness.
And now thou wert pleased to bless the house of thy servant, to be forever before thee: for thou didst bless, and blessing forever.

And Hanun will take David's servants and shave them, and cut off their garments in the half, even to the step, and he will send them away.

Be strong, and we will strengthen ourselves for our people and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah will do the good in his eyes.
And Joab will draw near, and the people which are with him, before Aram to battle; and they will flee from before him.

If three years of famine, and if three months of being destroyed from before thine adversaries, and the sword of thine enemies to overtake; and if three days the sword of Jehovah, and the word in the land, and the messenger of Jehovah destroying in all the bound of Israel. And now see what word I shall turn back to him sending me.
And David will say to Gad, Straits to me exceedingly: I will fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for his compassions are very many: and I will not fall into the hand of man.
And Jehovah will give death upon Israel: and there will fall from Israel seventy thousand men.
And God will send a messenger to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he destroyed, Jehovah saw, and he will grieve for the evil, and he will say to the messenger destroying, Enough; slacken thy hand. And the messenger of Jehovah stood by the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.
And David will lift up his eyes and see the messenger of Jehovah standing between the earth and between the heavens, and his sword drawn in his hand stretched forth over Jerusalem. And David will fall, and the old men being covered with sackcloth, upon their face.
And David will say to God, Is it not I who said to number in the people? and I am he who sinned, and doing evil I did evil; and these sheep, what did they? O Jehovah my God, thy hand now shall be upon me and upon my father's house; and not to smite upon thy people.
And the messenger of Jehovah said to Gad to say to David that David shall go up to set up an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.
And David will go up at the word of Gad which he spake in the name of Jehovah.
And Ornan will turn back and see the messenger; and his four sons with him hiding themselves. And Ornan treading out the wheat.
And David will go even to Ornan, and Ornan will look and see David, and he will go forth from the threshing-floor, and he will worship to David, the face to the earth.
And David will say to Ornan, Thou shalt give to me the place of the threshing-floor, and I will build in it an altar to Jehovah: for the full silver thou shalt give it to me, and the smiting shall be restrained from the people.
And Ornan will say to David, Take to thee, and my lord the king shall, do the good in his eyes: see, I gave the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing-sledges for woods, and the wheat for a gift; I gave all.
And king David will say to Ornan, Nay; for buying, I will buy for the full silver: for I will not lift up what is to thee to Jehovah, and bring up burnt-offerings gratuitously.
And David will give to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold from weight.
And David will build there an alter to Jehovah, and he will bring up burnt-offerings and peace, and will call to Jehovah; and he will answer him in fire from the heavens upon the altar of burnt-offering.
And Jehovah will say to the messenger, and he will turn back his sword to its sheath.
In that time in David's seeing that Jehovah answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, and he will sacrifice there.
And the dwelling of Jehovah which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of burnt-offering in that time in the height in Gibeon.
And David could not go before it to seek God, for he was afraid from the face of the sword of the messenger of Jehovah,
And David will say, This house itself of Jehovah God, and this the altar for burnt-offering to Israel.
And David will say to assemble the strangers which are in the land of Israel; and he will set up hewers of stone to hew out hewn stones to build the house of God.
And iron for abundance for nails for the doors of the gates, and for the junctions, David prepared; and brass for abundance no weight;
And cedar woods to no number: for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar woods for multitude to David.
And David will say, Solomon my son a youth and tender, and the house to be built for Jehovah to be great for going up for a name and for glory to all the lands: I will now prepare for it. And David will prepare for abundance before his death.
And he will call for Solomon his son, and he will command him to build a house to Jehovah God of Israel.
And David will say to Solomon his son, I, it was with my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.
And the word of Jehovah will be upon me, saying, Thou didst pour out blood for abundance, and didst make great wars: thou shalt not build a house for my name, for thou didst pour out many bloods in the earth before me.
Behold, a son being born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I caused rest to him from all his enemies from round about: for Solomon shall be his name, and I will give peace and quiet upon Israel in his days.
He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be to me for son, and I to him for father; and I prepared the throne of his kingdom over Israel even to forever.
Now, my son, Jehovah will be with thee; and prosper thou and build the house of Jehovah thy God as he spake concerning thee.
Surely Jehovah will give to thee wisdom and understanding, and he will command thee concerning Israel, and to watch the law of Jehovah thy God.
Then thou shalt prosper if thou shalt watch to do the laws and the judgments which Jehovah commanded Moses concerning Israel: be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be terrified.
And behold in my affliction I prepared for the house of Jehovah, gold, a hundred thousand talents, and silver, a thousand thousand talents; and for brass and for iron, no weight; for it was for abundance: and woods and stones I prepared, and upon them thou wilt add.
And with thee for abundance, they doing the work, hewers and workmen of stone and wood, and all the wise for all the work.
To gold, to silver, and to brass, and to iron, no number. Arise and do, and Jehovah will be with thee.
And David will command to all the chiefs of Israel for help to Solomon his son:
Is not Jehovah your God with you? and he caused rest to you from round about? for he gave into my hand the inhabitants of the land; and the land was subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
Now ye shall give your heart and your soul to seek to Jehovah your God; and arise ye and build the holy place of Jehovah God to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God, to the house being built to the name of Jehovah.
And David was old and full of days, and he will make Solomon his son king over Israel.
And he will gather together all the chiefs of Israel, and the priests and the Levites.
And the Levites will be numbered from the son of thirty years and above: and their number, for their craniums, for the men, thirty and eight thousand.
From these to superintend over the work of the house of Jehovah, twenty and four thousand; and scribes and judges, six thousand:
And four thousand gate keepers, and four thousand praising to Jehovah with instruments which I made to praise.

For David said, Jehovah God of Israel caused rest to his people, and they will dwell in Jerusalem forever;
And also to the Levites: not to lift up the dwelling and all its vessels for its service.
For by the last words of David these the number of the sons of Levi from the son of twenty years and above.

And God said to me, Thou shalt not build a house to my name, for thou a man of war, and thou didst pour out bloods.
And Jehovah God of Israel will choose in me from all the house of my father to be for king over Israel forever: for in Judah he chose for leader; and in the house of Judah the house of my father; and in the sons of my father he delighted in me to make a king over all Israel:
And from all my sons (for Jehovah gave to me many sons) and he will choose in Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah over Israel.
And he will say to me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my enclosures: for I chose in him to me for son, and I will be to him for father.
And I set up his kingdom even to forever, if he shall be strong to do my commands and my judgments as this day.
And now before the eyes of all Israel, the convocation of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, watch ye and seek all the commands of Jehovah your God, so that ye shall inherit the good land, and give an inheritance to your sons after you even to forever.
And thou, O Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing soul: for Jehovah searched all hearts, and he understands every formation of the thoughts: if thou shalt seek him he will be found to thee, and if thou wilt forsake him, he will cast thee off forever.
See now; for Jehovah chose in thee to build a house for a holy place: be strong and do.
And David will give to Solomon his son a pattern of the porch, and its houses, and its treasuries, and its upper chambers, and its apartments within, and the house of the expiation.
And the pattern of all that was in the spirit with him for the enclosures of the house of Jehovah, and for all the cells round about for the treasures of the house of God, and for the treasures of the holies:
And for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of the service of the house of Jehovah.
For the gold by weight for the gold, for all the vessels of service; and for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels of service and service:
And the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight of the candlestick and candlestick, and its lamps: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, for the candlestick and its lamps, according to the service of candlestick and candlestick.
And the gold of the weight for the tables of the arrangement for table and table; and silver for the tables of silver:
And the flesh-hooks, and the vases, and the bowls of pure gold, and for the cups of gold: by weight for cup and cup; and for the cups of silver by weight, for cup and cup.
And for the altar of incense of gold purified by weight; and for the pattern of the chariot of the Cherubim; gold for spreading and covering over the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
All in writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, causing to understand all the works of the pattern.
And David will say to Solomon his son, Be strong and be active, and do: thou shalt not fear, and thou shalt not be terrified, for Jehovah God, my God, is with thee; he will not be slack to thee, and he will not forsake thee till the finishing all the works of the service of the house of Jehovah.
And behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God: and with thee in all the work for every one willing in wisdom for all the service: and the chiefs and all the people for all thy words.
And David the king will say to all the convocation, Solomon my son, God chose in him alone, is a youth and tender, and the work great; for the fortress not for man but for Jehovah God.
And with all my power I prepared for the house of my God, gold for gold, and silver for silver, and brass for brass, and iron for iron, woods for woods, and stones of onyx, and the fillings up, and stones of paint and of variegation, and every precious stone, and stones of white marble for multitude.
And yet in my delighting in the house of my God, there is to me property of gold and silver I gave to the house of my God, to above from all I prepared for the holy house,
Three thousand talents of gold from gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of purified silver, to spread over the walls of the houses:
To gold for gold, and to silver for silver, and for all the work by the hand of artificers And who being willing for the filling up of his hand this day to Jehovah?
And the chiefs of the fathers will show themselves willing, and the chiefs of the tribes of Israel, and the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and for the chiefs of the king's work,
And will give for the service of the house of God, gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and silver ten thousand talents, and brass a myriad and eight thousand talents, and iron a hundred thousand talents.
And with whom stones being found they gave to the treasure of the house of Jehovah by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
And the people will rejoice for their showing themselves willing, for with the whole heart they showed themselves willing to Jehovah: and also David the king rejoiced with great gladness.
And David will praise Jehovah before the eyes of all the convocation: and David will say, Praised be thou, O Jehovah God of Israel our father, from forever and even to forever.
To thee, O Jehovah, the greatness and the strength, and the glory and the confidence, and the majesty: for all in the heavens and in the earth to thee, O Jehovah, the kingdom and being lifted up to all for head.
And riches and honor from before thee, and thou ruling over all, and in thy hand power and strength, and in thy hand to magnify and to strengthen to all.
And now, our God, we confess to thee, and praise to the name of thy glory.
And because who am I? and who my people, that we shall retain power to show ourselves willing according to this? for from thee all things, and from thy hand they gave to thee.
For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers: as a shadow our days upon the earth, and no expectation.
O Jehovah our God, all this multitude that we prepared to build to thee a house for thy holy name, it is from thy hand, and to thee the whole.
And I knew, my God, that thou triest the heart, and from uprightness thou wilt delight. I in the uprightness of my heart gave willingly all these: and now thy people were found here; I saw with gladness to show themselves willing to thee.
O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaak, and Israel, our fathers, watch this forever to the formation of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare for their heart to thee:
And to Solomon my son wilt thou give a whole heart to watch thy commands, thy testimonies, and thy laws, and to do the whole, and to build the fortress which I prepared.
And David will say to all the convocation, Praise ye now Jehovah your God. And all the convocation will praise to Jehovah the God of their fathers, and they will bow down and worship to God and the king.
And they will sacrifice sacrifices to Jehovah, and they will bring up burnt-offerings to Jehovah for the morrow of that day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, and their libations, and sacrifices for abundance for all Israel:
And they will eat and drink before Jehovah in that day with great gladness. And they will make the second time for Solomon son of David to be king, and they will anoint him to Jehovah for leader, and to Zadok for priest.
And Solomon will sit upon the throne of Jehovah for king instead of David his father, and he will prosper; and all Israel will hear to him.
And all the chiefs and the strong ones, and also all the sons of king David gave the hand under Solomon the king.

And the first and the last words of David the king, behold them written upon the words of Samuel the seer, and upon the words of Nathan the prophet, and upon the words of Gad the seer,

And the altar of brass which Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, made, he set before the dwelling of Jehovah: and Solomon and the convocation will seek it.
And Solomon will go up there upon the altar of brass before Jehovah, which is at the tent of appointment, and he will bring up a thousand burnt-offerings upon it.
In that night God was seen to Solomon, and he will say to him, Ask what I shall give to thee.
And Solomon will say to God, Thou didst great mercy with David my father, and hast caused me to reign in his stead.
Now, O Jehovah God, shall thy word with David my father be firm: for thou didst cause me to reign over a people a multitude as the dust of the earth.
Now wilt thou give to me wisdom and knowledge, and I shall go out before this people, and come in: for who shall judge this thy great people?
And God will say to Solomon, Because this was with thy heart, and thou askedst not riches, treasures and honor, and the soul of those hating thee, and also many days thou askedst not, and thou wilt ask for thee wisdom and knowledge that thou shalt judge my people that I caused thee to reign over them:
Wisdom and knowledge are given to thee; and riches and treasures and honor will I give to thee which was not thus to the kings that were before thee; and after thee it shell not be thus.

Forever this upon Israel.
And the house that I build is great: for great our God above all gods.
For who shall retain power to build for him a house? for the heavens and the heavens of the heavens shall not contain him: and who am I who shall build to him a house but to burn incense before him?
And now send to me a man wise to work in gold and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and cerulean purple, and knowing to engrave engravings with the wise which are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, which David my father prepared.
And send to me cedar trees and cypresses, and algum trees from Lebanon: for I knew that thy servants are knowing to cut trees of Lebanon; and behold, my servants with thy servants,

And Huram will say, Praised be Jehovah God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who gave to David the king a wise son, knowing intelligence and understanding, who will build a house to Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.
And now I sent a wise man knowing understanding to Huram my father,
The son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stones, and in woods, in purple, in cerulean purple, and in byssus, and in crimson; and to engrave every engraving, and to invent every work of art which shall be given to him, with thy wise ones, and the wise of my lord David thy father.
And now the wheat and the bailey and the oil and the wine which my lord said he will send to his servants;
And we will cut woods from Lebanon, according to all thy need: and we will bring them to thee in floats upon the sea of Joppa; and thou shalt bring them up to Jerusalem.
And Solomon will number all the men, the strangers which are in the land of Israel, after the numbering which David his father numbered them; and they will be found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
And he will make from them seventy thousand to carry, and eighty thousand hewing in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred superintending to cause the people to work.

Then Solomon will convoke together the old men of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers to the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the city of David; it is Zion.

Nothing in the ark only the two tables which Moses gave in Horeb when Jehovah cut out with the sons of Israel in their coming out of Egypt.
And it will be in the coming forth of the priests from the holy place, (for all the priests being found were consecrated not to watch to the divisions:
And the Levites, those singing to all them to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to then some and their brethren; being clothed with byssus, with cymbals and with lyres and harps, standing from the sunrising to the altar, and with them the priests to a hundred and twenty, trumpeting with trumpets:)
And it will be as one to those trumpeting and to those singing, to cause one voice to be heard to praise and to confess to Jehovah; and when lifting up the voice with the trumpets and with the cymbals and with the instruments of the song, and with praising to Jehovah, For he is good, for his mercy is forever: and the house was filled with a cloud, the house of Jehovah;
And the priests were not able to stand to serve from the face of the cloud, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.
Then said Solomon, Jehovah said to dwell in thick clouds.
And I built a house of habitation for thee, and a foundation for thy dwelling forever.
And the king will turn his face, and will bless all the convocation of Israel: and all the convocation of Israel stood.
And he will say, Praised be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and filled up with his hands, saying,
From the day, that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose not in a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I chose not in man to be leader over my people Israel.
And I will choose in Jerusalem for my name to be there; and I will choose in David to be over my people Israel.
And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.
And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was with thy heart.
But thou shalt not build the house; for thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.
And Jehovah will raise up the word that he spake: and I shall rise up instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel according to the word of Jehovah; and I will build the house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.
And there I will set the ark where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with the sons of Israel.
And he will stand before the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands:
For Solomon made a platform of brass, and he will give it in the midst of the terrace; five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height: and he will stand upon it, and he will bend upon his knees before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens,
And he will say, O Jehovah God of Israel, not as thee a God in the heavens and in the earth, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:
Who didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him; and thou wilt speak with thy month, and with thy hand thou wilt fill up, as this day.
And now Jehovah God of Israel, watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, A man shall not be cut off to thee from before me sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go in my law according as thou wentest before me.
And slow, O Jehovah God of Israel, thy word shall be firm which thou didst speak to thy servant, to David.
For indeed will God dwell with man upon the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens will not contain thee; much less this house which I built.
Turn to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee:
For thine eye to be opened to this house day and night, to the place which thou saidst to put thy name there, to hear to the prayer which thy servant shall pray to this place.
And hear to the supplications of thy servant, and thy people Israel, which they shall pray to this place: and thou wilt hear from the place of thy dwelling from the heavens; and thou heardest and forgave.
If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and he lifted up an oath upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath coming before thine altar in this house;
And wilt thou hear from the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, to turn back to the unjust to give his way upon his head: and to justify the just one by giving to him according to his justice.
And if thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy because they will sin against thee: and they turned back and confessed thy name, and prayed and made supplication before thee in this house;
And thou wilt hear from the heavens, and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
In shutting up the heavens and there was no rain, because they sinned against thee; if they prayed to this place, and confessed thy name, they shall turn back from their sin when thou wilt humble them.
And wilt thou hear from the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants, and thy people Israel? For thou wilt teach them to the good way which they shall go in it; and give rain upon the land which thou gavest to thy people for inheritance.
If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting and yellowness, the locust, and if there shall be the devourer; if the enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates; every stroke and every disease:
Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man, and to all thy people Israel, when each shall know his strobe and his griefs, and spreading forth his hands to this house;
And wilt thou hear from the heavens the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and give to each according to his ways, winch thou wilt know his heart? for thou alone knewest the heart of the sons of men.
So that they shall fear thee to walk in thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
And also to the stranger which he is not from thy people Israel, and coming from a land far off for sake of thy great name, and thy strong hand, and thine arm stretched out; and they came and prayed to this house;
And wilt thou hear from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call to thee? so that all thy people shall know that thy name was called upon this house that I built.
If thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way which thou shalt send them, and they prayed to thee the way of this city which thou didst choose in it, and the house that I built to thy name;
And hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and do their judgment.
If they shall sin against thee, (for no man which shall not sin) and thou wert angry with them, and gavest them before the face of the enemy, and they taking them captive carried them captive to a land afar off or near;
And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried away captive there, and they turned back and made supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned, we were perverse, and we did evil;
And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul into the land of their captivity where they carried them away captive; and they prayed the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city which thou <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as: </i></font><b> chosest</b><Rf>choosest, and to the house that I built for thy name.
And thou heardest from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications; and do their judgment, and forgive to thy people who sinned against thee.
Now, my God, shall thine eyes now be opened and thine ears attending to the prayer of this place.
And now arise, O Jehovah God, to thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy strength: thy priests, O Jehovah God, shall be clothed with salvation, and thy merciful ones shall rejoice in good.
O Jehovah God, thou wilt not turn away the face of thy Messiah: remember for the mercies of David thy servant.
And when Solomon finished to pray, and the fire will come down from the heavens and consume the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
And the priests were not able to come in to the house of Jehovah, for the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah.
And all the sons of Israel seeing in the fire coming down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, and they will bow down their faces to the earth upon the tesselated pavement, and they will worship and praise to Jehovah, for he is for his mercy is forever.
And the king and all the people sacrificed sacrifices before Jehovah.
And king Solomon will sacrifice a Sacrifice of oxen, twenty and two thousand; and sheep, a hundred and twenty thousand. And the king and all the people will consecrate the house of God.
And the priests standing over their watches: and the Levites with instruments of song of Jehovah which David the king made to praise to Jehovah, for forever his mercy in David's praising by their hand; and the priests trumpeting before them, and all Israel standing.
And Solomon will consecrate the midst of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah, for he did there the burnt-offerings and the fat of the peace, for the altar of brass which Solomon made was not able to contain the burnt-offering and the gift and the fat.
And Solomon will do the festival in this time seven days, and all Israel with him, a great convocation, from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt.
And they will do in the eighth day a restraint: for they did the consecration of the altar, seven days; and the festival, seven days.
And in the twenty and third to the seventh month he sent the people to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for the good that Jehovah did to David and to Solomon and to Israel his people.
And Solomon will finish the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king: and all coming upon the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Jehovah, and in his house, he prospered.
And Jehovah will be seen to Solomon in the night, and he will say to him, I heard thy prayer, and I chose in this place for me for a house of sacrifice.
If I shall shut up the heavens and there shall not be rain, and if I shall command upon the locust to consume the land, and if I shall send death upon my people;
And if my people which my name was called upon them shall be humbled and pray and seek my face, and turn back from their evil ways; and I will hear from the heavens and forgive to their sin, and I will heal their land.
Now shall mine eyes be opened, and mine ears attending to the prayer of this place.
And now I chose and I consecrated this house for my name to be there even to forever: and mine eyes and my heart were there all the days.
And thou, if thou wilt go before me as David thy father went, and to do according to all that I commanded thee, and my law and my judgment thou shalt watch:
And I set up the throne of thy kingdom according as I cut out to David thy father, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man ruling over Israel.
And if ye shall turn away and forsake my laws and my covenant which I gave before you, and ye went and served other gods and worshiped to them;
And I plucked them up from my land which I gave to them; and this house which I consecrated to my name I will cast from my face, and I will give it for a parable and for a derision among all peoples.
And this house which was high shall astonish to every one passing by it; and saying, For what did Jehovah thus to this land and to this house?
And they said, Because they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers who brought them forth from the land of Egypt; and they will lay hold upon other gods and worship to them, and serve them: for this he brought upon them all this evil.
And it will be from the end of twenty years, which Solomon built the house of Jehovah and his house,
And the cities which Huram gave to Solomon, Solomon built them, and he will cause the sons of Israel to dwell there.
And Solomon will go to Hamath-Zobah and he will lay hold upon it.
And he will build Tadmor in the desert, and all the cities of the stores which he built in Hamath.
And he will build the house of the hollow the high, and the house of the hollow the low, fortified cities, the walls, doors, and bar:
And Baalath and all the cities of the stores which were to Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon which he delighted to build in Jerusalem and Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
All the people being left from the Hittites and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which they were not from Israel,
From their sons who were left after them in the land which the sons of Israel consumed them not, and Solomon will bring them up for tribute even to this day.
And from the sons of Israel which Solomon gave not for servants for his work, for they the men of war and the chiefs of his thirds, and chiefs of his chariots and his horsemen.
And these the chiefs of the prefects which were to king Solomon, fifty and two hundred ruling over the people.
And the daughter of Pharaoh, Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house which he built for her: for he said, The wife to me shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for they are holiness which to them came the ark of Jehovah.
Then Solomon brought up burnt-offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of Jehovah which he built before the porch
And in the word of a day in a day to bring up according to the commands of Moses for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointments, three times in the year, in the festival of unleavened, in the festival of sevens, and in the festival of the tents.
And he will set up according to the judgment of David his father the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their watches, to praise and to serve before the priests for the word of a day in its day; and the gate-keepers in their divisions, to gate and gate: for thus the command of David the man of God.
And they departed not from the command of the king concerning the priests and the Levites for every word and for the treasures.
And all the work of Solomon will be prepared even to the day of the founding the house of Jehovah and even till its finishing. The house of Jehovah was completed.
Then Solomon went to Ezion-Geber and to Eloth upon the lip of the sea in the land of Edom.
And Huram will send to him by the hand of his servants, ships, and servants knowing the sea; and they will go with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and they will take from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and bring to king Solomon.
And the queen Sheba heard the hearing of Solomon, and she will come to try Solomon with enigmas in Jerusalem, with very weighty power, and camels lifting up spices, and gold, for multitude, and precious stone: and she will come to Solomon and speak with him all which was with her heart.
And Solomon will announce to her all her words, and not a word was hidden from Solomon which he announced not to her.
And the queen of Sheba will see the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,
And the food of his table, and the seat of his servants, and the standing of those waiting upon him, and their clothing, and his cup-bearers and their clothing, and his ascent that he went up to the house of Jehovah; and no more spirit was in her.
And she will say to the king, The word was truth which I heard in my land concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom:
And I believed not their words till when I came, and mine eyes will see: and behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not announced to me: thou didst add upon the hearing which I heard.
Happy thy men, and happy thy servants, these standing before thee always, and hearing thy wisdom.
Blessed shall be Jehovah thy God who delighted in thee to give thee upon his throne for king to Jehovah thy God: in thy God loving Israel to cause him to stand forever, and he will give thee for king over them to do judgment and justice.
And she will give to the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices for a multitude greatly, and precious stone: and there was not as that spice which queen Sheba gave to king Solomon.
And also the servants of Huram; and the servants of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir, brought almug trees and precious stone.
And the king will make the almug trees stair-cases to the house of Jehovah, and to the house of the king, and harps and lyres for those singing: and none were seen as they in the land of Judah.
And king Solomon gave to queen Sheba all her desire which she asked, besides what she brought to the king. And she will turn and go to her land, she and her servants.
And the weight of the gold that came to Solomon in one year will be six hundred and sixty six talents of gold;
Besides from men reconnoitering and those trafficking, bringing. And all the kings of Arabia and the prefects of the land bringing gold and silver to Solomon.
And king Solomon will make two hundred shields of beaten gold: six hundred of beaten gold he will bring up upon one shield.
And three hundred shields of beaten sold: three hundred of gold he will bring up upon one shield. And the king will give them into the house of the forest of Lebanon.
And the king will make a great throne of ivory, and he will overlay it with pure gold.
And six steps to the throne, and a footstool in gold holding fast to the throne, and hands from hence and from thence, upon the place of the seat, and two lions standing near the hands.
And twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, from hence and from thence. There was not made thus to any kingdom.
And all the vessels of drinking of king Solomon, gold; and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon, of shut up gold: no silver was reckoned in the days of Solomon for any thing.
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of huram: once to three years will come the ships to Tarshish, lifting up gold and silver and ivory, and apes and peacocks.
And king Solomon will be Magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom.

And the rest of the words of Solomon, the first and the last, are they not written upon the words of Nathan the prophet, and upon the prophesy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
And Solomon will reign in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son, will reign in his stead.
And Rehoboam will go to Shechem: for to Shechem came all Israel to make him king.
And it will be as Jeroboam son of Nebat heard, and he in Egypt where he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam will turn back from Egypt.
And they will send and call to him. And Jeroboam will come, and all Israel, and they will speak to Rehoboam, saying,
Thy father hardened our yoke: and now lighten from the hard servitude of thy father, and from his heavy yoke which he gave upon us, and we will serve thee.
And he will say to them, Yet three days and turn back to me. And the people will go.
And king Rehoboam will consult with the old men who were standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, How counsel ye me to turn back word to this people?
And they will speak to him, saying, If thou wilt be for good to this people, and pleasing them, and speak to them good words, and they were servants to thee all the days.
And he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled, and he will consult the children which grew up with him, standing before him.
And he will say to them, What counsel ye? and we will turn back word to this people who spake to me, saying, Lighten from the yoke which thy father gave upon us.
And the children which grew up with him will speak with him, saying, Thou shalt say thus to the people who spake to thee, saying, Thy father made heavy our yoke, and lighten thou from us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little finger thick above my father's loins.
And now my father loaded upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add upon your yoke: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.
And Jeroboam will come, and all the people, to Rehoboam, in the third day, as the king spake, saying, Turn back to me in the third day.
And the king will answer them hard; and king Rehoboam will forsake the counsel of the old men.
And he will speak to them according to the counsel of the children, saying, My father made heavy your yoke, and I will add upon it: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.
And the king heard not to the people, for the turn was of God, so that Jehovah raised up his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
And all Israel saw that the king heard not to them, and the people will turn back to the king, saying, What portion to us in David? And no inheritance in the son of Jesse: each to thy tents, O Israel: now see thy house, O David. And all Israel will go to his tents.
And the sons of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam will reign over them.
And king Rehoboam will send Hadoram who was over the tribute; and the sons of Israel will stone upon him, and he will die. And king Rehoboam strengthened himself to go up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
And Israel will break with the house of David even to this day.
And Rehoboam will come to Jerusalem, and he will convoke together the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen, making war to fight with Israel, to turn back the kingdom to Rehoboam.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Shemaiah a man of God, saying,
Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, and ye shall not war with your brethren: turn ye back each to his house: for from me was this word. And they will hear the words of Jehovah and turn back from going against Jeroboam.
And Rehoboam will dwell in Jerusalem, and he will build cities for fortification in Judah.
And he will build the house of bread, and the place of ravenous beasts, and the pitching of tents,
And the house of the rock, and the branches, and the justice of the people,
And the wine-press, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
And the two mounds, and Lachish, and Azekah,
And Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, cities of fortifications.
And he will strengthen the fortifications, and he will give in them leaders and treasures of food, and oil, and wine.
And in every city and city, shields and spears, and he will strengthen them very greatly, and there will be to him Judah and Benjamin.
And the priests and the Levites which were in all Israel stood forth to him from all their bound.
For the Levites forsook their areas and their possession, and they will come to Judah and to Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons rejected them from being priest to Jehovah:
And he will set up to him priests for the heights, for the wood-demons, and for the calves which he made.
And after them from all the tribes of Israel those giving their heart to seek Jehovah God of Israel came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And they will strengthen the kingdom of Judah, and make firm Rehoboam son of Solomon, for three years: for they went in the way of David and Solomon for three years.
And Rehoboam will take to him a wife, Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and Abihail daughter of Eliab son of Jesse;
And she will bear to him sons, Jeush and Shemariah, and Zaham.
And after her he took Maacah, daughter of Absalom; and she will bear to him Abijah and Attai, and Ziza and Shelomith.
And Rehoboam will love Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines; and he will beget twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.
And Rehoboam will set up for head, Abijah son of Maacah for leader over his brethren: in order to make him king.
And he will understand, and he will spread from all his sons to all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to all the cities of fortifications: and he will give to them food for multitude. And he will ask for a multitude of wives.
And it will be when Rehoboam established the kingdom, and when he strengthened himself, he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.
And it will be in the fifth year to king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, (for they transgressed against Jehovah,)
With a thousand and two hundred chariots, and with sixty thousand horsemen: and no number to the people that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, Sukkims, and the Cushites.
And he will take fortified cities which were to Judah and he will come even to Jerusalem.
And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and the chiefs of Judah who were gathered together to Jerusalem from the face of Shishak, and he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Ye forsook me, and I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
And the chiefs of Israel, and the king, will humble themselves; and they will say, Jehovah is just.
And in Jehovah's seeing that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah was to Shemaiah, saying, They humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, and I gave to them as a little for deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
For they shall be to him for servants; and they shall know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.
And Shishak king of Egypt will come up against Jerusalem, and will take the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the house of the king; he took the whole: and he will take the shields of gold that Solomon made.
And king Rehoboam will make instead of them, shields of brass, and he deposited upon the hand of the chiefs of the runners, those watching the entrance of the king's house.
And it will be as often as the king came into the house of Jehovah the runners came and lifted them up and turned them back to the chamber of the runners.
And in his humbling himself, the anger of Jehovah turned back from him, and not to destroy to the end: and also in Judah was good words.
And king Rehoboam will strengthen himself in Jerusalem, and he will reign: for the son of forty and one years was Rehoboam in his reigning, and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah chose to set his name there from all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother, Naamah the Ammonitess.
And he will do evil, for he prepared not his heart to seek Jehovah.
And the words of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and Iddo the seeing for the enrolling? And wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.
And Rehoboam will lie down with his fathers, and be buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son will reign in his stead.
And in the eighteenth year to king Jeroboam, Abijah will reign over Judah.
And three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother, Michaiah, daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And war was between Abijah and Jeroboam.
And Abijah will bind on the battle with the strength of the strong ones of war, four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam arranged the battle with him with eight hundred thousand, each chosen, strong of power.
And Abijah will rise up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and he will say, Hear me, Jeroboam, and all Israel;
Is it not to you to know that Jehovah God of Israel gave the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
And Jeroboam son of Nebat servant of Solomon son of David, will rise up and will rebel against his lord.
And vain men will gather together to him, sons of Belial; and they will strengthen themselves against Rehoboam son of Solomon; and Rehoboam being young and tender of heart, and he was not strong before them.
And now ye saying to be strengthened before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and ye a great multitude, and with you calves of gold which Jeroboam made for you for gods.
Did ye not thrust out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron and the Levites? and ye will make to you priests according to the peoples of the lands, every one coming to fill his hand with a bullock, son of the cow, and seven rams; and he was priest to no God.
And we, Jehovah is our God, and we forsook him not; and the priests serving to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in the work:
And burning to Jehovah the burnt-offering in the morning, in the morning, and in the evening, in the evening, and incense of spices, and the arrangement of bread upon the pure table; and the chandelier of gold and its lamps to burn in the evening, in the evening: for we watch the watches of Jehovah our God; and ye forsook him.
And behold, with us God for head, and his priests and trumpets of loud noise to cry against you. O ye sons of Israel, ye shall not wage war with Jehovah God of your fathers, for ye shall not prosper.
And Jeroboam turned about an ambush to come from behind them: and they will be before Judah, and the ambush from behind them.
And Judah will turn, and behold, to them the war before and behind: and they will cry out to Jehovah and the priests trumpeting with the trumpets.
And the men of Judah will shout: and it will be in the shouting of the men of Judah, and God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the sons of Israel will flee from the face of Judah: and God will give them into their hand.
And Abijah and his people will strike upon them a great blow: and there will fall wounded from Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
And the sons of Israel will be subdued in that time, and the sons of Judah will be strong, for they relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And Abijah will pursue after Jeroboam, and he will take cities from him, the house of God and its daughters, and Jeshanah and its daughters, and Ephraim and its daughters.
And Jeroboam retained no more strength in the days of Abijah: and Jehovah will smite him and he will die.
And Abijah will be strengthened, and he will take to him fourteen wives, and he will beget twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
And the rest of the words of Abijah, and his ways, and his words, being written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.
And Abijah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Asa his son will reign in his stead. In his days the land rested ten years.
And Asa will do the good and the straight in the eyes of Jehovah his God:
And he will remove the altars of the stranger, and the heights, and break the pillars, and cut down the images:
And he will say to Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commands.
And he will remove from all the cities of Judah the heights and the images: and the kingdom will rest before him.
And he will build cities of fortification in Judah: for the land rested, and not with him war in these years; for Jehovah gave rest to him.
And he will say to Judah, We will build these cities, and surround a wall, and towers, doors and bars, and the land yet before us: for we sought Jehovah our God, and he will give to us rest from round about And they will build and prosper.
And there will be to Asa an army lifting up the shield and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and from Benjamin lifting up the shield and bending the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these strong of power.
And there will come forth against them Zerah the Cushite with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he will come even to Mareshah.
And Asa will come forth before him, and they will arrange the battle in the valley of the watch-tower to Mareshah.
And Asa will call to Jehovah his God, and he will say, O Jehovah, nothing with thee to help between many to those of no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon thee we relied, and in thy name we came against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou our God; man shall not detain with thee.
And Jehovah will smite the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites will flee.
And Asa will pursue them, and the people which were with him, even to the lodging-place: and there will fall from the Cushites to nothing being to them, for they were broken before Jehovah, and before his camp; and they will lift up exceeding much spoil.
And they will strike all the cities round about the lodging-place; for the fear of Jehovah was upon them: and they will plunder all the cities; for much plunder was in them.
And also tents of cattle they struck, and they will turn back sheep for multitude, and camels; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
And Azariah son of Oded, upon him was the spirit of God.
And he will go forth before Asa, and say to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Jehovah is with you in your being with him; and if ye will seek him he will be found to you; and if ye will forsake him, he will forsake you.
And many days to Israel for not a God of truth, and for no priest teaching, and for no law.
And he will turn back in straits to him upon Jehovah God of Israel, and they will seek him and he will be found to them.
And in these times no peace to him going out, and to him coming in, for much consternation upon all inhabiting the lands.
And they dashed themselves, nation upon nation, and city upon city: for God disturbed them with all straits.
And ye, be ye strong, and your hands shall not be relaxed; for there is a reward to your work.
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he strengthened himself, and he will put away the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities which he took from mount Ephraim, and he will renew the altar of Jehovah which was before the porch of Jehovah.
And he will gather all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them from Ephraim and Manasseh and from Simeon: for they fell to him from Israel for multitude in their seeing that Jehovah his God was with him.
And they will gather together at Jerusalem in the third month, for the fifteenth year to the kingdom of Asa.
And they will sacrifice to Jehovah in that day from the spoil they brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
And they will come into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
And every one who will not seek for Jehovah God of Israel shall be put to death, from small and even to great, from man and even to woman.
And they will swear to Jehovah with a great voice, and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.
And all Judah will rejoice at the oath: for with all their heart they sware, and with all their desire they sought him, and he will be found to them: and Jehovah will give rest to them from round about.
And also Maachah, Asa's mother, the king removed her from queen because she made terror for a statue: and Asa will cut off her terror, and beat small, and burn in the torrent Kidron.
And the heights were not removed from Israel: but the heart of Asa was complete all his days.
And he will bring the holies of his father, and his holies, into the house of God, silver and gold and vessels.
And war was not even to the thirty and fifth year to the kingdom of Asa.
In the thirty and sixth year to the kingdom of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and he will build Ramah, not to give him coming out and going in to Asa, king of Judah.
And Asa will bring forth silver and gold from the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king, and he will send to the son of Hadad king of Aram, dwelling in Darmesek, saying,
A covenant between me and between thee, and between my father and between thy father: behold, I sent to thee silver and gold; go break thy covenant with Baasha king of Israel, and he will go up from me.
And the son of Hadad will hear to king Asa, and he will send chiefs of the armies which were with him against the cities of Israel; and they will strike Ijon and Dan and Abel-Maim, and all the stores of the cities of Naphtali.
And it will be when Baasha heard, and he will desist from building Ramah, and cause his works to cease.
And Asa the king took all Judah; and they will lift up the stones of Ramah, and its woods which Baasha built, and he will build with it Geba and Mizpeh.
And in that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and he will say to him, In thy relying upon the king of Aram, and thou didst not rely upon Jehovah thy God, for this the power of the king of Aram escaped from thy hand.
Were not the Cushites and the Lubims for an army for multitude, for chariots, and for horsemen to a great multitude? and in thy relying upon Jehovah he gave them into thy hand.
For Jehovah, his eyes run to and fro in all the earth to strengthen himself with the perfected heart of them to him. Thou wert foolish for this that from now there is wars with thee.
And Asa will be indignant to the seer, and he will give him to the house of the stocks, for he was in anger with him for this And Asa will oppress from the people in that time.
And behold, the words of Am, the first and the last, behold them written upon the book of the kings to Judah and to Israel.

And Asa will lie down with his fathers, and he will die in the year forty and one to his kingdom.
And they will bury him in his graves which he digged for himself in the city of David, and they will lay him down upon the bed which was filled with spices and sorts seasoned with aromatics of work. And they will burn for him a great burning, even to vehemence.
And Jehoshaphat his son will reign in his stead, and he will strengthen himself against Israel.
And he will give an army in all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will give garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father took.
And Jehovah will be with Jehoshaphat, for he went in the first ways of David his father, and he sought not for the Baals.
For to the God of his father he sought, and in his commands he went, and not according to the works of Israel.
And Jehovah will prepare the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah will give a gift to Jehoshaphat, and riches will be to him and honor for multitude.
And his heart will be high in the ways of Jehovah: and yet more, he removed the heights and statues from Judah.
And in the third year to his kingdom he sent to his chiefs to the son of power, and to the servant of Jehovah, and to him Remembered of Jehovah, and to the Gift of God, and to Who as God, to teach in the cities of Judah.

And the king of Israel will say to Jehoshaphat, Yet one man to seek Jehovah from him: and I hated him, for he prophesies not to me for good, but all his days for evil: he is Micaiah son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat will say, The king shall not say thus.
And the king of Israel will call for one eunuch, and say, Hasten Micaiah son of Imlah.
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sitting each upon his throne, being clothed in garments, and sitting in the area of the door of the gate of Shomeron: and all the prophets prophesying before them.

And the messenger who went to call for Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets with one mouth good to the king; and now will thy word be as one of them, and speak good.

And Jehovah will say, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel, and he shall go up and fall in Ramoth-Gilead? And this will say, saying, according to this, and this, saying according to this.
And a spirit will come forth and stand before Jehovah, and say, I will persuade. And Jehovah will say, In what?
And he will say, I will go forth and be for a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And he will say, Thou shalt persuade, and also thou shalt prevail: go and do thus.
And now behold Jehovah gave a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of these thy prophets, and Jehovah spake evil against thee.
And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, will draw near and strike Micaiah upon the cheek, and he will say, Which way passed the spirit of Jehovah from me to speak with thee?
And Micaiah will say, Behold thee seeing in that day which thou shalt go to a chamber in a chamber to hide thyself.

And they will rise early in the morning and go forth to the desert of Tekoa: and in their going forth Jehoshaphat stood, and he will say, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabiting Jerusalem; Believe in Jehovah your God and ye shall be firm; believe in his prophets and prosper.
And he will counsel to the people, and he will set up those singing to Jehovah, and those praising to the ornaments of holiness, in their going out before the strong, and saying, Confess ye to Jehovah; his mercy is forever.
And in the time they began in rejoicing and praising, Jehovah gave ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, coming against Judah; and they will be smitten.
For the sons of Ammon and Moab will stand up against those inhabiting mount Seir to utterly destroy and to cut off: and in their finishing upon those inhabiting Seir they helped each against his neighbor for destruction.
And Judah came upon the watchtower to the desert, and they will look towards the multitude, and behold them corpses falling to the earth, and none escaping.
And Jehoshaphat will come, and his people, to plunder their spoil, and they will find among them for multitude and possession, and corpses, and vessels of desires, and they will take away for themselves to not lifting up: and they will be three days plundering the spoil, for it was much.
And in the fourth day they were convoked together to the valley of praise; for there they praised Jehovah: for this, they called the name of that place, The valley of praise, even to this day.
And they will turn back every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat at their head, to turn back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah gladdened them from their enemies.
And they will come to Jerusalem with lyres and with harps and with trumpets to the house of Jehovah.
And the terror of God will be upon all the kingdoms of the lands in their hearing that Jehovah warred with the enemies of Israel.
And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat will rest: and God will give rest to him from round about.
And Jehoshaphat will reign over Judah: the son of thirty and five years in his reigning, and twenty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.
And he will go in the way of his father Asa, and he removed not from it, doing the straight in the eyes of Jehovah.
Only the heights were not removed: and yet the people prepared not their heart to the God of their fathers.
And the rest of the words of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, behold them written in the words of Jehu son of Hanani, who was made to go up upon the book of the kings of Israel.
And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, he being unjust to do.
And he will join himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they will make the ships in Ezion-Geber.
And Eliezer son of Dodavah of Mareshah will prophesy against Jehoshaphat, saying, In thy joining thyself with Ahaziab, Jehovah broke thy works And the ships will be broken, and be hindered to go to Tarshish.
And Jehoshaphat will lie down with his fathers, and be buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son will reign in his stead.
And to him brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
And their father will give to them many gifts to silver and to gold, and to precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: and he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the first-born.
And Jehoram will rise up over the kingdom of his father, and he will strengthen himself, and he will kill all his brethren with the sword, and also from the chiefs of Israel.
The son of thirty and two years was Jehoram in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
And he will go in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was to him for wife: and he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, for sake of the covenant which he cut out to David, and as he said to give to him a light and to his sons all the days.
In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they will cause a king to reign over them.
And Jehoram will pass over with his chiefs, and all the chariots with him: and he will be rising by night, and he will strike Edom surrounding to him, and the chiefs of the chariots.
And Edom will revolt from under the hand of Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah will revolt in that time from under his hand, for he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers.
Also he made heights in the mountains of Judah, and he will cause those inhabiting Jerusalem to commit fornication, and he will seduce Judah.
And a writing will come to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of David thy father, Because that thou didst not go in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, and in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
And thou wilt go in the way of the kings of Israel, and thou wilt cause Judah to commit fornication, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, according to the fornications of the house of Ahab, and also thou didst kill thy brethren of the house of thy father, being good above thee.
Behold, Jehovah smote a great stroke upon thy people, and upon thy sons, and upon thy wives, and upon all thy possessions:
And thou in great sicknesses in disease of thy bowels, till thy bowels shall come forth from the sickness days upon days.
And Jehovah will rouse up against Jehoram the spirit of the rovers and the Arabians which were upon the hand of the Cushitea.
And they will come up into Judah and rend it, and carry away captive all the possessions being found at the king's house, and also his sons and his wives; and there was not left to him a son except Jehoahaz the young of his sons.
And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with a sickness for no healing.
And it will be to days from days, and according to the time of the going forth of the end to the days the second time, his bowels will go forth with his sickness: and he will die with evil sicknesses. And his people made not to him a burning as the burning of his fathers.
The son of thirty and two was he in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he will go without desire: and they will bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings.
And they inhabiting Jerusalem will make Ahaziah his young son king in his stead: for a troop coming with the Arabians to the camp killed all the first. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah will reign.
The son of forty and two years was Ahaziah in his reigning, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Athaliah, daughter of Omri.
Also he went in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was counseling him to do evil.
And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah as the house of Ahab: for they were were counseling to him after the death of his father, for destruction to him.
Also he went in their counsel, and he will go with Jehoram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael, king of Aram in Ramoth-Gilead: and the Syrians will strike Joram.
And he will turn back to be healed in Jezreel because of the blows which they struck him in Ramoth in his warring with Hazael king of Aram. And Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah will go down to see Jehoram son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
And from God was the destruction of Ahaziah, for coming to Joram: and in his coming he went forth with Jehoram against Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah anointed him to cut off the house of Ahab.
And it will be according to the judging of Jehu with the house of Ahab, and he will find the chiefs of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah serving to Ahaziah, and he will kill them.
And he will seek Ahaziah, and they will take him, (and he being hid in Shomeron) and they will bring him to Jeku: and they will put him to death and bury him: For, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And not to the house of Ahaziah to retain strength to the kingdom.
And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son died, and she will rise up and destroy all the seed of the kingdom to the house of Judah.
And Jehoshabeath daughter of the king will take Joash son of Ahaziah, and she will steal him from the midst of the king's sons being slain, and give him and his nurse in a bed-chamber. And Jehoshabeath daughter of king Jehoram wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was sister of Ahaziah) will hide him from the face of Athaliah, and she slew him not.
And he will be with them in the house of God being hid six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and he will take chiefs of hundreds to Azariah son of Jeroham, and to Ishmael son of Jehohanan, and to Azariah son of Obed, and with Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and with Elishaphat son of Zichri, with him in covenant.
And they will go about in Judah and gather the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers to Israel, and they will come to Jerusalem.
And all the convocation will cut out a covenant in the house of God with the king. And he will say to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah spake concerning the sons of David.
This the word which ye shall do; the third of you coming in the Sabbath to the priests and to the Levites, to the gates of the thresholds;
And the third in the king's house; and the third in the gate of the foundation: and all the people in the enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
And they shall not come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those serving to the Levites; they shall come in for they are holy: and all the people shall watch the watches of Jehovah.
And the Levites surrounded the king round about, a man and his utensil in his hand; and he coming to the house shall be put to death: and be ye with the king in his coming in, and in his going out.
And the Levites and all Judah will do according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded, and they will take each his men coming in on the Sabbath, with those coming out on the Sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the divisions.
And Jehoiada the priest will give to the chiefs of hundreds, spears and shields and bucklers, which were to king David, which were in the house of God.
And he will cause all the people to stand, and each his missile weapon in his hand, from the right shoulder of the house even to the left shoulder of the house, to the altar and to the house by the king round about.
And they will bring forth the king's son, and they will give the diadem upon him, and the testimonies, and they will make him king. And Jehoiada and his sons will anoint him, and say, The king shall live.
And Athaliah will hear the voice of the people running and praising the king, and she will come to the people in the house of Jehovah.
And she will see, and behold, the king standing upon his standing in the coming in, and the chiefs and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoicing, and they clanged upon the trumpets; and those singing with instruments of the song, and those knowing to praise. And Athaliah will rend her garments and say, A conspiracy! a conspiracy!
And Jehoiada the priest will bring forth the chiefs of hundreds reviewing the army, and he will say to them, Bring her forth from the house of the ranks: and he coming after her shall be slain with the sword: for the priest said, Ye shall not slay her in the house of Jehovah.
And they will put hands upon her, and she will come to the entrance of the gate of horses of the king's house; and they will slay her there.
And Jehoiada will cutout a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, to be for a people to Jehovah.
And all the people will come to the house of Baal, and they will pull it down, and they broke his altars and his images, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
And Jeboiada will set the oversight of the house of Jehovah in the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David distributed over the house of Jehovah, to bring up the burnt-offerings of Jehovah, as was written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with song, by the hands of David.
And he will cause the gate-keepers to stand at the gates of the house of Jehovah, and the unclean shall not come in to all the word.
And he will take the chiefs of hundreds, and the powerful, and those ruling over the people, and all the people of the land, and he will bring down the king from the house of Jehovah: and they will come in the midst of the highest gate of the king's house: and they will set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
And all the people of the land will rejoice: and the city rested; and they killed Athaliah with the sword.
The son of seven years was Joash in his reigning, and forty years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Zibeah from the Well of the Oath.
And Joash will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
And Jehoiada will take to him two wives; and he will beget sons and daughters.
And it will be after this it was with the heart of Joash to renew the house of Jehovah.
And he will gather together the priests and the Levites, and say to them, Go ye forth to the cities of Judah and gather together from all Israel silver to strengthen the house of your God as often as year by year, and ye shall hasten to the word. And the Levites hastened not.
And the king will call for Jehoiada the head, and say to him, Wherefore didst thou not seek out for the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the loan of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the convocation to Israel, to the tent of testimonies?
For Athaliah doing evil; her sons broke asunder the house of God; and also all the holies of the house of Jehovah they made for the Baals.
And the king will say, and they will make one ark, and they will give it in the gate of the house of Jehovah without.
And they will give a voice in Judah and in Jerusalem, to bring in to Jehovah the loan of Moses the servant of God, upon Israel in the desert.
And the chiefs and all the people will rejoice, and they will bring in and cast into the ark, even to finishing.
And it will be in the time of bringing in the ark to the charge of the king by the hand of the Levites, and in their seeing that there was much silver, and the king's scribe came, and the head priest's overseer, and they will empty the ark and lift it up, and turn it back to its place. Thus they did to day by day, and they will gather silver for multitude.
And the king and Jehoiada will give for doing the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and hewers and artificers will be hired to renew the house of Jehovah, and also for those working iron and brass to strengthen the house of Jehovah.
And they doing the work will work, and healing will go up to the work by their hand, and they will cause the house of God to stand upon its measure, and they will make it firm.
And in their finishing they brought before the king and Jehoiada the rest of the silver, and they will make vessels for the house of Jehovah, vessels to serve and to bring up, and dishes, and vessels of gold and silver. And they will be bringing up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah always all the days of Jehoiada.
And Jehoiada will be old and full of days, and he will die the son of a hundred and thirty years in his death.
And they will bury him in the city of David with the kings, for he did good in Israel, and with God and his house.
And after the death of Jehoiada came the chiefs of Judah, and they will Worship to the king. Then the king heard to them.
And they will forsake the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and they will serve the statues and the images: and wrath will be upon Judah and Jerusalem in this their trespass.
And he will send prophets among them to turn them back to Jehovah; and they will testify against them: and they gave not ear.
And the spirit of God clothed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest, and he will stand from above to the people, and say to them, Thus said God, Wherefore are ye passing by the commands of Jehovah, and ye shall not prosper? for ye forsook Jehovah, and he will forsake you.
And they will conspire against him, and stone him with stone by the commands of the king in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah.
And Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father did with him, and he will kill his son. And in his death he said, Jehovah will see and seek out.
And it will be at the circuit of the year, the power of Aram came up against him: and they will come to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroy all the chiefs of the people from the people, and all their spoil they sent to the king of Darmesek.
For with a smallness of men came the army of Aram, and Jehovah gave into their hand an army to a great multitude, for they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers. And they did judgment with Joash.
And in their going away from him (for they forsook him in many diseases) his servants conspired against him for the bloods of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and they will kill him upon his bed, and he will die: and they will bury him in the city of David, and they buried him not in the graves of the kings.
And these they conspiring against him: Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
And his sons and the multitude of the lifting up upon him, and the founding of the house of God, behold them written upon the commentary of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twenty and five years reigned Amaziah, and twenty and nine years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jehoaddan from Jerusalem.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, only not with a whole heart.
And it will be when the kingdom was strengthened over him, and he will slay his servants striking the king his father.
And their sons he slew not, for as written in the law in the book of Moses where Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers, for each shall die in his sin.
And Amaziah will gather Judah together, and set them up for the house of the fathers for chiefs of thousands, and for chiefs of hundreds, to all Judah and Benjamin: and he will review them from the son of twenty years and above, and he will find them three hundred thousand chosen going forth to war, holding spear and shield.
And he will hire from Israel a hundred thousand strong of power, with a hundred talents of silver.
And a man of God came to him, saying, O king, the army of Israel shall not go with thee; for Jehovah is not with Israel all the sons of Ephraim.
For if thou goest, to be strong for war: God will cause thee to falter before the enemy, for there is power with God to help and to cause to falter.
And Amaziah will say to the man of God, And what to do for the hundred talents of silver which I gave to the troop of Israel? And the man of God will say, There is to Jehovah to give to thee much above this.
And Amaziah will separate them for the troop which came to him from Ephraim to go to their place: and their anger will kindle greatly against Judah, and they will turn back to their place in the heat of anger.
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and he will lead out his people, and go to the valley of salt, and he will strike the sons of Seir, ten thousand.
And ten thousand living the sons of Judah carried away captive, and they will bring them to the head of the rock, and they will cast them down from the head of the rock, and they were rent asunder all of them.
And the sons of the troop which Amaziah turned back from going with him to war, and they will invade upon the cities of Judah from Shomeron and even to the house of the hollow, and he will strike of them three thousand, and they will plunder much plunder.
And it will be after Amaziah came from the smiting of the Edomites, and he will bring the gods of the sons of Seir, and he will set them up to him for gods, and worship before them, and burn incense to them.
And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against Amaziah, and he will send to him a prophet, and he will say to him, Wherefore soughtest thou the gods of the people who delivered not their people from thy hand?
And it will be in his speaking to him, and he will say to him, Did they give thee for counselor to the king? Desist; for thyself, wherefore shall they strike thee? And the prophet will desist, and say, I knew that God counseled to destroy thee, for thou didst this, and thou heardest not to my counsel.
And Amaziah king of Judah will take counsel, and will send to Joash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, we will see faces.
And Joash king of Israel will send to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thorn-bush which was in Lebanon sent to the cedar which was in Lebanon, saying, Thou shalt give thy daughter to my son for wife: and a beast of the field that was in Lebanon will pass by and tread down the thorn-bush.
Thou saidst, Behold, thou didst strike Edom; and thy heart lifted thee up to boast: now dwell in thy house; wherefore wilt thou be stirred up in evil, and thou fallest, and Judah with thee?
And Amaziah heard not; for it was from God, so that he will give them into the hand, for they sought the gods of Edom.
And Joash king of Israel will go up; and they will see faces, he and Amaziah king of Judah, in the house of the sun which was to Judah.
And Judah will be smitten before Israel, and they will flee a man to his tent.
And Joash king of Israel seized Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, in the house of the sun; and he will bring him to Jerusalem, and he will break in upon the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim, even to the gate of turning, four hundred cubits.
And all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels being found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the sons of suretyship, and he will turn back to Shomeron.
And Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah will live after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
And the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
And from the time that Amaziah turned away from Jehovah and they will conspire against him a conspiracy in Jerusalem; and he will flee to Lachish: and they will send after him to Lachish, and they will kill him there.
And they will lift him up upon horses, and bury him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
And all the people will take Uzziah, and he the son of sixteen years, and they will make him king instead of his father Amaziah.
He built Eloth and turned it back to Judah; afterwards the king lay down with his fathers.
The son of sixteen years was Uzziah in his reigning, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jecoliah from Jerusalem.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which Amaziah his father did.
And he will be for seeking God in the days of Zechariah understanding in the visions of God: and in the days of his seeking Jehovah, God prospered him.
And he will go forth and war against the rovers, and he will break in the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he will build cities in Ashdod, and among the rovers.
And God will help him against the rovers, and against the Arabians inhabiting Gur-Baal, and the Mehunims.
And the Ammonites will give a gift to Uzziah: and his name will go even to the entrance of Egypt: for he was strengthened even to above.
And Uzziah will build towers in Jerusalem at the gate of the corner, and at the gate of the valley, and at the angle, and he will strengthen them.
And he will build towers in the desert, and hew out many wells: for there were many cattle to him; and in the low country and in the plain; and husbandmen and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was loving the earth.
And there will be to Uzziah an army making war, going forth to war to a troop in the number of their reviewing by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the leader, upon the hand of Hananiah from the kings chiefs.
All the number of the heads of the fathers to the strong ones of power, two thousand and six hundred.
And upon their hand the power of an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, making war with the strength of power to help to the king against the enemy.
And Uzziah will prepare for them for all the army shields and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and for stones of slings.
And he will make in Jerusalem engines, devised of him devising, to be upon the towers and upon the corners to cast with arrows and with great stones. And his name went forth even to afar off; for he was made wonderful to help even till he was strong.
And in his being strong his heart was lifted up even to destruction: for he will transgress against Jehovah his God, and come in to the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
And Azariah the priest will go in after him, and with him eighty priests to Jehovah, sons of strength.
And they will stand against Uzziah the king, and say to him, Not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, being consecrated to burn incense: go forth from the holy place, for thou didst trespass; and not to thee for honor from Jehovah God.
And Uzziah will he angry, and in his hand a censer to burn incense: and in his being angry with the priests, the leprosy rose in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah, from above to the altar of incense.
And Azariah the head priest will turn to him, and all the priests, and behold, he was smitten in his forehead, and they will drive him out from thence; and he also hastened to go forth, for Jehovah struck him.
And Uzziah the king will be smitten even to the day of his death; and he dwelt in a house of infirmity, leprous; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah: and Jotham his son over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
And the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, wrote Isaiah son of Amos the prophet.
And Uzziah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him with his fathers in the field of the burial which was to the kings; for they said, He is leprous: and Jotham his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twenty and five years was Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which Uzziah his father did: only he came not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people yet being corrupted.

And he built cities in the mountain of Judah, and in the thickets he built fortresses and towers.
And he waged war with the king of the sons of Ammon, and he will be strong against them. And the sons of Ammon will give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and barley ten thousand. This the sons of Ammon turned back to him, in the second year, and the third.
And Jotham will be strengthened, for he prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
And the rest of the words of Jotham, and all his works and his ways, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
The son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem.
And Jotham will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twenty years was Ahaz in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem: and he did not the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to David his father.
And he will go in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also molten images made he to the Baals.
And he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and he will burn his sons in fire according to the abomination of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.
And he will sacrifice and burn incense in the heights, and upon the hills, and under every green tree.
And Jehovah his God will give him into the hand of the king of Aram; and they will strike upon him, and they will make captives from them a great captivity, and bring to Darmesek. And also he was given into the hand of the king of Israel, and he will strike upon him a great blow.
And Pekah son of Remaliah will kill in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, the whole sons of strength; in their forsaking Jehovah the God of their fathers.

And the sons of Israel will make captive from their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons and daughters, and also much spoil they plundered from them, and they will bring the spoil to Shomeron.
And a prophet to Jehovah was there, Oded his name: and he will go forth before the army coming to Shomeron, and say to them, Behold, in the anger of Jehovah the God of your fathers upon Judah he gave them into your hand, and ye will slay among them in wrath reaching even to the heavens.
And now ye are saying to subdue the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for servants and for maids to you: are not only with you trespasses with you against Jehovah your God?
And now hear me and turn back the captivity that ye took captive from your brethren: for the burning of the anger of Jehovah is upon you.
And there will arise up men from the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah son of Johanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai, against those coming from the war,
And they will say to them, Ye shall not bring the captivity here; because for trespass Jehovah is against us, ye saying to add to our sins and to our trespass: for great the trespass to us, and the burning of anger against Israel.
And the armed will leave the captivity and the plunder before the chiefs and all the convocation.
And men who were distinguished by names will rise up and will lay hold upon the captivity, and all their naked they clothed from the spoil, and they will clothe them, and shoe them, and feed them, and give them to drink, and anoint them, and conduct them upon asses for all being weak, and bring them to Jericho the city of palm trees, near their brethren: and they will turn back to Shomeron.
In that time king Ahaz sent for the kings of Assur for help to him.
And yet the Edomites came and they will strike in Judah, and take captive a captivity.
And the rovers invaded upon the cities of the low country, and the south to Judah, and they will take the house of the sun, and the oak, and the walls, and the branches and her daughters, and the portion assigned and her daughters, and Gimzo and her daughters: and they will dwell there.
For Jehovah humbled Judah on account of Ahaz king of Israel: for he was unbridled upon Judah, and transgressing, he transgressed against Jehovah.
And Tilgath-Pileser king of Assur, will come to him and he will press upon him, and he strengthened him not.
For Ahaz divided out the house of Jehovah, and the king's house, and the chiefs, and he will give to the king of Assur: and not for help to him.
And in the time of straits to him and he will add to transgress against Jehovah: this the king Ahaz.
And he will sacrifice to the gods of Darmesek smiting upon him: and he will say, Because the gods of the kings of Aram they help them, to them will I sacrifice, and they will help me. And they were to him for stumbling, and to all Israel.
And Ahaz will gather together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he will make to him altars in every corner in Jerusalem.
And in every city and city to Judah he made heights to burn incense to other gods, and he will irritate Jehovah the God of his fathers.
And the rest of his words and all his ways, the first and the last, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
And Ahaz will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city in Jerusalem: but they brought him not to the graves of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son will reign in his stead.
And Hezekiah reigned the son of twenty and five years, and twenty and nine years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Abiah, daughter of Zechariah.
And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah according to all which David his father did.
He, in the first year to his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and he will strengthen them.
And he will bring in the priests and the Levites, and he will gather them together to the street of the sunrising,
And he will say to them, Hear me, ye Levites: now consecrate yourselves and consecrate the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and bring forth the uncleanness from the holy place.
For our fathers trespassed and did evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God, and they will forsake and turn away their faces from the dwelling of Jehovah, and they will give the neck.
Also they shut up the doors of the porch, and they will put out the lights, and they burnt not incense, and they brought not up the burnt-offering in the holy place to the God of Israel.
And the wrath of Jehovah will be upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he will give them to disquiet, to astonishment, and to hissing, according to what ye see with your eyes.
And behold, our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives in captivity for this.
Now with my heart to cut out a covenant to Jehovah the God of Israel, and he will turn back from us the burning of his anger.
My sons, now ye shall not go astray: for in you Jehovah chose to stand before him, to serve him, to be serving to him, and burning incense.
And the Levites will rise up, Mahath son of Amasai, and Joel son of Azariah, from the sons of the Kohathites: and from the sons of the Merarites: Kish, son of Abdi, and Azariah, son of Jehalelel: and from the Gershonites: Joah, son of Zimmah, and Eden, son of Joah:
And from the sons of Elizaphan: Shimri and Jeiel: and from the sons of Asaph: Zechariah and Mattaniah:
And from the sons of Heman: Jehiel and Shimei: and from the sons of Jeduthun: Shemaiah and Uzziel.
And they will gather their brethren, and they will consecrate themselves, and they will come according to the command of the king in the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
And the priests will come to within the house of Jehovah to cleanse, and they will bring forth all the uncleanness which they found in the temple of Jehovah to the enclosure of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites will take to bring forth to the torrent Kidron without.
And they will begin in one to the first month to consecrate, and in the eighth day to the month they came to the porch of Jehovah: and they will consecrate the house of Jehovah for eight days; and in the sixteenth day to the first month they finished.
And they will come within to Hezekiah the king, and say, We cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and the table of the arrangement and all its vessels.
And all the vessels which king Ahaz cast away in his kingdom, in his transgression, we prepared and consecrated, and behold them before the altar of Jehovah.
And Hezekiah the king will rise early and gather the chiefs of the city, and he will go up to the house of Jehovah.
And they will bring seven bullocks and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats of the goats for sin, for the kingdom, and for the holy place, and for Judah. And he will say to the sons of Aaron the priests to bring up upon the altar of Jehovah.
And they will slaughter the oxen, and the priests will take the blood and sprinkle the altar: and they will slaughter the rams, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar: and they will slaughter the lambs and sprinkle the blood upon the altar.
And they will bring near the he goats of the sin before the king and the convocation; and they will lay their hands upon them.
And the priest will slaughter them, and expiate the altar with their blood, to expiate for all Israel: for to all Israel the king said to bring up the sin.
And he will set up the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lyres and with harps by the command of David, and Gad, the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for by the hand of Jehovah the command by the hand of his prophets.
And the Levites will stand with all the instruments of David, and the priests with trumpets.
And Hezekiah will say to bring up the burnt-offering to the altar. And in the time of beginning to bring up, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, and upon the hands of the instruments of David king of Israel.
And all the convocation worshiping, and the song singing, and the trumpets trumpeting: the whole even to finishing the burnt-offering.
And as they finished to bring up, the king and all being found with him, bowed and worshiped.
And Hezekiah the king, and the chiefs, will say, to the Levites to praise to Jehovah in the words of David, and Asaph the seer. And they will praise even to gladness, and they will bow down and worship.
And Hezekiah will answer and say, Now ye filled your hand to Jehovah, draw near and bring sacrifices and praises to the house of Jehovah. And the convocation will bring sacrifices and praises; and all of a willing heart, burnt-offerings.
And the number of the burnt-offerings which the convocation brought, will be seventy oxen, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these for a bunt-offering to Jehovah.
And the consecrated things, six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
Only the priests were for fewness and they could not slaughter all the burnt-offerings: and their brethren the Levites will strengthen them till the finishing of the work, and till the priests shall consecrate themselves: for the Levites being upright of heart to consecrate themselves more than the priests.
And also the burnt-offering for multitude, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the libations for the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of Jehovah will be prepared.
And Hezekiah will rejoice, and all the people, for God prepared for the people: for the word was in suddenness.
And Hezekiah will send to all Israel and Judah, and also he wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to do the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel.
And the king will take counsel, and his chiefs, and all the convocation in Jerusalem, to do the passover in the second month.
For they could not do it at that time for the priests consecrated not themselves sufficiently, and the people were not gathered to Jerusalem.
And the word will be straight in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the convocation.
And they will set up a word to cause a voice to pass in all Israel, from the well of the oath, and even to judgment, to come to do the passover to Jehovah God of Israel in Jerusalem: for they did not for much time as written.
And the runners will go with the letters from the hand of the king and his chiefs in all Israel and Judah, and according to the command of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, turn back to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaak and Israel, and he will turn back to the escaping being left to you from the hand of the king of Assur.
And ye shall not be as your fathers and as your brethren who trespassed against Jehovah the God of their fathers, and he will give them to desolation according to what ye see.
Now ye shall not harden your neck as your fathers; ye shall give the hand to Jehovah, and come ye into his holy place which he consecrated forever: and serve ye Jehovah your God, and he will turn back from you the burning of his anger.
For in your turning back to Jehovah, your brethren and your sons are for compassions before them making them captive, to turn back to this land: for Jehovah your God being merciful and compassionate, and he will not turn away his face from you if ye shall turn back to him.
And the runners will be passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and even to Zebulon: and laughing upon them, and deriding over them.
But men from Asher and Manasseh, and from Zebulon, were humbled, and they will come to Jerusalem.
Also in Judah was the hand of God to give to them one heart to do the commands of the king and the chiefs by the word of Jehovah.
And there will gather together many people at Jerusalem to do the festival of the unleavened in the second month, a convocation for exceeding greatness.
And they will rise and take away the altars which were in Jerusalem, and the censers they removed, and they will cast to the torrent Kidron.
They will slaughter the passover in the fourteenth to the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they will consecrate themselves and bring burnt-offerings to the house of Jehovah.
And they will stand upon their standing according to their judgment, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkling the bloods from the hand of the Levites.
For many in the convocation which consecrated not themselves: and the Levites for slaughtering the passover to all not being cleansed to consecrate to Jehovah.
For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulon, were not cleansed, for they ate the Passover not as written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, Jehovah the good will expiate in behalf.
Of every one preparing his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, and not according to the purification of the holy place.
And Jehovah will hear to Hezekiah and he will heal the people.
And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, will do the festival of the unleavened seven days, in great gladness: and the priests and the Levites praising to Jehovah day by day with instruments of strength to Jehovah.
And Hezekiah will speak to the heart of all the Levites considering the good knowledge to Jehovah: and they will eat at the appointment seven days, sacrificing sacrifices of peace, and confessing to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And all the convocation will take counsel to do other seven days: and they will do seven days with gladness.
For Hezekiah king of Judah lifted up to the convocation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the chiefs lifted up to the convocation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and the priests will consecrate themselves to a multitude.
And all the convocation of Judah will rejoice, and the priests and the Levites, and all the convocation coming from Israel, and the strangers coming from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.
And there will be great gladness in Jerusalem: for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there was not as this in Jerusalem.
And the priests the Levites will rise up and bless the people: and he will hear to their voice, and their prayer will come to the dwelling of his holy place to the heavens.
And as all this was finished, all Israel being found will go forth to the cities of Judah, and they will break the images and cut off the statues and tear down the heights, and the altars of all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh even to finishing. And all the sons of Israel will turn back each to his possession to their cities.
And Hezekiah will set up the divisions of the priests and the Levites for their divisions each according to the mouth of his service to the priests and to the Levites for the burnt-offering and for the peace, to serve and to confess and to praise, in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
And the portion of the king from his possessions for the burnt-offerings, for the burnt-offerings of the morning and the evening, and the burnt-offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointments according as written in the law of Jehovah.
And he will say to the people, to those inhabiting Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and the Levites so that they shall be strengthened in the law of Jehovah.
And when the word broke forth, the sons of Israel increased the first-fruits of the grain, the new wine and the new oil, and honey, and all the produce of the field; and the tenth of all they brought in for abundance.
And the sons of Israel and Judah dwelling in the cities of Judah, also they brought in the tenth of oxen and sheep, and the tenth of the holies being consecrated to Jehovah their God, and they will give heaps, heaps.
In the third month the heaps began to be founded, and in the seventh month they were finished.
And Hezekiah and the chiefs will come and see the heaps, and they will praise Jehovah and his people of Israel.
And Hezekiah will seek to the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
And Azariah the head priest for the house of Zadok will say to him and he will say, From the beginning to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, eating and being filled, and leaving even to abundance: for Jehovah blessed his people; and that being left this multitude.
And Hezekiah will say to prepare cells in the house of Jehovah; and they will prepare,
And they will bring in the oblations and the tenth, and the holies, with faithfulness: and over them the leader Cononiah the Levite, and Shimei his brother, the second.
And Jehiel and Azaziah and Nahath and Asahel and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, reviewing from the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah leader of the house of God.
And Kore, son of Imnah the Levite, the gate-keeper to the sunrising over the voluntaries of God, to give the oblations of Jehovah, and the holies of holies.
And upon his hand Eden and Miniamin, and Joshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, with faithfulness,-to give to their brethren by divisions according to the great, according to the small:
Besides their enrolling to males from the son of three years and above, to all coming to the house of Jehovah, for the word of a day in its day for their service in their watches according to their divisions.
And the enrolling of the priests for the house of their fathers, and the Levites from the son of twenty years and above, in their watches, by their divisions:
And to the enrolling upon all their little ones, their wives and their sons, and their daughters, for all the convocation: for in their faithfulness they will consecrate themselves holy:
And to the sons of Aaron the priests in the fields of the area of their cities, in every city and city, the men who were distinguished by names to give gifts to every male among the priests, and to all the enrolling among the Levites.
And according to this Hezekiah will do in all Judah, and he will do the good and the straight and the truth before Jehovah his God.
And in all the work which he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and in the command to seek to his God, with all his heart he did, and prospered.
After these words and the truth, came Senherib king of Assur, and he will come into Judah, and will encamp against the fortified cities, and say to divide them for himself.
And Hezekiah will see that Senherib came, and his face for war against Jerusalem.
And he will take counsel with his chiefs and his strong ones to stop the waters of the fountains which were without to the city: and they will help him.
And much people will be gathered together, and they will stop all the fountains, and the torrent gushing through the midst of the land, saving, Wherefore shall the kings of Assur come and find many waters?
And he will strengthen himself and build all the wall broken down, and he will go up upon the towers, and to without another wall, and he will strengthen the filling up of the city of David, and he will make darts for abundance, and shields.
And he will give chiefs of the war over the people, and he will gather them together to him to the street of the gate of the city, and he will speak to their heart, saying,
Be strong and be firm ye shall not fear and ye shall not be terrified-from the face of the king of Assur, and from before all the multitude which are with him: for with us much more than with him.
With him an arm of flesh; and with us Jehovah our God to help, and to war our wars. And the people will lean upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
After this Senherib king of Assur sent his servants to Jerusalem (and he at Lachish, and all his dominion with him) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah which were in Jerusalem, saying,
Thus said Senherib king of Assur, Upon what are ye trusting, and dwelling in the fortress in Jerusalem?
Is not Hezekiah stimulating you to give yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assur?
Did not this Hezekiah remove his heights, and his altars? and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar shall ye worship and upon it shall ye burn incense?
Will ye not know what I did, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the lands? Being able, were the gods of the nations of the lands able to deliver their land from my hand?
Who from all the gods of these nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, which were able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God shall be able to deliver you from my hand?
And now Hezekiah shall not deceive you, and he shall not stimulate you according to this, and ye shall not believe upon him: for not any God of any nation and kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my father: much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand.
And yet spake his servants against Jehovah God, and against Hezekiah his servant.
And he wrote letters to reproach to Jehovah God of Israel, and to say against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands who delivered not their people from my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people from my hand.
And they will call with a great voice in Judaic to the people of Jerusalem which were upon the wall, to cause them to fear and to terrify them, so that they shall take the city.
And they will speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of the hand of man.
And Hezekiah the king will pray, and Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, for this, and they will cry to the heavens.
And Jehovah will send a messenger, and he will cut off every strong one of power, and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assur. And he will turn back with shame of face to his land. And he will come into the house of his God, and they coming forth from his bowels caused him to fall there by the sword.
And Jehovah will save Hezekiah, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, from the hand of Senherib king of Assur, and from the hand of all, and protect them from round about.
And many bringing a gift to Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah: and he will be lifted up to the eyes of all the nations from after this.
In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he will pray to Jehovah: and he will say to him, and be gave to him a sign.
And not according to the doing to him did Hezekiah turn back, for his heart was lifted up: and there will be wrath upon him, and upon Judah and upon Jerusalem.
And Hezekiah will humble himself for the lifting up of his heart, he and those inhabiting Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
And there will be to Hezekiah riches and honor exceedingly much: and he made to him treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stone, and for spices and for shields, and for all vessels of desire:
And stores for produce of grain and new wine, and new oil, and stalls for all cattle, and cattle and flocks for the stalls.
And he made cities to him and possession of flocks and oxen for abundance: for God gave to him exceeding much substance.
And this Hezekiah stopped the going forth of the waters of Gihon the highest, and he will make them straight down from the west to the city of David. And Hezekiah will prosper in all his work.
Thus in the chiefs of Babel interceding, sending to him to seek out the sign which was in the land, God left him, to try him, to know all in his heart.
And the rest of the words of Hezekiah and his mercies, behold them written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the ascent of the graves of the sons of David: and all Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem did honor to him in his death: and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twelve years was Manasseh in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem.
And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from before the sons of Israel.
And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father pulled down; and he will raise up altars for the Baals, and he will make statues, and worship to all the army of the heavens, and he will serve them.
And he built altars in the house of Jehovah, which Jehovah said, In Jerusalem shall be my name forever.
And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.
And he caused his sons to pass through in fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: and he practiced magic and used divination, and offered prayers, and made sorcerers and wizards: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate him.
And he will set up a carved image, the likeness which he made in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever.
And I will not add to remove the foot of Israel from the land which I set to your fathers; only if they will watch to do all I commanded them, for all the law and the precepts and the judgments by the hand of Moses.
And Manasseh will cause Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem to wander, to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from before the sons of Israel.
And Jehovah will speak to Manasseh, and to his people, and they attended not.
And Jehovah will bring upon them the chiefs of the army which were to the king of Assur, and they will take Manasseh with hooks, and they will bind him with fetters and cause him to go to Babel.
And when straits were to him he besought the face of Jehovah his God, and he will humble himself greatly from before the God of his fathers.
And he will pray to him, and he will be entreated for him, and he will hear his supplication, and he will turn him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Jehovah he is God.
And after this he built a wall outside to the city of David from the west to Gihon, in the valley to the entering into the gate of fishes, and it turned round about to the hill, and he will lift it up greatly, and he will set chiefs of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
And he will remove the strange gods and the likeness from the house of Jehovah, and all the altars which he built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah, and in Jerusalem, and he will cast without to the city.
And he will build the altar of Jehovah, and he will sacrifice upon it sacrifices of peace and praise, and he will say to Judah serve Jehovah the God of Israel.
But the people yet are sacrificing in the height, only to Jehovah their God.
And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers speaking to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold them upon the words of the kings of Israel.
And his prayer, and he was entreated for him and all his sin, and his transgression, and the places where he built in them heights, and he set up statues and carved images before his humbling: behold them written upon the words of the seers.
And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in his house: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.
The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem.
And he will do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father: and to all the carved images which Manasseh his father made, Amon sacrificed, and he will serve them.
And he was not humbled from before Jehovah as Manasseh his father humbled himself; for this Amon multiplied trespass.
And his servants will conspire against him, and they will kill him in his house.
And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.
The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years he reigned in Jerusalem.
And he did the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and he went in the ways of David his father, and he turned not to the right and to the left.
And in the eighth year to his reigning, and he yet a youth, he began to seek to the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the heights, and the statues, and the carved images, and the molten images.
And they will pull down the altars of the Baals before him, and the images which were above from on high to them he cut down; and the statues and the carved images, and the molten images he break in pieces and beat small, and he will strew upon the face of the graves of those sacrificing to them.
And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and he will cleanse Judah and Jerusalem.
And in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim, and Simeon, and even to Naphtali he proved their houses round about.
And he will pull down the altars and the statues, and the carved images he beat down to make fine, and he cut down all the images in all the land of Israel, and he will turn back to Jerusalem.
And in the eighteenth year to his reigning, to cleanse the land and the house he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah chief of the city, and Joah son of Joahaz the rememberer to strengthen the house of Jehovah his God.
And they will come to Hilkiah the great priest, and they will give the silver being brought to the house of God, which the Levites watching the threshold gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.
And they will give to the hand of those appointed to do the work in the house of Jehovah, and they will give it to those doing the work, working in the house of Jehovah to repair and to strengthen the house.
And they will give to the artificers and to the builders to buy stones and woods for junctions, and to frame the houses which the kings of Judah destroyed.
And the men doing in the work in faithfulness: and over them being appointed Jahath and Obadiah the Levites from the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam from the sons of the Kohathites to superintend; and the Levites all understanding in instruments of song.
And over those carrying, and superintending to all doing the work for service and service: and from the Levites, scribes and leaders and gate-keepers.
And in their bringing forth the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by the band of Moses.
And Hilkiah will answer and say to Shaphan the scribe, I found a book of the law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah will give the book to Shaphan.
And Shaphan will bring the book to the king, and he will yet turn back word to the king, saying, All which was given into the hand of thy servants, they do.
And they will pour out the silver being found in the house of Jehovah, and they will give it to the hand of those reviewing, and to the hand of those doing the work.
And Shaphan the scribe will announce to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest gave a book to me. And Shaphan will read in it before the king.
And it will be when the king heard the words of the law, and he will rend his garments.
And the king will command Hilkiah, and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Abdon son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah servant of the king saying,
Go seek Jehovah for me, and for those being left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which was found: for great the wrath of Jehovah which is poured out upon us, because our fathers watched not the word of Jehovah to do according to all written upon this book.
And Hilkiah will go, and those of the king, to Huldah the prophetess, wife of Shallum son of Tikvath, son of Hasrah, watching the garments; (and she will dwell in Jerusalem in the second rank) and they will speak to her according to this.
And she will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Say to the man who sent you to me,
Thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, all the curses written upon the book which they read before the king of Judah:
Because that they forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, so that they irritated me with all the works of their hands; and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.
And to the king of Judah sending you to seek in Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel the words which thou heardest;
Because thy heart was tender, and thou wilt be humbled from before God in thy hearing his words against this place and against its inhabitants, and thou wilt be humbled before me, and thou wilt rend thy garments and weep before me; I also heard, says Jehovah.
Behold me gathering thee to thy fathers, and thou wert gathered to thy graves in peace, and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evil which I bring upon this place and upon its inhabitants. And they will turn back word to the king.
And the kind will send and gather together all the old men of Judah and Jerusalem.
And the king will go up to the house of Jehovah, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests and the Levites, and all the people, from great and even to small: and he will read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant being found in the house of Jehovah.
And the king will stand upon his standing, and he will cut out a covenant before Jehovah to go after Jehovah and to watch his commands and his testimonies, and his laws with all his heart and with all his soul, to do the words of the covenant being written upon this book.
And he will cause to stand all being found in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And they inhabiting Jerusalem will do according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
And Josiah will remove all the abominations out of all the lands which were to the sons of Israel, and he will cause to serve all being found in Israel, to serve Jehovah their God. All his days they departed not from after Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And Josiah will do in Jerusalem the passover to Jehovah: and they will slaughter the passover in the fourteenth day to the first month.
And he will cause the priests to stand upon their watches, and he will strengthen them to serve the house of Jehovah.
And he will say to the Levites causing to all Israel to understand, being consecrated to Jehovah, Ye shall give the holy ark into the house which Solomon son of David, king of Israel built: not to you a lifting up upon the shoulder: now serve ye Jehovah your God and his people Israel.
And prepare yourselves to the house of your fathers in your divisions, in the writing of David king of Israel, and in the writing of Solomon his son:
And stand ye in the holy place for the divisions of the house of the fathers to your brethren the sons of the people, and the division of the father's house to the Levites.
And slaughter ye the passover and consecrate yourselves, and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And Josiah will lift up to the sons of the people, sheep, lambs and sons of the goats, the whole for the paschal lambs for all being found to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand oxen: these from the king's substance.
And his chiefs for willingness to the people, to the priests and to the Levites, lifted up: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, leaders of the house of God, gave to the priests for paschal lambs, two thousand and six hundred, and three hundred oxen.
And Cononiah and Shemaiah, and Nathaniel his brethren, and Hashabiah, and Jeiel, and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, lifted up to the Levites for paschal lambs, five thousand, and five hundred oxen.
And the service will be prepared, and the priests will stand upon their standing, and the Levites upon their divisions according to the command of the king.
And they will slaughter the passover, and the priests will sprinkle from their hand, and the Levites flaying.
And they will remove the burnt-offering to give them to the divisions for the house of the fathers to the sons of the people, to bring near to Jehovah according to the writing in the book of Moses. And thus to the oxen.
And they will roast the passover in fire according to judgment: and the holy things they cooked in pots and in boilers, and in dishes, and they will cause to run to all the sons of the people.
And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests: for the priests the sons of Aaron in bringing up the burnt-offering and the fat, even till night; and the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
And those singing, sons of Asaph, upon their station according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the kings seer; and the porters at gate and gate; not for them to depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
And all the service of Jehovah will be prepared in that day to do the passover, and bring up the burnt-offerings upon the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of the king Josiah.
And the sons of Israel being found will do the passover in that time, and the festival of the unleavened seven days.
And a passover as this was not done in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; and all the kings of Israel did not like the passover which Josiah did, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel being found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year to the kingdom of Josiah was done this passover.

And I shall bring them forth to Iddo the head, with the silver of the place, and I shall set words in their mouth to speak to Iddo, his brethren the Nethinims, with the silver of the place, to bring to us those serving to the house of our God.
And they will bring to us according to the good hand of our God upon us a man of understanding from the sons of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel; and Sherebiah, and his sons and his brethren, eighteen.
And Hashabiab, and with him Jeshaiah, from the sons of Merari, brethren and their sons, twenty.
And from the Nethinims David gave, and the chiefs, for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were specified by names.
And I shall call a fast there, upon the river Ahava, to humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for us and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
For I was ashamed to ask from the king strength and horsemen to help us from the enemy in the way: for we said to the king, saying, The hand of our God upon all seeking him for good; and his strength and his anger against all forsaking him.
And we will fast and seek of our God concerning this; and he will be entreated for us.
And I shall separate from the chiefs of the priests twelve to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten from their brethren.
And I shall weigh to them the silver and the gold, and the vessels of the oblation of the house of God, that the king and his counselors and his chiefs and all Israel being found had lifted up.
And I shall weigh to their hand the silver, six hundred and fifty talents, and vessels of silver to a hundred talents; gold, a hundred talents;
And twenty goblets of gold to a thousand darics: and different vessels of good shining brass, desirable as gold.
And saying to them, Ye are holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold a voluntary gift to Jehovah the God of your fathers.
Watch and guard till ye shall weigh before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers to Israel in Jerusalem in the cells of the house of Jehovah.
And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem to the house of God.
And we removed from the river Ahava in the twelfth to the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the band of our God was upon us and he will deliver us from the hand of the enemy, and of him lying in wait upon the way.
And we shall come to Jerusalem, and shall dwell there three days.
And in the fourth day we shall weigh the silver and the gold and the vessels in the house of our God, by the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest; and with him Eleazar son of Phinehas; and with them Jozabad son of Joshua, and Noadiah son of Levites;

And they will give the king's laws to the king's satraps and prefects beyond the river: and they lifted up the people and the house of God.
And in these things being finished, the chiefs came near to me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites were not separated from the people of the lands according to their abominations, to the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian and the Amorite.
For they took from their daughters to themselves and to their sons: and the holy seed mingled themselves with the people of the lands: and the hand of the chiefs and the prophets was the first in this transgression.
And in my hearing this word I rent my garment and my robe, and I shall pluck off from the hair of my head and my beard, and I shall sit down, being astonished.
And to me all will assemble, trembling at the word of the God of Israel for the transgression of the exile; and I sat astonished till the sacrifice of the evening.
And at the sacrifice of the evening I rose up from my humbling; and in my rending my garment and my robe and I shall bend upon my knees and spread forth my hands to Jehovah my God.
And saying, My God, I was ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face, O my God, to thee: for our iniquities were multiplied over the head, and our guilt was magnified even to the heavens.
From the days of our fathers we are in a great trespass even to this day; and in our iniquities we were given, we, our kings, our priests, into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity and to plunder, and to shame of face as this day.
And now for a little moment grace was from Jehovah our God to leave to us an escaping, and to give to us a nail in his holy place, for our God to enlighten our eyes and to give us a little preservation of our life in our servitude.
For we are servants; and in our servitude God forsook us not, and he extended to us mercy before the kings of Persia, to give to us the preservation of life to set up the house of our God, and to cause its desolations to stand, and to give to us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
And now what shall we say, O our God, after this? for we forsook thy commands,
Which thou didst command by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying, The land which ye are coming in to inherit it being a land of uncleanness in the uncleanness of the people of the lands in their abominations which filled it from mouth to mouth in their pollution.
And now ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, and ye shall not take their daughters to your sons, and ye shall not seek their peace and their good even forever, so that ye shall be strong and eat the good of the land, and cause to your sons to inherit even forever.
And after all coming upon us for our evil deeds, and in our great guilt, for thou our God didst withhold below our iniquities, and didst give to us an escaping according to this.
Shall we turn back to break thy commands and to contract marriage with the people of these abominations? Wilt thou not be angry with us even to finishing, for not a remaining and escaping.
O Jehovah God of Israel, thou art just: for we remained an escaping as this day: behold us before thee in our guilts; for not to stand before thee for.

And Shecaniah son of Jehiel, from the sons of Elam, will answer and say to Ezra, We transgressed against our God, and we were dwelling with strange wives from the people of the land: and now there is hope to Israel concerning this.
And now we will cut out a covenant to our God to bring forth all the wives, and those being born of them upon the counsel of my lord, and of those trembling at the command of our God; and according to the law it shall be done.

And now ye shall give praise to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do acceptance: and separate from the people of the land and from the strange wives.
And all the convocation will answer and say, with a great voice, So to do according to thy words to us.
But the people many, and a time of heavy showers, and no power to stand without, and the work not for one day, and not for two: for we many transgressing in this word.
And our chiefs to all the convocation shall stand now, and all who in our cities dwelt with strange wives, shall come at the appointed times, and with them the old men of city and city, and its judges, until the turning back the burning of the anger of our God from us even for this word.
But Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahaziah, son of Tikvah, stood upon this: and Meshullam and Sabbethai the Levite helped them.
And thus the sons of the exile will do. And they will be separated, Ezra the priest, men, heads of the fathers, for the house of their fathers, and all of them by names, and they will it down in one day to the tenth month to seek out the word.
And they will finish with all the men dwelling with strange wives, even to one day to the first month.

And they will say to me, They being left which were left of the captivity there in the province, in great evil and in reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem being broken down, and its gates were burnt with fire.
And it will be in my hearing these words, I sat down, and I shall weep and mourn days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of the heavens,
And saying, Now O Jehovah, God of the heavens, the great and terrible God watching the covenant and mercy to those loving him, and to those watching his commands:
Will now thine ear be attentive and thine eye opened to hear to the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee this day, day and night, for the sons of Israel thy servants, and confess for the sins of the sons of Israel which we sinned against thee? and and the house of my father sinned.
Being perverse, we were perverse against thee, and we watched not the commands and the laws and the judgments which thou didst command Moses thy servant.
Remember now the word that thou didst command Moses thy servant, saying, Ye will transgress; I will scatter you among the nations:
And did ye turn back to me and watch my commands and do them; if there shall be a thrusting forth of you into the extremity of the heavens, from thence will I gather them and bring them to the place which I chose for my name to dwell there.
And these thy servants and thy people whom thou didst redeem in thy great power and by thy strong hand.
Now, O Lord, now will thine ear be attending to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, desiring to fear thy name? and prosper now to thy servant this day: and wilt thou give him for compassion before this man? And I was giving drink to the king.
And it will be in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year to Arthasatha the king, wine before him: and I shall lift up the wine and give to the king. And I was not sad before him.

And saying to the king, O king, thou wilt live forever: wherefore shall not my face be sad when the city of the house of my father's sepulchres was laid waste, and its gates consumed with fire?

And Tobiah the Ammonite near him, and he will say, Also that they are building, if a fox shall go up, and he brake their walls of stones.
Hear, O our God; for we were despised: and turn back their reproach upon their head, and wilt thou give them for plunder in the land of captivity?
And thou wilt not cover over their iniquity, and their sin shall not be wiped away before thee: for they provoked before the builders.
And we shall build the wall; and all the wall will be completed even to its half: and a heart will be to the people to work.

And I shall set from underneath to the place from behind to the wall upon the dry places, and I shall set the people to the families with their swords, their spears and their bows.
And I shall see, and I shall rise up and say to the nobles and to the prefects and to the rest of the people, Ye shall not be afraid from their face: remember Jehovah great and terrible; and war for yourselves, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.
And it will be that when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God will disperse their counsel, and we shall turn back all of us to the wall, each to his work.
And it will be from that day the half of my young men doing in the work, and half of them holding fast and the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the chiefs behind every house of Judah.
They building upon the wall, and they bearing in the burden, they loading with one of his hands doing in the work, and one holding fast the weapon.
And the builders, a man his sword being girded upon his loins, and building. And he striking upon the trumpet near me.
And saying to the nobles and to the prefects and to the rest of the people, The work much and broad, and we being scattered upon the wall, far off a man from his brother.
In the place which ye shall hear the voice of the trumpet there ye shall gather together to us; our God shall war for us.
And we doing in the work: and half of them holding fast upon the spears from the ascending of the dawn even till the coming forth of the stars.
Also in that time I said to the people, A man and his youth shall lodge in the midst of Jerusalem; and they were watching for us in the night, and work in the day.
And not I and my brethren and my young men, and the men of the watch which were after me, we not putting off our garments; a man his weapon for water.
And a cry of the people and their wives will be great against their brethren the Jews.
And there is which saying, Our sons and our daughters, we being many: and we will take grain and we will eat and live.
And there are those saying, Our fields and our vineyards and our houses we pledge, and we will take grain in the famine.
And there are those saying, We borrowed silver for the king's tribute, our fields and our vineyards.
And now according to the flesh of our brethren, our flesh; as their sons, our sons: and behold, we subdue our sons and our daughters for servants, and there is from our daughters being subdued: and not to the strength of our hand and our fields and our vineyards to others.
And it will kindle to me greatly as I heard their cry and these words.
And my heart will take counsel to me, and I shall contend with the nobles and the prefects, and say to them, Ye impose a debt each upon his brother. And I shall give a great convocation against them.
And saying to them, We bought off our brethren the Jews, being sold to the nations; according to the sufficiency in us and also will ye sell your brethren? and were they sold to us? And they will be silent, and they found not a word.
And it will be said, Not good the word which ye do: will ye not go in the fear of our God from the reproach of the nations our enemies?
And also I, my brethren and my young men exacting upon them silver and grain: we will leave off now this debt.
Turn back now to them according to this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive trees, and their houses, and the hundredth of the silver and the grain, the new wine and the new oil which ye impose upon them.
And they will say, We will turn back, and we will not seek from them; thus will we do as thou sayest And I shall call the priests and shall cause them to swear to do according to this word.
Also I shook out my arm, and said, Thus God will shake out every man who will not raise up this word from his house and from his labor; so shall he be shaken out and emptied. And all the convocation will say, Amen, and praise Jehovah. And the people did according to this word.
Also from the day which it was commanded me to be their prefect in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year and even to the thirty and second year to Arthasatha the king, twelve years I and my brethren ate not the bread of the prefect.
And the former prefects that were before me made heavy upon the people, and they will take from them in bread and wine, the last silver forty shekels; also their young men ruled over the people: and I did not thus from the face of the fear of God.
And also I held fast upon the work of this wall, and we bought not a field: and all my young men being gathered there for the work.
And the Jews and prefects a hundred and fifty men, and they coming to us from the nations that were round about us; to my table.
And what was done for one day, one ox, six choice sheep; and birds were done for me, and within ten days with every wine for abundance: and with this, the bread of the prefect I sought not for the servitude was heavy upon this people.
Remember to me, my God, for good, all that I did for this people.
And it will be as it was heard by Sanballat and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our enemies, that I built the wall and a breach was not left in it; also even to this time I set not up the doors in the gates;
And Sanballat sent to me and Geshem, saying, Come, and we will pass over together in the villages in the valley of Ono. And they reckoned to do evil to me.
And I shall send messengers to them, saying, I do a great work, and I shall not be able to come down: wherefore shall the work cease when I shall desist and come down to you?
And they will send to me according to this word four times; and I shall turn them back according to this word.
And Sanballat will send his young man to me according to this word the fifth time, and a letter opened in his hand;
Being written in it, It was heard in the nations, and Geshem said, Thou and the Jews are reckoning to rebel: for this thou buildest the wall, and thou to be to them for king according to these words.
And also thou didst set up prophets to call upon thee in Jerusalem, saying, A king in Judah: and now it will be heard by the king according to these words: and now come and we will counsel together.
And I shall send to him saying, It was not according to these words which thou sayest, for from thy heart thou feignest them.
For all of them causing us to be afraid, saying, their hands shall be slackened from the work, and it shall not be done. And now strengthen my hand.
And I came to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabeel, and he was shut up; and he will say, We will pass over to the house of God into the midst of the temple, and we will shut the doors of the temple: for they are coming to kill thee; and by night coming to kill thee.
And saying, Shall a man like me flee? and who as I that shall go into the temple and live? I will not go in.
And I shall know, and behold, not God sent him; for he spake the prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat hired him.
So that he was hired that I shall be afraid and do thus, and sin, and it was to them for an evil name, so that they shall reproach me.
Remember, O my God, to Tobiah and to Sanballat, according to these his works, and also to Noadiah the prophetess, and to the rest of the prophets who were causing me to fear.
And the wall will be completed in the twenty and fifth to Elul, to fifty and two days.
And it will be as all our enemies heard, and all the nations that were round about us saw, and they will fall greatly in their own eyes: and they knew that from God was done this work.
Also in these days the nobles of Judah were multiplying their letters going to Tobiah, and those to Tobiah came to them.
For many in Judah being married by oath to him for he was son-in-law to Shechaniah son of Arah; and Johanan his son took the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah.
Also his good things were said before me, and my words were brought forth to him. Tobiah sent letters to cause me to fear.

Thou thyself, O Jehovah, thou alone, didst make the heavens, the heavens of heavens, with all their army, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them, and thou makest alive all of them: and the army of the heavens worshiping to thee.
Thou thyself Jehovah the God who chose in Abram, and thou broughtest him from Ur of the Chaldees, and didst set his name Abraham.
And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee, and thou didst cut out a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perezzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give to his seed: and thou wilt set up thy words, for thou art just:
And thou wilt see the humbling of our fathers in Egypt, and thou heardest their cry upon the sea of sedge:
And thou wilt give signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they acted proudly against them. And thou wilt make to thee a name as this day.
And thou didst cleave asunder the sea before them, and they will pass over in the midst of the sea upon dry land; and those pursuing them thou didst cast into the depths as a stone into the strong waters.
And in a pillar of cloud thou didst guide them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, to enlighten the way to them that they shall go in it.
And upon mount Sinai thou camest down, and speaking with them from the heavens, and thou wilt give to them right judgments, and laws of truth, good laws and commands.
And thou didst make known to them thy holy Sabbath, and commands, and ordinances, and law; thou didst charge to them by the hand of Moses thy servant:
And bread from the heavens thou gavest to them for their hunger, and water from the rock thou broughtest forth to them for their thirst; and thou wilt say to them to go in and to inherit the land which thou didst lift up thy hand to give to them.
And they and our fathers acted proudly, and they will harden their neck, and will not hear to thy commands,
And they will refuse to hear, and they will not remember thy wonders which thou didst with them; and they will harden their necks, and they will give a head to turn back to their servitude in their perverseness: and thou a God of forgivenesses, merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and great of mercy, and thou didst not forsake them.
Also when they made to them a molten calf, and they will say, This thy God which brought thee up from Egypt; and they will make great reproaches;
And thou in thy many compassions forsookest them not in the desert: not removing the pillar of cloud from above them in the day to guide them in the way; and the pillar of fire in the night, to enlighten to them, and the way that they shall go in it.
And thy good spirit thou gavest to instruct them, and thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and water gavest thou to them for their thirst.
And forty years thou didst nourish them in the desert; they wanted not; their garments fell not away, and their feet swelled not.
And thou wilt give to them kingdoms and nations, and thou wilt divide them to the extremity: and they will inherit the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
And their sons thou didst multiply as the stars of the heavens, and thou wilt bring them to the land which thou saidst to their fathers to come in to possess.
And their sons will come in and possess the land, and thou wilt subdue before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and thou wilt give them into their hand, and all their kings, and the nations of the land, to do them according to their will.
And they will take inaccessible cities, and a fat land, and they will inherit houses full of all good, and wells hewed out, vineyards and olive trees, and the tree of food for abundance: and they will eat and be filled, and be fat, and will live delicately in thy great goodness.
And they will be perverse, and they will rebel against thee, and they will cast thy law behind their back, and they killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them back to thee, and they will make great reproaches.
And thou wilt give them into the hand of their adversaries, and they will press upon them: and in the time of their straits they will cry to thee, and thou wilt hear from the heavens; and according to thy many compassion thou wilt give to them saviours, and they will save them from the hand of their adversaries.
And when rest to them they will turn back to do evil before thee: and thou wilt leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they will come down upon them: and they will turn back and cry to thee, and thou from the heavens wilt hear, and wilt deliver them according to thy compassion, many times.
And thou wilt testify against them to turn them back to thy law: and they acted proudly and heard not to thy commands, and in thy judgments they sinned in them; (which a man shall do and he lived in them) and they will give a shoulder turning aside, and they hardened their neck and heard not.
And thou wilt protract over them many years, and thou wilt testify against them by thy spirit in the hand of thy prophets: and they gave not ear, and thou wilt give them into the hand of the people of the lands.
And in thy many compassions thou madest them not a finishing, and thou didst not forsake them; for thou a God merciful and compassionate.
And now our God, the great the mighty, and the terrible God, watching the covenant and the mercy, it shall not be little before thee all the distress which found us, to our kings, to our chiefs, to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers, and to all thy people from the days of the kings of Assur even to this day.
And thou art just for all brought upon us; for thou didst the truth and we were evil:
And our kings, our chiefs, our priests and our fathers, they did not thy law, and they attended not to thy commands and thy testimonies which thou didst testify against them.
And they in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness which thou gavest to them, and in the broad and fat land which thou gavest before them, served not thee, and turned not back from their evil works.
Behold, we this day are servants, and the land which thou gavest to our fathers to eat its fruit and its goodness, behold, we are servants upon it:
And its produce being much for the kings whom thou gavest over us in our sins: and ruling over our bodies and upon our cattle according to their will, and we in great straits.
And for all this we cut out faithfulness, and write; and upon the sealing, our chiefs, our Levites, and our priests.

And he will make for him a great cell, and there before them were given the gifts, the frankincense and the vessels, and the tenth of the grain of the new wine and the new oil, (the command of the Levites, and those singing, and the gate-keepers,) and the oblations of the priests.
And in all this I was not in Jerusalem: for in the thirty and second year to Arthasatha king of Babel, I came to the king, and at the end of days I asked for myself from the king:
And I shall come to Jerusalem, and I shall understand upon the evil which Eliashib did for Tobiah to prepare for him a cell in the enclosures of the house of God.
And it will be greatly evil to me: and I shall cast forth all the vessels of the house of Tobiah without from the cell.
And saying, and they will purify the cells: and I shall turn back there the vessels of the house of God, with the gift and the frankincense.
And I shall know that the portions of the Levites were not given: and they will flee a man to his field, the Levites and those singing, doing the work.
And I shall contend with the prefects, and say, Wherefore was the house of God forsaken? And I shall gather them together, and cause them to stand upon their standing.
And all Judah brought the tenth of the grain and the new wine and the new oil to the treasuries.
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites: and upon their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah: for they were reckoned faithful: and upon them to divide out to their brethren.
Remember to me, O my God, concerning this, and thou wilt not wipe out my kindness which I did in the house of my God, and in its watches.
In those days I saw in Judah those treading the wine-presses in the Sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and loading upon the asses; and also wine, grapes, and figs, and every burden, and bringing into Jerusalem in the day of the Sabbath: and I shall testify in the day of their selling provision.
And the Tyrians sat in it, bringing in fish and every selling, and selling in the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
And I shall contend with the nobles of Judah, and say to them, What this evil word that ye are doing, and profaning the day of the Sabbath?
Did not your fathers thus, and our God will bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? and ye are adding burning upon Israel to profane the Sabbath.
And it will be as the gates of Jerusalem were darkened before the Sabbath, and saying, and the doors shall be shut, and saying that they shall not open them till after the Sabbath: and from my young men I caused to stand at the gates; a burden shall not be brought in in the day of the Sabbath.
And the merchants and those selling every selling will lodge from without to Jerusalem once and twice.
And I shall testify against them, and say to them, Wherefore are ye lodging before the wall? if ye shall do it a second time I will stretch forth the hand against you From that time they came not upon the Sabbath.
And saying to the Levites that they shall be purifying, and coming, watching the gates to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Also this remember for me, O my God, and spare upon me according to the multitude of thy mercy.
Also in those days I saw Jews who caused to dwell women, Ashdodites, Ammonites, Moabites:
And their sons half speaking the Ashdod dialect, and they not knowing to speak the Judean dialect, and according to the tongue of people and people.
And I shall contend with them, and I shall curse them and I shall strike of them men, and I shall make them bald, and cause them to swear by God, If ye shall give your daughters to their sons, and if ye shall lift up from their daughters to your sons and to yourselves.
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin concerning these? and in many nations was there not a king like him, and he was loved by his God, and God will give him king over all Israel: also him did women strangers cause to sin.
And to you shall we hear to do all this great evil to transgress against our God to cause strange women to dwell.
And from the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the great priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: and I shall cause him to flee from me.
Remember to them, O my God, for the pollutions of the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
And I cleansed them from every stranger, and I shall set up watches to the priests and to the Levites, a man in his work.
And for the bringing near the woods in the times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember to me, O my God for good.
And it will be in the days of Ahasuerus, (this Ahasuerus reigned from India and even to Cush; seven and twenty and one hundred provinces:)
In those days, when king Ahasuerus sat upon the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the fortress,
In the third year to his reign he made a drinking to all his chiefs and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and chiefs of the provinces before him:
In his causing to see the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the honor of his great splendor many days, eighty and one hundred days.
And in these days being completed the king made to all the people being found in Shushan the fortress, a drinking to the great and even to the small, seven days, in the enclosure of the garden of the king's house;
Splendid fine white linen, and cerulean purple, made fast with cords of byssus and purple, upon rings of silver and pillars of marble: couches of gold and silver upon a tesselated pavement of marble, and marble and pearl and spotted marble.
And giving drink in vessels of gold and vessels different from vessels, and wine of the kingdom, an abundance, according to the hand of the king.
Giving to drink according to the edict; none compelling, for thus the king appointed to all the multitude of his house to do according to the desire of man and man.
Also Vashti the queen made a drinking to the women of the house of the kingdom which was to king Ahasuerus.
In the seventh day, as the heart of the king being good with wine, he said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs serving the face of king Ahasuerus,
To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown of the kingdom, to cause the people and the chiefs to see her beauty: for she was good of appearance.
And the queen Vashti will refuse to come in at the word of the king which was by the hand of the eunuchs: and the king will be angry greatly, and his wrath burnt in him.
And the king will say to the wise knowing the times, (for thus spake the king before all knowing the edict and judgment:
And there drew near to him Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven chiefs of Persia and Media, seeing the face of the king, sitting the first in the kingdom;)
According to the edict what to do against the queen Vashti, for that she did not the word of the king Ahasuerus by the hand of the eunuchs?
And Memucan will say before the king, Not against the king alone did Vashti the queen do evil, but against all the chiefs and against all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
For the word of the queen will go forth ball the women to cause their husbands to be despised in their eyes, in their saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen before him, and she came not.
And this day shall the chief ladies of Persia and Media say, which heard the word of the queen to all the chiefs of the king, and according to contempt and reproach.
If good to the king, the word of the kingdom shall go forth from before him, and it shall be written in the edict of the Persians and Medea, and it shall not pass away, that Vashti shall not come before the king Ahasuerus; and the king shall give her kingdom to her companion good above her.
And the decree of the king which he shall make being heard in all his kingdom, (for it is great,) and all the women shall give honor to their husbands, to the great and even to the small.
And the word will be good in the eyes of the king and the chiefs; and the king will do according to the word of Memucan.
And he will send letters to all the provinces of the king, to provinces and provinces, according to its writing, and to people and people, according to their tongue, for every man to be ruling in his house; and being spoken according to the tongue of his people.
After these words, as the wrath of the king Ahasuerus was quiet, he remembered Vashti, and what she did, and what was decided against her:
And the king's young men will say, those serving him, They shall seek for the king, maidens, virgins good of appearance:
And the king shall appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom, and they shall gather together all the maidens, virgins, good of appearance, to Shushan the fortress, to the house of the women, to the hand of Hegai, the king's eunuch, watching the women; giving their purifications:
And the maiden who shall be good in the eyes of the king shall reign instead of Vashti. And the word will be good in the eyes of the king; and he will do so.
A man, a Jew, was in Shushan the fortress, and his name Mordecai, son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a man, a Benjamite;
Who was carried captive from Jerusalem with the captivity which was carried into exile with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel carried into exile.
And he will be nourishing Hadassah (this is Esther) his uncle's daughter: for not to her, father and mother, and the maiden beautiful of form and good of aspect; and in the death of her father and her mother; Mordecai took her to him for a daughter.
And it will be in hearing the word of the king and his edict, and in the gathering together of the many maidens to Shushan the fortress, to the hand of Hegai, and Esther will be taken to the house of the king to the hand of Hegai watching the women.
And the maiden will be good in his eyes, and she will receive mercy before him; and he will hasten her purifications, and to give her portion to her, and to give to her seven chosen maidens from the house of the king: and he will change her and her maidens for good to the house of the women.
Esther announced not her people and her birth: for Mordecai commanded to her that she shall not announce.
And in every day and day, Mordecai going about before the enclosure of the house of the women, to know the peace of Esther, and what will be done with her.
And in the coming of the order of maiden and maiden to come in to the king Ahasuerus, from the end of there being to her, according to edict; of women twelve months (for so shall be completed the days of their purifications, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the purifications of the women;)
And thus came the maiden to the king; all which she shall say shall be given to her, to come with her from the house of the women even to the, house of the king.
In the evening she came, and in the morning she turned back to the second house of the women, to the hand of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch watching the concubines: she will no more come to the king except the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
And in the coming of the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, which he took to him for a daughter, to go in to the king, she sought not a word except what Hegai the king's eunuch watching the women shall say. And Esther will be taking up favor in the eyes of all seeing her.
And Esther will be taken to the king Ahasuerus, to the house of his kingdom, in the tenth month, this the month Tebeth, in the seventh year to his kingdom.
And the king will love Esther above all the women, and she will receive favor and mercy before him above all the virgins; and he will set the crown of the kingdom upon her head, and he will cause her to reign instead of Vashti.
And the king will make a great drinking to all his chiefs and his servants; Esther's drinking; and he made rest to the provinces, and he will give a lifting up according to the hand of the king.
And in the gathering together the virgins the second time, and Mordecai sat in the gate of the king.
And Esther not announcing her kindred and her people, as Mordecai commanded to her: and Esther did the saying of Mordecai as when she was in bringing up with him.
In those days, and Mordecai sat in the gate of the king, Bigthan was angry, and Teresh, two eunuchs of the king watching the threshold; and they will seek to stretch forth the hand against the king Ahasuerus.
And the word will be known to Mordecai, and he will announce to Esther the queen; and Esther will tell to the king in the name of Mordecai.
And the word will be sought out and found, and they two will be hung upon a tree: and it will be written in the book of the words of the days before the king.
After these words the king Ahasuerus magnified Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite; and he will lift him up and set his seat above all the chiefs that were with him.
And all the king's servants which were in the king's gate were bowing and worshiping to Haman; for thus the king commanded for him. And Mordecai will not bow, and he will not worship.
And the king's servants that were in the king's gate will say to Mordecai, Wherefore dost thou pass by the king's Command?
And it will be in their saying to him day and day, and he will not hear to them, and they will announce to Haman to see whether the words of Mordecai will stand: for he announced to them that he was a Jew.
And Haman will see that Mordecai bowed not, and not worshiping to him, and Haman will be filled with wrath.
And it will be despised in his eyes to stretch forth the hand against Mordecai alone; for they announced to him the people of Mordecai: and Haman will seek to destroy all the Jews which are in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.
In the first month (this the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year to the king Ahasuerus, he cast Pur (this is the lot) before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, this the twelfth the month Adar.
And Haman will say to king Ahasuerus, There is one people scattered and dispersed between the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws different from all people; they not doing the laws of the king: and it not being suitable to the king to suffer them.
If good to the king, it shall be written to destroy them: and I will weigh ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those doing the work, to bring to the king's treasures.
And the king will remove the signet ring from his hand, and will give it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, to press the Jews.
And the king will say to Haman, The silver is given to thee, and the people, to do with them as is good in thine eyes.
And the king's scribes will be called in the first month, in the thirteenth day in it, and it will be written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps and to the prefects, which were over province and province, and to the chiefs of people and people of province and province, according to its writing, and people and people according to their tongue; in the name of king Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king's signet ring.
And the letters were sent by the hand of the runners to all the king's provinces, to cut off, to kill and to destroy, all the Jews, from the youth and even to the old man, the little ones and women, in one day, in the thirteenth to the twelfth month, (this the month Adar) and their spoil for plunder.
A copy of the writing to be given an edict in every province and province, being manifested to all peoples to be ready for that day.
And they running went forth, being impelled by the word of the king, and the edict was given in Shushan the fortress. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; and the city Shushan was disquieted.
And Mordecai knew all that was done, and Mordecai will rend his garments, and put on sackcloth and ashes, and he will go forth into the city, and he will cry out a great and bitter cry;
And he will come even before the king's gate: for none to come into the king's gate in putting on sackcloth.
And in every province and province the place where the word of the king and his edict coming, great mourning to the Jews, and fasting and weeping and wailing; sackcloth and ashes will be spread to many.
And Esther's maidens will go in, and her eunuchs, and they will announce to her: and the queen will be greatly grieved; and she will send garments to clothe Mordecai and to put away his sackcloth from off him: and he received not.
And Esther will call to Hatach from the king's eunuchs, whom he caused to stand before her, and she will give him a charge to Mordecai, to know what this, and for what this.
And Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.
And Mordecai will announce to him all which befell him, and the exposition of the silver which Haman said to weigh to the king's treasures for the Jews to destroy them.
And the copy of the writing of the edict which was given in Shushan to destroy them, he gave to him to cause Esther to see, and to announce to her, and to charge upon her to go in to the king to implore mercy, and to seek from before him for her people.
And Hatach will go in and announce to Esther the words of Mordecai.
And Esther will say to Hatach, and will give him a charge to Mordecai;
All the king's servants, and the people of the kings provinces, knowing that every man and woman who shall go in to the king to the inner enclosure who shall not be called, one edict of his to put to death only which the king shall stretch out to him the sceptre of gold, and he lived: and I was not called to go in to the king this thirty days.
And they will announce to Mordecai, Esther's words.
And Mordecai will tell to turn back to Esther, Thou wilt not imagine in thy soul to escape in the house of the king more than all the Jews.
For if being silent, thou shalt be silent in this time, breath and deliverance shall stand up to the Jews from another place; and thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who shall know if for a time like this thou camest to the kingdom?
And Esther will tell to turn back to Mordecai:
Go collect together all the Jews being found in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and ye shall not eat and ye shall not drink three days, night and day also I and my maidens will fast thus and in this I will go in to the king which is not according to the edict; and according to that I perished, I perished.
And Mordecai will pass by, and will do according to all that Esther charged upon him.
And it will be in the third day, Esther will put on dominion, and she will stand in the enclosure of the king's house, the interior before the king's house: and the king will sit upon the throne of his kingdom, in the house of the kingdom, before the door of the house.
And it will be when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the enclosure, she received favor in his eyes: and the king will stretch out to Esther the sceptre of gold which is in his hand: and Esther will draw near and touch upon the head of the sceptre.
And the king will say to her, What to thee, Esther the queen? what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom and it shall be given to thee.
And Esther will say, If good to the king, will the king come, and Haman, this day, to the drinking which I made for him?
And the king will say, Hasten ye Haman to do the word of Esther. And the king will go in, and Haman, to the drinking which Esther made.
And the king will say to Esther at the drinking of wine, What thy asking? and it shall be given to thee: and what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done.
And Esther will answer and say, My asking and my seeking:
If I found favor in the eyes of the king, and if good to the king to give my asking and to do my seeking, the king shall come and Haman to the drinking that I shall make for them, and to-morrow I will do as the king said.
And Haman went forth in that day being glad and good of heart: and when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and he rose not up and moved not himself for him, and Haman will be filled with wrath against Mordecai.
And Haman will contain himself, and will go in to his house; and he will send and cause his friends to come, and Zeresh his wife.
And Haman will recount to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all how the king magnified him, and how he lifted him up over the chiefs and servants of the king.
And Haman will say also, Esther the queen caused none to come in with the king to the drinking which she made but me; and also to-morrow I am called to her with the king.
And all this was not an equivalent to me in all the time which I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the king's gate.
And Zeresh his wife will say to him, and all his friends, Make ye a tree high fifty cubits, and in the morning say thou to the king, and they shall hang Mordecai upon it: and go thou in with the king to the drinking, being glad. And the word will be good before Haman; and he will make the tree.
In that night the king's sleep fled away, and he will say to bring in the book of memorials of the words of the days; and they will be read before the king.
And it will be found written that Mordecai announced concerning Bigthana and Teresh, the king's two eunuchs watching the threshold, who sought to stretch forth the hand upon the king Ahasuerus.
And the king will say, What honor was done and greatness to Mordecai for this? And the young men of the king serving him will say, Not a word was done with him.
And the king will say, Who is in the enclosure? And Haman came to the enclosure of the king's house the exterior, to say to the king to hang Mordecai upon the tree which he prepared for him.
And the king's young men will say to him, Behold, Haman standing in the enclosure. And the king will say, He shall come in.
And Haman will come in. And the king will say to him, What to be done for the man whom the king delighted in his honor? And Haman will say in his heart, To whom will the king delight to do honor more abundantly than me?
And Haman will say to the king, The man whom the king delighted in his honor,
They shall bring in the clothing of the kingdom which the king was clothed in, it and the horse which the king rode upon him, and the crown of the kingdom which was given upon his head:
And giving the clothing and the horse to the hand of a man of the chiefs of the king, the nobles; and clothe the man which the king delighted in his honor, and cause him to ride upon the horse in the broad place of the city, and tall before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted in his honor.
And the king will say to Haman, Hasten; take the clothing and the horse according as thou spakest, and do thus to Mordecai the Jew, sitting in the king's gate: not a word shall fall from all which thou spakest.
And Haman will take the clothing and the horse, and he will clothe Mordecai, and cause him to ride in the broad place of the city, and he will call before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighted in his honor.
And Mordecai will turn back to the king's gate. And Haman hastened to his house, and the head covered.
And Haman will recount to Zeresh his wife, and to all his friends, all which befell him. And his wise men and Zeresh his wife will say to him, If Mordecai be from the seed of the Jews which thou didst begin to fall before him, thou shalt not prevail against him; for falling, thou shalt fall before him.
They yet speaking with him, and the king's eunuchs drew near, and they will hasten to bring Haman to the drinking which Esther made.
And the king will go in and Haman to drink with Esther the queen.
And the king will say to Esther also in the second day at the drinking of wine, What thy asking, queen Esther? and it shall be given to thee: and what thy seeking? even to the half of the kingdom and it shall be done.
And Esther the queen will answer and say, If I found grace in thine eyes, O king, and if good to the king, my soul shall be given to me in my asking, and my people in my seeking.
For we were sold, I and my people, to cut off, to kill and to destroy. And if for servants and for maids we were sold, I was silent, but the enemy made not even for the loss of the king.
And the king Ahasuerus will say, and he will say to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, whom his heart filled him to do thus?
And Esther will say, The man, the adversary and enemy, this evil Haman. And Haman was terrified from before the king and the queen.
And the king rose up in his wrath from the drinking of wine, to the garden of the palace: and Haman stood up to seek out for his soul from Esther the queen; for he saw that evil was completed for him from the king.
And the king turned back from the garden of the palace to the house of the drinking of wine; and Haman fell upon the bed which Esther was upon And the king will say, Also is he to force the queen with me in the house? The word went forth from the king's mouth, and they covered Haman's face.
And Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, will say before the king, Also behold the tree which Haman made for Mordecai who spake good for the king, standing in Haman's house, high fifty cubits: And the king will say, Ye shall hang him upon it.
And they will hang Haman upon the tree that he preps for Mordecai. And the wrath of the king subsided.
In that day the king Ahasuerus gave to Esther the queen, the house of Haman the Jews enemy. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther announced what he was to her.
And the king will remove his signet ring which he caused to pass from Haman, and he will give it to Mordecai. And Esther will set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
And Esther will add and she will speak before the king, and she will fall before his feet and weep, and make supplication to him to cause the evil of Haman the Agagite to pass away, and his purpose that he purposed against the Jews.
And the king will stretch out to Esther the scepter of gold: and Esther will rise and stand before the king,
And she will say, If good to the king, and if I found favor before him, and the word be right before the king, and I good in his eyes, it shall be written to turn back the writings, the purposes of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, that he wrote to destroy the Jews that were in all the king's provinces:
For how shall I be able and I looked upon the evil which shall be found with my people? And how shall I be able and I looked upon the destruction of my kindred?
And the king Ahasuerus will say to Esther the queen, and to Mordecai the Jew, The house of Haman I gave to Esther, and they hung him upon the tree because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews.
And write ye for the Jews as is good in your eyes, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's signet ring: for the writing which was written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's signet ring, none to turn back.
And the king's scribes will be called in that time in the third month, (this the month Sivan) in the three and twentieth in it; and it will be written according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the prefects, and the chiefs of the provinces which are from India and even to Cush, seven and twenty and a hundred provinces, province and province according to its writing, and people and people according to their tongue, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their tongue.
And he will write in the name of the king Ahasuerus, and seal with the king's signet ring; and he will send letters by the hand of runners on horses riding the courser, the mules, sons of mares:
Which the king gave to the Jews which were in every city and city to gather together, and to stand for their soul, to cut off, and to kill and to destroy all the power of the people and province pressing upon them, little ones and women, and their spoil for booty,
In one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, in the thirteenth to the twelfth month, this the month Adar.
The copy of the writing to be given an edict in every province and province, revealed to all the peoples, and for the Jews to be ready for this day to avenge themselves of their enemies.
The runners riding the courser, the mules, went forth, being hastened and impelled by the word of the king. And the edict was given in Shushan the fortress.
And Mordecai went forth from before the king in clothing of the kingdom, cerulean purple, and white, and a great crown of gold, and a wide robe of byssus and purple: and the city Shushan shouted and was glad:
There was to the Jews light and gladness and joy and honor.
And in every province and province, and in every city and city, the place where the word of the king and his edict coming, gladness and joy to the Jews, a drinking and a good day. And many peoples of the land becoming Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
And in the twelfth month (this the month Adar) in the thirteenth day in it, when the word of the king drew near, and his edict to do in the day that the enemies of the Jews expected to have power over them, (and it was turned that these Jews will have power over those hating them:)
The Jews were gathered together in their cities in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to stretch forth the hand upon those seeking their evil: and a man stood not before them, for their fear fell upon all the peoples.
And all the chiefs of the provinces, and the satraps, and the prefects, and those doing the work that was for the king, were lifting up with the Jews; for the fear of Mordecai fell upon them:
For great was Mordecai in the house of the king, and his fame went into all the provinces: for the man Mordecai went and was magnified.
And the Jews will strike against all their enemies with the blow of the sword, and killing and destruction; and they will do according to their desire upon those hating them.
And in Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
Parshandatha and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
The ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the Jews enemy, they slew; and upon the prey they stretched not out their hand.
In that day came the number of those slain in Shushan the fortress before the king.
And the king will say to Esther the queen, In Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men, and the ten sons of Haman: in the rest of the king's provinces what did they? and what thy asking? and it shall be given to thee: and what more thy seeking? and it shall be done.
And Esther will say, If good to the king, it shall be given also to-morrow to the Jews that are in Shusan to do according to the edict of the day, and they shall hang Haman's ten sons upon the tree.
And the king will say to do this. And the edict will be given in Shushan; and they hung the ten sons of Haman.
For the Jews that were in Shushan will gather together also in the fourteenth day to the month Adar, and they will kill in Shushan three hundred men; and upon the prey they sent not the hand.
And the rest of the Jews which were in the king's provinces gathered together and stood for their soul, and rested from their enemies, and slew among their enemies five and seventy thousand; and upon the prey they sent not their hand.
In the thirteenth day to the month Adar, and resting in the fourteenth in it, and making it a day of drinking and gladness.
And the Jews that were in Shushan were assembled in the thirteenth in it, and in the fourteenth in it; and resting in the fifteenth in it, and making it a day of drinking and gladness.
For this the Jews of the villages and in cities of the open country making the fourteenth day to the month Adar, gladness and drinking, and a good day, and sending portions a man to his neighbor.
And Mordecai will write these words, and send letters to all the Jews that were in all the king Ahasuerus's provinces, near and far off,
To set up to them to be doing the fourteenth day to the month Adar, and the fifteenth day in it, in every year and year,
As the days which the Jews rested in them from their enemies, and the month that was turned to them from grief to gladness, and from mourning to a good day, to make them days of drinking and gladness, and sending portions a man to his neighbor, and gifts to the needy.
And the Jews admitting what they began to do, and what Mordecai wrote to them.
For Haman son of Hammedatha the Amite, oppressing all the Jews, purposed against the Jews to destroy them, and he cast Pur (this the lot) to discomfit them and to destroy them;
And in her coming before the king, he said by letter he will turn back his purpose of evil that he purposed against the Jews upon his head: and they hung him and his sons upon the tree.
For this they called to these days Purim, for the name of Pur. For this upon all the words of this epistle, and What they saw upon this, and what came to them,
The Jews set up and admitted upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all joining themselves to them, and they shall not pass by to be doing these two days according to their writing, and according to their time in every year and year;
And these days being remembered and done in every generation and generation, family and family, province and province, city and city; and these days of the lots shall not pass by from the midst of the Jews, and their remembrance shall not be ended from their seed.
And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, will write with all power to set up the epistle of Purim, this second.
And he will send the letter to all the Jews, to the seventy and twenty and a hundred provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, words of peace and truth,
To set up these days of Purim in their times, as Mordecai the Jew set up to them, and Esther the queen, and as they set up for their souls and for their seed, the words of fastings and their cry:
And the saying of Esther set up these words of Purim; and it was written in the book.
And the king Ahasuerus will set up a tribute upon the land, and the isles of the sea.
And all the work of his power and his strength, and the exposition of the greatness of Mordecai which the king magnified him, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Media and Persia?
For Mordecai the Jew was second to the king Ahasuerus, and great to the Jews, and acceptable to the multitude of his brethren, seeking good for his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
A man as in the land of Uz, Job his name; and that man was blameless and upright, and fearing God, and departing from evil.
And seven sons and three daughters will be born to him.
And his possession will be seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred pair of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and service exceedingly much; and that man shall be great above all the sons of the east.
And his sons went and made a drinking in the house, a man his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
And it will be that the days of drinking went round, and Job will send and consecrate them, and he rose early in the morning and brought up burnt-offerings for the number of them all: for Job said, Perhaps my sons sinned, and blessed God in their hearts. Thus did Job all the days.
And the day will be and the sons of God will come to stand before God, and also the adversary will come in the midst of them.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, From whence wilt thou come? And the adversary will answer Jehovah, and say, From running to and fro in the earth, and from walking about in it.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Didst thou set thy heart to my servant Job? for none like him in the earth; a man blameless and upright, fearing God and departing from evil.
And the adversary will answer Jehovah and say, Did Job fear God gratuitously?
Didst thou, not hedge about him and about his house, and about all that is to him from round about? Thou didst bless the work of his hands, and his possession spread abroad in the earth.
But send forth now thy band and tough upon all which is to him, if he will not bless thee upon thy face.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Behold, all that is to him in thy hand: only upon him thou shalt not send forth thy hand. And the adversary will go forth from the face of Jehovah.
And the day will be and his sons and daughters will be eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born:
And a messenger came to Job; and he will say, The oxen were ploughing, and the he asses were feeding upon their hands.
And Sheba will fall and take them; they struck the young men by the month of the sword; and only shall escape, I alone, to announce to thee.
This one yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, The fire of God fell from the heavens, and it will burn upon the sheep and upon the young men, and it will devour them; and I shall escape, only I alone, to announce to thee.
This one yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, The Chaldeans set three heads, and they invaded upon the camels, and they will take them, and they struck the young men with the mouth of the sword; and I shall escape, only I alone, to announce to thee.
This yet speaking, and this came, and he will say, Thy sons and thy daughters Were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the first-born:
And behold, a great wind came from beyond the desert, and it will touch upon the four corners of the house, and fall upon the young men, and they will die; and I shall escape, I only, to announce to thee.
And Job will rise and rend his covering, and shave his head, and fall to the earth and worship.
And he will say, Naked I came forth from my mother's womb, and naked shall I turn back there: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah took; the name of Jehovah shall be blessed.
In all this Job sinned not, and gave not folly to God.
And the day will be and the sons of God will come to stand before Jehovah, and the adversary also will come in the midst of them to stand before Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, From whence wilt thou come? And the adversary will answer to Jehovah and say, From running to and fro in the earth, and from walking about in it.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Didst thou set thy heart to my servant Job, that none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and departing from evil? And yet he holding fast upon his integrity, and thou wilt stimulate me to destroy him without cause.
And the adversary will answer Jehovah and say, Skin for skin, and all which is to a man he will give for his soul.
But send forth now thy hand and touch upon his bone and upon his flesh, if he will not bless thee to thy face.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Behold him in thy hand, but watch his soul.
And the adversary will go forth from the face of Jehovah, and he will strike Job with an evil burning sore, from the sole of his foot even to his crown.
And he will take to him a pot sherd to scrape himself with it, and he will sit in the midst of the ashes.
And his wife will say to him, Yet thou art holding fast upon thine integrity: praise God and die.
And he will say to her, According to the word of one of the foolish women thou wilt speak. Shall we also receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this. Job sinned not with his lips.
And the three friends of Job will hear all this evil coming upon him, and they will come, a man from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: and they will appoint to come together to deplore for him, and to comfort him.
And they will lift up their eyes from far off, and they knew him not, and they will lift up their voice and weep; and they will rend each his covering, and they will sprinkle dust upon their heads to the heavens.
And they sat with him upon, the earth seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word to him: for they saw that grief was great exceedingly.
After this Job opened his mouth, and he will curse his day.
Job will answer and say,
The day shall perish I shall bring forth in it, and the night said, A male was conceived.
That day shall be darkness; God shall not search it out from above, and the light shall not shine upon it.
Darkness shall pollute it, and the shadow of death; a cloud shall dwell upon it; the obscurations of day shall terrify it.
That night darkness shall take it; it shall not be joined upon the days of the year; it shall not come into the number of months.
Behold, that night shall be hard; no rejoicing shall be in it.
They cursing the day shall curse it, they being ready to rouse up the sea monster.
The stars of its twilight shall he dark; it shall wait for light, and none; and it shall not look upon the eyelashes of the dawn.
Because it shut not up the doors of my belly; and shall it hide the labor of mine eyes?
Wherefore shall I not die from the womb? and I came forth from the belly, and I shall expire.
Why did the knees anticipate me? and wherefore the breasts that I shall suck?
For now I lay down and I shall rest; I slept: then there will be rest to me.
With kings and counselors of the earth building the wastes for themselves;
Or with chiefs, gold to them, filling their houses with silver:
Or as a hidden abortion I shall not be; as children they saw not light.
There the unjust ceased to be angry, and the weary in strength shall rest.
They being bound, rested together; they heard not the voice of the taskmaster.
The little and the great, he is there; and the servant being free from his lord.
Wherefore shall light be given to him toiling, and life to the bitter of soul?
Waiting for death, and it is not; and they will dig more than for hidden treasures;
Rejoicing with joy when they find the grave;
To a man whose way was hid, and God will hedge about him?
For my sighing will come before any bread, and my groanings shall be poured put as waters.
For I feared a fear, and it will come upon me, and what I was afraid of will come to me.
I was not secure, and I rested not, and I was not quiet; and trouble will come.
And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,
Trying the word to thee shalt thou be weary? who shall be able to with hold in speaking?
Behold, thou didst instruct many, and thou wilt strengthen the weak hands.
Thy words will raise up the weak and thou wilt strengthen the bent knees.
But now it shall come to thee and thou wilt be wearied; it will touch even to thee, and thou wilt tremble.
Is not thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?
Remember now, who perished, he being innocent? and where were the upright cut off?
According to what I saw, they ploughing iniquity and sowing labor shall reap it.
By the breath of God they shall perish, and from the spirit of his anger they shall be finished.
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lion, and the teeth of the young lions were broken.
The lion perished from failure of prey, and the sons of the lioness shall be scattered.
And a word shall be brought to me by stealth, and mine ear will take a transient sound from it.
In thoughts, from visions of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men,
Fear met me, and trembling, and caused the multitude of my bones to tremble.
And the spirit will glide before my face; the hair of my flesh will stand erect:
It will stand, and I shall not recognize its appearance: a form before mine eyes; I shall hear stillness and a voice:
Shall a man be just above God? If a man shall be pure above him making him?
Behold, in his servants he will not trust, and upon his messengers he will set folly:
Also those dwelling in houses of clay which their foundation in the dust, being crushed before the moth.
From morning to evening they will be struck; from not setting to superintend they will perish.
Did not their remainder in them remove? They will die, and not in wisdom.
Call now, if there is answering thee; and to whom from the holy ones wilt thou turn?
For to the foolish, and anger will slay, and the simple will jealousy kill.
I saw the foolish one taking root, and suddenly I shall curse his habitation.
His sons shall be far from salvation, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and none delivering.
Which his harvest the hungry one will devour, and not from thorns shall they take it, and destruction gaped after their substance.
For toil will not come forth from the dust, and labor will not spring up from the earth;
For man shall be born to labor as the sons of the flame will lift up to fly.
But I will seek to God, and to God set my cause:
He did great things, and no searching; and wonders even no number:
He gave rain upon the face of the earth, and sent waters upon the out places:
To raise up the humbled to height; and those mourning were exalted to salvation.
Bringing to nought the purposes of the crafty, and their hand shall not do an undertaking.
He took the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the perverse was headlong.
The days they will meet darkness, and they will grope in the noon day as night.
And he saved the needy from the sword, from their mouth and from the band of the strong one.
And hope will be to the poor one, and iniquity contracted her mouth.
Behold, happy the man God shall rebuke him: and thou shalt not reject the correction of the Almighty:
For he will cause pain, and he will bind up: he will smite and his hands will heal.
In six straits he will deliver thee, and in seven, evil shall not touch upon thee.
In famine he redeemed thee from death, and in war from the hands of the sword.
In the scourge of the tongue thou shalt be hid, and thou shalt not be afraid of desolation when it shall come.
At desolation and at hunger thou shalt laugh, and from the beasts of the earth thou shalt not fear.
For with the stones of the field they covenant, and the beast of the field was at peace with thee.
And thou knewest that thy tent is peace, and thou reviewedst thy dwelling, and thou shalt not sin.
And thou knewest the multitude of thy seed, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
Thou shalt come in old age to thy grave, as the ascending of a heap of sheaves in its time.
Behold this, we searched it out, so it is: hear it, and know thou for thyself.
And Job will answer and say,
I would weighing, my anger shall be weighed, and my falls shall be lifted up in the balances together.
For now it will be heavy above the sand of the seas: for this my words were rash.
For the arrows of the Almighty are with me, which their anger drank up my spirit: the terrors of God will be prepared for me.
Shall the wild ass bray at grass? if the ox will low over his provender?
Shall that unseasoned be eaten without salt? if there is taste in purslain slime?
My soul refused to touch these as the loathsomeness of my bread.
Who will give my asking shall come? and will God give my expectation?
And God will, and he will crush me; will he let his hand remain, and will he cut me off?
And it will yet be my consolation, and I shall exult in pain: he will not spare; for I hid not the words of of the Holy One.
For what my strength that I shall wait and what my end, that I shall prolong my soul?
If my strength the strength of stones? if my flesh of brass?
And if not my help in me? and deliverance fled from me?
To him melting, mercy from his friend; and he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.
My brethren dealt faithlessly as a torrent; as a channel of torrents they shall pass away;
Being darkened because of ice, upon them the snow will be hid:
In the time they will flow of they became extinct: in its heat they were extinguished from their place.
The paths of their way will turn aside; they will go up into desolation and perish.
Behold the paths of Tema; the goings of Sheba, wait ye for them.
They were ashamed for trusting; they came even to it, they will be put to shame.
For now ye were not: ye shall see the terror and be afraid.
For did I say, Give to me? and from your strength make ye a present for me?
And deliver me from the hand of the enemy? and from the hand of the strong ye shall redeem me?
each ye me, and I will be silent: and what I erred in, cause me to understand.
How forcible were words of uprightness! and what will reproving from you prove?
Will ye purpose to reprove words, and for the spirit of the words of him despairing?
But ye will cause the orphans to fall, and ye will dig for your friend.
And now be content, look upon me; and before your face if I shall lie;
Turn ye back now, it shall not be iniquity; and turn back yet, my justice is in it.
Is there iniquity in my tongue? if my palate shall not understand calamities.
Is there not warfare to man upon the earth, and his days as the days of a hireling?
As the servant will gape for the shadow, and as the hireling will wait for his work:
So was I caused to possess to me months of vanity, and nights of toil were allotted to me.
If I lay down, and I said, When shall I arise, and the evening be measured? And I was filled with tossings even to the twilight.
And my flesh was clothed with worms, and a clod of dust; my akin was contracted and melted away.
My days were swift above a weaver's shuttle, and will finish with no more of hope.
Remember that my life is wind: mine eyes shall not turn back to see good.
The eye of him seeing me shall not look after me: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
The cloud will end and will go away: thus he shall go down to hades and shall not come up.
He shall turn back no more to his house, and his place shall know him no more.
Also I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the straitness of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Am I the sea, or a dragon, that thou wilt set a watch over me?
For I said, My bed shall comfort me; my couch shall lift up in my complaint;
And thou didst terrify me with dreams, and thou wilt make me afraid with visions:
And my soul will choose strangling; death rather than my bones.
I melted away; I shall not live forever: desist from me, for my days are vanity.
What is man that thou wilt magnify him? and that thou wilt set thy heart to him?
And thou wilt review him for the mornings, and thou wilt try him for the moments.
How long wilt thou not look away from me? wilt thou not desist from me even to my swallowing down my spittle?
I sinned; what shall I do to thee, guarding men? wherefore didst thou set me for an assault to thee, and I shall be upon myself for a burden?
And why wilt thou not lift up my transgression and pass over mine iniquity? for now I shall lie down to the dust; and thou soughtest me and I was not.
And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
How long wilt thou speak these things? and the great spirit of the words of thy mouth?
Will God pervert judgment? and if the Almighty will pervert justice?
If thy sons sinned to him, and he will send them away by the hand of their transgression;
If thou shalt seek to God, if thou shalt make supplication to him;
If thou wert pure and upright, for now he will awake for thee and requite the habitation of thy justice.
And thy beginning was small, and thy latter state shall increase greatly.
For ask now to the first generation, and prepare to seek their fathers:
(For yesterday are we and we shall not know, for our days upon earth are a shadow:)
Shall they not teach thee, and say to thee, and bring forth words from their heart?
Shall the bulrush lift itself up without a marsh? shall the marsh grass grow without water?
While yet in its greenness it shall not break off, and it will dry up before grass.
So the paths of all forgetting God and the hope of the profane one shall perish.
Which his hope shall be cut off, and the spider's house his trust.
He shall lean upon his house and it shall not stand: he shall hold fast upon it, and it shall not rise up.
It was moist before the sun, and its sprout will come forth upon his garden.
His roots were entwined upon a heap, he shall see a house of stones.
If he should swallow him down from his place, and it lied upon it: I saw thee not.
Behold, this the rejoicing of his way, and from the dust shall they cause another to grow.
Behold, God will not reject the blameless one, and he will not take hold upon the hand of those doing evil:
Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with shouts of joy.
They hating thee shall put on shame; and the tent of the unjust shall not be.
And Job will answer and say,
I knew that so the truth: and how shall man be just with God?
If he shall desire to contend with him, he shall not answer him one from a thousand.
Wise of heart and strong of power: who was hard before him and shall be requited?
Removing the mountains and they knew not: who overturned them in his anger;
Moving the earth from her place, and her pillars will tremble;
Saying to the sun, and it shall not rise; and for the stars he will seal them up.
He alone spread out the heavens and he trod upon the heights of the sea.
He made Ash-Chesil and Cimah, and the chambers of the south;
He did great things even not searched out; and wonders even no number.
Behold, he will pass by me, and I shall not see: and he will glide on and I shall not understand for him.
Behold, he will catch and who shall turn him? and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?
God will not turn back his anger, the helpers of pride bowed down under him.
How much less shall I answer him, shall I choose my words with him?
Whom, if I was just, I shall not answer; I will make supplication to my judge.
If I called and he will answer me, I shall not believe that he will give ear to my voice.
Who will assail me with tempest, and he multiplied my wounds without cause.
He will not give me to draw in my spirit, for he will fill me with bitterness.
If for strength, behold him strong: if for judgment, who shall arraign me.
If I shall be just, my mouth shall condemn me: I am blameless, and he will declare me perverse.
I am blameless, I shall not know my soul: I shall despise my life.
It is one: for this, I said, The blameless one and the unjust one he finishes.
If the scourge shall fall suddenly, he will deride at the trial of the innocent.
The earth was given into the hand of the unjust one: he will cover the faces of her judges; if not now, who is it?
My days were swift above a runner: they fled, they saw not good.
They glided along with the ships of desire: as the eagle will pounce upon food.
If my saying, I will forget my complaint, I will let go my face, and I will be cheerful:
I was afraid of all my pains, I knew that thou wilt not acquit me.
Shall I do evil, wherefore this shall I labor in vain?
If I washed myself in snow-water, and cleansed my hands clean;
Then thou wilt immerse me in the ditch, and my garments abhorred me.
For not a man as I; I shall answer him, we shall come together in judgment.
There is not between us a reprover; he will put his hand upon us two.
He will take away his rod from me, and his truth shall not make me afraid.
I will speak, and I shall not fear him; but not so am I with myself.
My soul was weary in my life; I shall leave upon me my complaint; I shall speak in the bitterness of my soul.
Saying to God, Thou wilt not condemn me; make known to me for what thou wilt contend with me.
Is it good to thee that thou wilt oppress, that thou wilt despise the labor of thy hinds, and thou didst shine upon the counsels of the unjust?
Were eyes of flesh to thee? or wilt thou see as man saw?
Are thy days as man's days? or thy years as the days of man?
That thou wilt seek for mine iniquity, and wilt search out for my sins?
Upon thy knowledge that I will not do evil; and none delivering from thy hand.
Thy hands formed me, and they will work me together round about; and thou wilt swallow me down.
Remember now, thou didst make me as day; and thou wilt turn me back to dust.
Wilt thou not weigh me out as milk, and coagulate me as cheese?
Thou wilt clothe me with skin and flesh, and thou wilt hedge me with bones and sinews.
Thou didst with me life and mercy, and thy reviewing watched my spirit.
And these thou didst hide in thy heart: I knew that this is with thee.
If I sinned; and thou didst watch me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
If I did evil, wo to me; and was I just, I shall not lift up my head, being filled with dishonor: and see thou mine affliction;
And shall it be lifted up? Thou wilt hunt me as the lion, and thou wilt turn back, thou wilt show thyself wonderful upon me.
Thou wilt renew thy testimonies before me, and thou wilt increase thy wrath upon me; changes and war with me.
And wherefore didst thou bring Me forth from the belly? I shall expire, and eye shall not see me.
I shall be as I was not; I shall be brought from the womb to the grave.
Is it not my days few? He will cease; he will turn from me, and I shall be cheerful a little,
Before I shall go and turn back to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
A land of darkness, as thick darkness; of the shadow of death, and not orders, and the brightness, as thick darkness.
And Zophar the Naamathite will answer and say,
Shall not the multitude of words be answered? and shall a man of lips be justified?
Shall thy empty talks cause men to be silent? and wilt thou deride and none making ashamed?
And thou wilt say, My instruction is pure, and I was clean in thine eyes.
And who Will give God speaking, and he will open his lips with thee?
And he shall announce to thee hidden things of wisdom, for they are the double for understanding. And know thou that God will set to thee from thine iniquity.
Searching shalt thou and God? Shalt thou find the Almighty even to completeness?
The heavens being high, what wilt thou do? Hades being deep, what wilt thou know?
Its measure long above the earth, and broad above the sea.
If he shall pass on, and shut up, and gather together, who shall turn him back.
For he knew men of vanity, and he will see iniquity; and will he not understand?
And man being empty will be without heart: and man will be born a wild ass's colt.
If thou preparedst thy heart, and didst spread thy hands towards him;
If iniquity in thy hand, remove it far off, and wickedness shall not dwell in thy tents.
For then thou shalt lift up thy face from spot; and thou wert firm, and thou shalt not fear:
For thou shalt forget toil, then shalt remember as waters they passed away.
And life shall rise above the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
And thou didst trust, for there is hope; and thou didst search out; thou shalt lie down confidently.
And thou shalt lie down and none terrifying; and many waited for thy face.
And the eyes of the unjust shall be consumed, and flight shall perish from them, and their hope a breathing out of the soul.
And Job will answer and say,
Verily that ye are the people, and shall wisdom die with you?
Also to me a heart like you; I fall not more than you: and with whom not like these?
I shall be he laughing at his neighbor, calling to God, and he will answer him: the just blameless one being laughed at.
To misfortune is contempt to the thoughts of him at ease, being prepared for the waverings of the foot.
The tents to those oppressing will be secure, and confidence to those provoking God to anger: whom God will bring into his hand.
But ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee; and the birds of the heavens, and they shall announce to thee:
Or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall recount to thee.
Who knew not in all these that the hand of God did this?
Which in his hand the soul of all living, and the spirit of all the flesh of man.
Shall not the ear try words? and the palate shall taste food to it?
With old men is wisdom, and length of days, understanding.
With him wisdom and strength, to him counsel and understanding.
Behold, he will pull down and it shall not be built up: he will shut up against man and it shall not be opened.
Behold, he will hold back upon the waters, and they will dry up: and he will send them forth and they will overturn the earth.
With him strength and purpose: to him the one led astray and him leading astray.
Leading away counselors stripped off and he will make foolish the judges.
He loosed the bonds of kings, and he will gird upon their loins a girdle.
Leading away priests stripped off, and he will overthrow the mighty.
Removing the lip to the faithful, and he will take discernment of old men.
Proving contempt upon nobles, and he slackened the girdle of the strong.
Revealing deep things from darkness, and he will bring to light the shadow of death.
Making great to the nations, and he will destroy them: he spread out to the nations, and he will guide them.
Taking away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth, and he will cause them to wander in a waste, not a way.
They will feel darkness and not light, and he will cause them to wander as one intoxicated.
Behold all mine eye saw, and mine ear heard, and it will understand for it.
According to your knowledge I knew also: I fall not more than you.
But I will speak to the Almighty; I shall delight to plead before God.
And on the contrary, ye devise falsehood; physicians all of you for nothing.
Who will give silence? Ye shall be silent, and it shall be to you for wisdom.
Hear now my proof, and attend to the pleadings of my lips.
Will ye speak wickedness for God? and will ye speak deceit to him?
Will ye accept his face? will ye contend for God?
Is it good that he shall search you out? or as he mocking against a man; will ye mock against him?
Reproving, he will reprove you if in secret ye lift up faces.
Shall not his majesty make you afraid? and his terror fall upon you?
Your remembrances being likened to ashes, your backs to backs of clay.
Be silent from me and I will speak what shall pass upon me.
For what shall I lift up my flesh in my teeth, and shall I put my soul in my hand?
If he shall slay me shall I not hope? only I will prove my ways to his face.
Also he is to me for salvation for a profane one shall not come before him.
Hearing, hear ye my words, and my declaration in your ears.
Behold now I set in order judgment; I knew that I shall be justified.
Who is he will contend with me? for now shall I be silent and expire;
Only two things thou wilt not do with me: then I shall not hide from thy face.
Remove thy hand far from me, and thy terror shall not make me afraid.
And call and I will answer, and I shall speak, and turn thou to me.
How many iniquities and sins to me? make known to me my transgression and my sin.
Why wilt thou hide thy face, and reckon me for an enemy to thee?
Wilt thou terrify the scattered leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry straw?
For thou wilt write bitter things against me; and thou wilt give me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.
And thou wilt set my feet in the stocks, and thou wilt watch all my paths; thou wilt dig round the roots of my feet.
And he as rottenness will fall away; as a garment the moth ate it.
Man being born of woman is short of days and full of disquiet.
And as a flower he will come forth, and will be cut down: and he will flee as a shadow, and shall not stand.
Also upon this one didst thou open thine eyes? and wilt thou bring Me into judgment with thee?
For who shall give a clean thing from an unclean? Not one.
If his days are determined, the number of his months with thee; thou madest his limit; he shall not pass over.
Look away from him and be shall cease, till he shall delight as an hireling in his day.
For there is hope for a tree if it shall be cut down, and it shall yet revive, and its suckers shall not cease.
If its root shall grow old in the earth, and its trunk shall die in the dust.
From the smell of water it will break forth, and make foliage as a plant.
And man will die and be weak: and man will expire, and where is he?
The waters departed from the sea, and the river will be wasted and dried up;
And man lay down and he will not rise: till the heavens be no more they shall not awake and rise from their sleep.
Who will give thou wilt hide me in hades? wilt thou cover me till the turning away of thine anger? wilt thou set for me a limit, and wilt thou remember me?
If a man die, shall he live? All the days of my warfare I will wait till the coming of my change.
Thou shalt call and I will answer thee: thou wilt long for the work of thy hands.
For now thou wilt count my steps: wilt thou not watch over my sin?
My transgression is sealed up in a purse, and thou wilt patch upon mine iniquity.
And yet the mountain falling shill decay, and the rock shall be removed from its place.
The waters rubbed the stones: thou wilt overflow the flowings of the dust of the earth; and thou didst destroy the hope of man.
Thou wilt overpower him forever, and he will go away: changing his face, thou wilt send him away.
His sons will be honored and he knew not: they will be brought low, and he will not understand for them.
But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul upon him shall mourn.
And Eli-Phaz the Temanite will answer and say,
Shall a wise one answer knowledge of wind, and fill his belly with the east wind?
Reproving with words he shall not profit, and speeches will be of no use in them.
Also thou wilt bring to nought, fear, and thou wilt withhold meditation before God.
For thy mouth will accustom itself to thine iniquity, and thou wilt choose the tongue of the crafty.
Thy mouth will condemn thee, and not I: and thy lips will testify against thee.
Shalt thou be the firm man born? and hadst thou a beginning before the hills?
Shalt thou hear in the consultation of God? and wilt thou reserve wisdom to thyself?
What knewest thou and we shall not know? wilt thou understand and it not be with us?
Also the gray headed and old man with us, great of days above thy fathers.
Is it small with thee the consolations of God? and a word covered with thee?
Why shall thy heart take thee? and why shall thine eyes wink?
That thou wilt turn thy spirit against God, and thou broughtest words from thy mouth?
What is man that he will be clean? and that he will be just, being born of woman?
Behold, in his holy ones he will, not trust; and the heavens were not clean in his eyes.
How much more abominable and corrupt is man drinking iniquity as water!
I will show thee, hear to me; and that I saw I will recount;
Which the wise ones will announce, and he hid it not from their fathers.
To them alone the earth was given, and a stranger passed not in the midst of them.
All the days the unjust one himself being pained, and numbering the years they were hidden to him terrifying.
The voice of fears in his ears: in peace he destroying shall come upon him.
He will not believe to turn back from darkness, and he was waited for by the sword.
He wandered about for bread, where he knew that the day of darkness was ready at his hand.
Straitness and distress shall terrify him; they shall overpower him as a king ready for war.
For he stretched forth his hand against God, and he will strengthen himself against the Almighty.
He will run against him upon the neck, upon the thicknesses of his shields:
For he covered his face with his fat, and he will make fatness upon the flank.
And he will dwell in cities out off, the houses shall not be inhabited by them, which were ready for heaps.
He shall not be rich, and his wealth shall not rise up; their possession shall not extend upon the earth.
He shall not depart from darkness; the flame shall dry up his suckers, and by the breath of his mouth shall he depart.
He being deceived shall not trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his compensation.
Before his day it shall be completed, and his branch was not green.
He will shake off as a vine his unripe grapes, and he will cast his flower as the olive.
For the assembly of the profane is hard, and fire consumed the tents of the gift.
He conceiving trouble and he bringing forth vanity, and their belly shall prepare deceit.
And Job will answer and say,
I heard many like there: comforters of vexation ye all.
Was there an end to words of wind? or what will provoke thee that thou wilt answer?
Also I will speak as you: if it is your soul instead of my soul, I will join together with words against you, and shake my head against you upon it.
I will strengthen you with my month, the moving of my lips shall hold back.
If I shall speak, my pain will not be held back, and shall I cease, what will go from me?
But now he made me weary: thou hast made desolate all mine assembly.
Thou wilt lay fast hold on me to be for a testimony, and my leanness will rise up in me; it will answer against my face.
He rent in his anger, and he will lie in wait for me, gnashing upon me with his teeth; mine enemy will sharpen his eyes against me.
They gaped upon me with their mouth; with reproach they struck upon my cheek; they will fill out together against me.
God will shut me up to the evil one, and he will cast me into the hands of the unjust.
I was secure, and he will break me in pieces: and he seized upon my neck and he will disperse me, and he will set me up to him for a mark:
His multitudes will surround upon me, he will cleave my reins asunder, and not spare; he will pour my gall upon the earth.
He will break me, breaking upon the face of breaking; he will run upon me as the strong one.
I sewed together sackcloth upon my skin, and I thrust my horn into the dust.
My face became red from weeping, and upon my eye-lashes the shadow of death.
Not for violence in my hands: and my prayer is clean.
O earth, thou wilt not cover my blood; and shall there not be place for my cry?
Also now, behold, my witness in the heavens, and my testimony in the heights.
My friends mocking me: to God mine eye wept.
Shall he judge for a man with God? and the son of man for his neighbor?
When years of number shall come, and the way I shall go I shall not turn back.
My spirit being destroyed my days were extinct; the graves are for me.
If not mockings with me? and shall not mine eye lodge in their bitterness?
Set up now, pledge me with thee: who is he will strike for my hand?
For thou didst hide their heart from understanding; for this thou wilt not exalt them.
He will commence evils for a position, and the eyes of his sons shall be consumed.
He set me for a parable of the peoples, and I shall be one spit upon to the face.
And mine eye shall be weak from vexation, and my thoughts as a shadow all of them.
The upright shall be astonished upon this, and the innocent Shall arouse himself against the profane.
And the just shall hold on his way, and the clean one of hands shall add strength.
But ye all shall turn back, and come ye now, and I shall not find a wise one among you.
My days passed away, my purposes were broken; the possessions of my heart.
They will set the night for day: the light being near from the face of darkness.
If I shall wait, hades is my house: in darkness I spread my bed.
I called to the pit: Grave, thou my father: and to the worm, My mother, and my sister.
And where now my hope? and my hope who shall regard it?
They shall go down to the bars of hades if together we shall go down to the dust.
And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
How long will ye set an end to words? Ye shall understand, and afterwards we will speak.
Wherefore were we reckoned as cattle, and were unclean in your eyes?
He rent his soul in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed from its place?
Also the light of the unjust shall be extinguished, and the flame of his fire shall not shine;
The light was darkened in his tent, and his lamp shall be extinguished for him.
The steps of his strength shall be straightened, and his counsel shall cast him down.
For he was cast into a net by his feet, and he will go about upon latticework.
A snare shall lay hold upon the heel, the noose shall hold fast upon him.
His gin being hid in the earth, and his snare upon the beaten path.
Terrors made him afraid round about, and scattered him to his feet.
His strength shall be hunger, and destruction being prepared at his side.
It shall devour the bars of his skin: the first-born of death shall devour his bars.
His confidence shall be plucked out from his tent, and it shall drive him to the king of terrors.
It shall dwell in his tent, from not to him: brimstone shall be scattered upon his dwelling.
From underneath, his roots shall be dried up, and from above, his harvest shall be cut off.
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and not a name to him upon a face without.
They shall drive him out of light into darkness, and they shall exclude him from the habitable globe.
No offspring to him, and no progeny among his people, and not a survivor in his dwellings.
Others were astonished at his day, and the ancient took hold on shuddering.
Also these the dwellings of evil, and this the place of him not knowing God.
And Job will answer and say,
How long will ye, grieve my soul, and crush me with words?
These ten times ye will reproach me: ye will not be ashamed, ye will injure me.
If indeed I erred my error will lodge with me.
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and prove against me my reproach:
Know ye now that God subverted me; and he folded his net about me.
Behold, I shall cry violence, and shall I not be answered: I shall cry for help, and no judgment.
He walled up my path and I shall not pass, and he will set darkness upon my beaten paths.
And he put off from me my honor, and he removed the crown of my head.
He will lay me waste round about, and I shall go: and he will remove my hope as a tree.
And he will kindle his anger against me, and he will reckon me to him as his enemy.
His troops shall come together and raise up their way against me, and they will encamp round about to my tent.
He removed my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance truly turned aside from me.
My kindred ceased, and they acquainted with me forgot me.
They sojourning in my house and my maids, mill reckon me for a stranger: I was a foreigner in their eyes.
I called to my servant and he will not answer; I shall entreat him with my mouth.
My spirit was loathsome to my wife, and I entreated to the sons of my belly.
Also children rejected me; I shall arise, and they will speak against me.
All the men of my intimacy will abhor me, and those I loved were turned against me.
My bone cleaved to my skin and to my flesh, and I shall escape with the skin of my teeth.
Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, for the hand of God touched upon me.
Why will ye pursue me as God, and will ye not be satisfied from my flesh?
Who will give now, and my words shall be written? who will give and they shall be delineated in a book?
They shall be cut in the rock with a style of iron and lead, forever.
And I knew he redeeming me lived, and at last he shall rise up upon the dust:
And after they destroyed my skin, this, and from my flesh I shall see God:
Which I shall see for myself, and mine eyes beheld, and not a stranger: my reins were finished in my bosom.
For ye shall say, Why shall we pursue after him and the root of the word was found in me?
And fear ye to yourselves, from the face of the sword? for wrath the iniquities of the sword, so that ye shall know there is judgment.
And the Naainathite will answer and say,
For this my thoughts will turn back, and because of my haste in me.
I shall hear the instruction of my shame, and the spirit of my understanding will cause me to answer.
Thou knewest this from everlasting when man was set upon the earth:
For the rejoicing of the unjust drawing near, and the gladness of the profane even for a moment.
If his elevation shall go up to the heavens, and his head shall reach to the cloud;
As his dung he shall perish forever: they seeing him shall say, Where is he?
As a dream he shall fly away, and they shall not find him: and he shall flee away as the vision of the night.
The eye scanned him and shall not add; and his place shall no more look after him.
The weak shall break his sons, and his hands shall turn back his wealth.
His bones were full of his youth, and shall lie down with him in the dust.
If evil shall be sweet in his mouth he will cover it under his tongue;
He will spare over it, and forsake it not, and keep it back in the midst of his palate:
His bread in his bowels was turned, the gall of asps in his midst.
He swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit it up, and God shall drive it out of his belly.
He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall kill him.
He shall not look upon the streams, the rivers, the torrents of honey and curdled milk.
Turning back the labor, and he shall not swallow down: according to the substance of his exchange and he shall not exult.
For he oppressed, forsaking the poor; he stripped the house and he will not build it up.
For he knew not tranquillity in his belly, in his desire he shall not escape.
Nothing was left to his food; for this his good shall not be stable.
In the fulness of his abundance it shall be pressed to him: every laboring hand shall come to him.
He will be for filling his belly, he will send upon him the burning of his anger, and will rain upon him in his eating.
He shall flee from the weapon of iron, the bow of brass shall pierce him.
Being drawn it will come forth from the body; and the lightning will go from his bile, and terrors upon him.
All darkness hid for his secret places: a fire not blown upon shall devour him; and the remaining one shall do evil upon his tent.
The heavens shall uncover his iniquity, and the earth an adversary against him.
The increase of his house shall be rolled off; they were poured out in the day of his anger.
This the portion of an unjust man and the lot of his command from God.
And Job will answer and say,
Hearing, hear ye my speech, and this shall be your consolations.
Suffer me and I will speak; and after my word ye will mock.
I, is my complaint to man? and then wherefore shall not my spirit be shortened?
Look to me and be astonished, and put the hand upon the mouth.
And when I remembered and trembled, and horror took hold of my flesh.
Wherefore shall the unjust live? They grew old, also they were strong in power.
Their seed was established before their face with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
Their houses peace from fear, and the rod of God not upon them.
His ox passed over and will not be cast away: his heifer will escape and will not be barren.
They will send forth their children as a flock, and their children will leap.
They will lift up with the drum and harp, and they will rejoice at the voice of the pipe.
Their days glided on in good, and in a moment they will lay hold of hades.
And they will say to God, Depart from us; and we desired not the knowledge of thy ways.
What the Almighty that we shall serve him? and what shall we be profited if we shall supplicate to him?
Behold, their good not in the hand: the counsel of the unjust was far from me.
How often the light of the unjust shall be extinguished, and their destruction will come upon them. He will distribute pains in his anger.
They shall be as straw before the wind, and as chaff the storm stole it away.
God will lay up his iniquity for his sons: he will requite to him and be shall know.
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink from the wrath of the Almighty.
For what his delight in his house after him, and the number of? his months were divided out?
Shall he teach knowledge to God? and he will judge those lifted up.
This shall die in the strength of his fulness, altogether tranquil and at rest.
His sides were filled with fat, and the marrow of his bones will, be moistened.
And this will die in the soul of bitterness, and will not eat in good.
They will lie down together upon the dust, and the worm shall cover over them.
Behold, I knew your purposes, and the devices ye will shake off against me.
For ye will say, Where the house of the noble one; and where the tent of the dwellings of the unjust?
Did ye not ask them passing over the way? and shall ye not know their signs?
For the evil one will be spared for the day of destruction; they shalt be led away to the day of wraths.
Who shall announce his way upon his face? and who shall requite to him that he did?
And he shall be led away to the graves, and shall watch over the tomb.
And the clods of the valley were sweet to him, and every man shall draw after him, and before him no number.
And how will ye comfort me in vain, and your answers remained treachery?
And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,
Shall a man profit to God as he understanding shall profit for himself?
Did it please to the Almighty that thou wilt be just? and if gain if thou wilt perfect thy ways?
Will he reprove thee from thy fear? Will he go with thee into judgment?
Is not thine evil much? and no end to thine iniquities?
For thou wilt take a pledge of thy brethren, in vain, and the garments of the naked thou wilt strip of.
Thou wilt not give to the weary one water to drink, and from the hungry one thou wilt withhold bread.
And the man of arm, to him the earth; and the lifted up of face dwelt in it.
Thou didst send away widows empty, and the arms of the orphans will be broken.
For this, snares are round about thee, and sudden fear will terrify thee;
Or darkness thou wilt not see; and abundance of waters shall cover thee.
Is not God high in the heavens? and see the head of the stars for they were lifted up.
And thou saidst How shall God know? Shall he judge in the cloud of darkness?
Clouds a covering to him, and he will not see; and he will go about the circle of the heavens.
Wilt thou watch the path of old which men of iniquity trod?
Who were laid hold of, and no time a river will pour out their foundation?
They saying to God, Depart from us: and what shall the Almighty do for them?
And he filled their houses with good: and the counsel of the unjust was far from me.
The just shall see and shall be glad: and the innocent shall deride at them.
If our adversaries were not destroyed, and their remnant the fire shall devour.
Be acquainted now with him, and be safe: by them shall good come to thee.
Take now the law from his mouth, and set his words in thy heart.
If thou wilt turn back even to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt remove iniquity far off from thy tent.
Place thou gold upon the dust, and the precious ore of the torrents of Ophir.
And the Almighty was thy gold and silver of labors to thee.
For then upon the Almighty shalt thou delight thyself, and thou shalt lift up thy face to God.
And thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt repay thy vows.
And thou shalt decide the word, and it shall be set up to thee: and the light shone upon thy ways.
For they were humbled, and thou wilt say, A lifting up; and he will save him depressed of eyes.
He will deliver the island of the innocent: and it was delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
And Job will answer and say,
Also today is my complaint bitter: my hand heavy over my groaning,
Who will give, I knew to find him: I will come even to his place.
I will arrange judgment before him, and I will fill the mouth with proofs.
I shall know the words he will answer me, and I shall understand what he will say to me.
Will he contend with me in great power? No; but he will put in me.
There the upright one disputed with him; and I shall be delivered forever from my judge.
Behold, I shall go before, and he is not; and behind, I shall not understand for him.
The left hand in his working, and I shall not behold: he will cover himself on the right hand, and I shall not see.
For he knew the way with me: he tried me; I shall come forth as gold.
My foot laid hold upon his going, I watched his way and not softly.
From the command of his lips and I will not waver; from his law I hid the words of his mouth.
And he is in one, and who shall turn him back? and his soul desired, and he will do.
For he will finish my appointing: and many such with him.
For this I shall tremble from his face: I shall consider, and I shall be afraid of him.
God relaxed my heart, and the Almighty caused me to tremble.
For I was not cut off from the face of darkness, and he covered misfortune from my face.
Wherefore were not times hidden from the Almighty? and they knowing him saw not his days.
They will remove the bound; they will strip off the flock, and they will feed.
They will lead away the ass of the orphans, and they will take for pledge, the widow's ox.
They will turn the needy from the Way: the poor of the earth hid themselves together.
Behold, wild asses in the desert will go forth in their work, seeking for prey: the sterile region bread for him, and for the young.
In the field they will harvest his meslin, and they will glean the vintage of the unjust one.
They will cause the naked to lodge without clothing, and no covering in the cold.
They will be wet from the pouring rains of the mountains, and they embraced the rock from no shelter.
They will strip the orphan from the breast, and take a pledge for the poor.
They caused the naked to go without clothing, and from the hungry they took away the sheaf;
Between their walls they will press out oil; they trod their wine-presses, and they will thirst.
From the city men will groan, and the soul of the wounded will cry out: and God will not set folly.
They were among the rebels of light; they knew not his ways, and they dwelt not in his beaten paths.
The murderer will rise by light; he will kill the poor and needy; and in the night he will be as a thief.
And the eye of the adulterer watched the twilight, saying, Eye shall not perceive me: and secretly he will set the face.
To break through houses in darkness in the day they shut up for themselves: they knew not light.
For the morning altogether to them the shadow of death: if it shall be known, the terrors of the shadow of death.
He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion will be cursed in the earth: he will not see the way of the vineyards.
Dryness, also heat, will strip the snow waters: hades him sinning.
The womb shall forget him; the worm sucked him; he shall be no more remembered: and iniquity shall be broken as a tree.
He did evil to the barren; she will not bear: and he will not do good to the widow.
And he drew the mighty in his power: he will rise up and none shall be sure in living.
It will he given to him for confidence, and he will rest upon: and his eyes upon their ways.
They were lifted up a little while, and they are not, and they were brought low; as all they will be drawn together, and as the head of an ear of grain they shall be cut off.
And if not now, who will cause me to lie, and set my words for nought?
And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
Dominion and fear with him; he made peace in his heights.
Is there a number to his troops? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
And how shall man be justified with God? and how shall he born of woman be clean?
Behold even to the moon, and it shall not shine; and the stars were not clean in his eyes.
How much less man, a worm; and the son of man, a worm.
And Job will answer and say,
How didst thou help to him of no strength? didst thou save the arm of no strength?
How didst thou counsel to him of no wisdom? and didst thou make known help for abundance?
And with whom didst thou announce words? and whose breath came forth from thee?
The shades shall tremble from under the waters, and their inhabitants.
Hades is naked before him, and no covering to destruction.
He stretched out the north upon emptiness, he hung up the earth upon nothing.
He bound up the waters in his clouds, and the cloud was not rent under them.
Holding fast the face of the throne, he spread his cloud upon it.
He marked out with a compass the law upon the face of the waters, even till the end of light with darkness.
The pillars of the heavens shall be shaken, and be astonished from his reproof.
By his power he caused the sea to tremble; by his understanding he smote through pride.
By his spirit he polished the heavens; his hand pierced the flat serpent.
Behold these the ends of his ways; how transient a sound of the word was heard in him! and the thunder of his might who shall understand?
And Job will add to take up his parable, and say,
God lives, he removed my judgment; and the Almighty embittered my soul;
For all the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God in my nose;
If my lips shall speak iniquity, and my tongue if it shall murmur deceit.
Far be it to me if I shall justify you: till I expire I will not remove my integrity from me.
My justice I held fast, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach from my days.
Mine enemy shall be as the unjust one, and he rising up against me, as the evil one.
For what the hope of the profane one if he shall plunder? for God shall draw out his soul.
Will God hear his cry when straits shall come upon him?
If he will delight himself upon the Almighty? will he call upon God in all time?
I will teach you by the hand of God: what is with the Almighty I will not hide.
Behold, all ye yourselves saw; and wherefore this, will ye breathe out vanity?
This the portion of an unjust man with God, and the inheritance of the terrible they shall take from the Almighty.
If his sons shall be multiplied, for then the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
His surviving one shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.
If he shall heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as clay;
He shall prepare, and the just shall put on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
He built his house as the moth, and as a booth he watching made.
The rich one shall lie down, and he shall not be gathered: he opened his eyes, and he is not.
Terrors shall hedge him about as waters, the night a tempest stole him away.
The east wind shall lift him up, and he shall go: and it shall sweep him away in storm from his place.
For he shall cast upon him and not spare: fleeing, he will flee from his hand.
It shall be clapped upon him with their hands, and it shall be hissed upon him from his place.
For there is a going forth for silver, and a place for gold they will purify it.
Iron shall be taken from the dust, and stone will pour out brass.
He set an end to darkness, and he searched out for all completeness: the stone of darkness and the shadow of death.
The torrent broke out from the sojourner; being forgotten of the foot, they were weak, they wandered from men.
The earth, from it will come forth bread, and under it was turned as fire.
Its stones the place of the sapphire, and dust gold to it.
A beaten path the birds knew not, and the vulture's eye scanned it not:
The sons of pride trod it not, and the lion passed not by upon it.
He stretched forth his hand upon the flint; he overturned the mountains from the roots.
He cut rivers in the rocks, and his eye saw every precious thing.
He bound the rivers from weeping, and he will bring forth the hidden thing to light.
And from whence shall wisdom be found? and where this place of understanding?
And man knew not its estimation, and it shall not be found in the land of the living.
The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, Not with me.
Shut up gold shall not be given for it, and silver shall not be weighed its price.
It shall not be weighed with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, and the sapphire.
Gold and crystal shall not compare with it, and its exchange, vessels of pure gold.
High things, and crystal, shall not be remembered: and the drawing out of wisdom above pearls.
The topaz of Cush shall not compare with it; with pure gold it shall not be weighed.
And from whence shall wisdom come? and where this place of understanding?
And being hid from the eyes of all living, and covered from the birds of the heavens.
Destruction and death said, We heard its report with our ears:
God understood its way, and he knew its place.
For he will look to the ends of the earth, he will see under all the heavens;
To make the weight for the wind; and he weighed the waters by measure.
In his making a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the voices.
Then he saw, and he will recount it; he prepared it, and also he searched it out.
And he will say to man, Behold, the fear of Jehovah, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
And Job will add to lift up his parable, and say,
Who will give me as the months of old, as the days God will watch me?
In his causing his light to shine upon my head, before his light I shall go through darkness;
As I was in the days of my ripeness, in the intercourse of God upon my tent;
In the Almighty being yet with me, my youths round about me;
In washing my goings with butter, and the rock will pour out with me streams of oil;
In my going forth to the gate upon the city, in the street I shall prepare my seat.
The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the old men rose up and stood.
Chiefs held back in words, and they will put the hand to the mouth.
The voice the leaders hid, and their tongue was joined to their palate.
If the ear heard, and it will pronounce me happy; and the eye saw, and it will testify to me:
For I shall deliver the poor crying, and the orphan, and none helping to him.
The praise of him perishing will come upon me, and I shall cause the heart of the widow to rejoice.
I put on justice and it will clothe me: my judgment as an upper garment and a turban.
Eyes was I to the blind one, and feet to the lame was I.
I was a father to the needy, and the contention I knew not I shall search it out.
And I shall break the biter's teeth of the evil one, and I shall cast the prey from his teeth.
And saying, I shall expire with my nest I shall multiply days as the sand.
My root opened to the waters, and the dew will lodge upon my foliage.
My glory new with me, and my bow will be changed in my hand.
To me they heard, and they waited, and they will be silent for them at my counsel.
After my words they will not repeat, and my speech will drop upon them.
And they waited for me as the rain, and they opened wide their mouth for the latter rain.
I shall laugh at them, they will not believe; and the light of my face they will not cast down.
I shall choose their way, and I shall sit the head, and I shall dwell as king in the troop, as he shall comfort those mourning.
And now the younger than I laughed upon me, which I rejected their fathers to set with the dogs of my flock.
Also the strength of their hands wherefore to me? Upon them old age perished.
In want and in hunger, barren, gnawing the dry land, yesternight desolation and burning.
Plucking off sea purslain upon the shrub, the root of broom their bread.
They shall be driven forth from the midst, they shall cry after them as a thief:
To dwell in the horror of the valleys, holes of the dust, and the rocks.
Between the shrubs they will bray; they will be poured out under the thorn bush.
The sons of the foolish one, also the sons of no name: they were beaten from the land.
And now I was their song, and I to them for a by word.
They abhorred me, they removed far from me, and withheld not spittle from my face.
Because he loosed his cord and he will afflict me, and they cast off the bridle from before me.
Upon the right the brood will rise up; they cast away my feet, and they will cast up the paths of their destruction against me.
They tore up my beaten path, they helped for my fall, no help to them.
They will come as a wide breach under a destroying tempest, they rolled themselves.
Terror turned upon me, it will pursue my willingness as the wind, and my salvation passed away as a cloud.
And now my soul shall be poured out upon me; and the days of affliction will hold me fast.
The night my bones pierced from above me, and my gnawers will not lie down.
By the multitude of power my clothing will be disguised: it will gird me about as the mouth of my coat.
He cast me to the clay; I shall become like as dust and ashes.
I shall cry to thee and thou wilt not answer me: I stood up and thou wilt not attend to me.
Thou wilt turn to be cruel to me: with the strength of thy hand thou wilt lie in wait for me.
Thou wilt lift me up to the wind; thou wilt cause me to ride, and thou wilt melt to me counsel.
For I knew thou wilt turn me back to death, and the house appointed to all living.
But prayer is nothing; he will send forth the hand, if in his calamity to them a cry for help.
If I wept not for him being hard of day: my soul was grieved for the needy.
For I hoped for good and evil will come: and I shall wait for light and darkness will come.
My bowels boiled, and were not silent: the days of affliction anticipated me.
I went darkened without warmth: I rose up, I shall cry in the convocation.
I was a brother to jackals, and a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.
My skin was black from above me, and my bones burnt from heat.
And my harp will be for mourning, and my pipe for the voice of those weeping.
I cut out a covenant for mine eyes; and why shall I show myself attentive to a virgin?
And what the portion of God from above? and the inheritance of the Almighty from the heights?
Is not destruction to the evil one? and strangeness to those working iniquity?
Will he not see my way, and number all my steps?
If I went with vanity, and my foot will haste upon deceit;
He shall weigh me in balances of justice, and God will know mine integrity.
If my going will incline from the way, and my heart went after mine eyes, and a blemish did cleave upon my hands:
I will sow and another shall eat; and my offspring shall be rooted up.
If my heart was seduced by woman, and I laid wait at the door of my neighbor;
My wife shall grind for another, and others shall bow down upon her.
For this is crime, and this is iniquity for the judges.
For it is a fire; it will devour even to destruction, and will root out upon all mine increase.
If I shall despise the judgment of my servant and my maid in their contending with me;
And what shall I do when God shall rise up? And when he shall review, what shall I turn back to him?
Did not he making me in the womb, make him? And he will prepare us in one belly.
If I shall withhold from the desire of the poor, and cause the eyes of the widow to fail;
And eating my morsel alone, and the orphan ate not from it;
(For from my youth he grew up to me as a father, and I shall guide her from my mother's womb;)
If I shall see one perishing from not being clothed, and no covering to the needy;
If his loins did not praise me, and he will be warmed from the fleece of my sheep.
If I lifted up my hand against the orphan when I shall see, my help in the gate:
My shoulder shall fall from its shoulder-blade, and mine, arm shall be broken from the bone.
For the destruction of God is a terror to me, and from his lifting up I shall not prevail.
If I set gold my hope, and said to gold, My trust;
If I shall rejoice because of the Multitude of my riches, and because my hand found much;
If I shall see the light when it shall shine, and the moon going in splendor;
And my heart will be seduced in secret, and my hand shall kiss to my mouth:
Also this an iniquity for the judges: for I lied to God from above.
If I shall rejoice in the destruction of him hating me, and I exalted when evil found him:
And I gave not my palate to sin to ask in cursing his soul.
If the men of my tent said not, Who will give from his flesh? We shall not be satisfied.
The stranger shall not lodge without: I shall open my doors to the traveler.
If I covered my transgression, as man, to hide mine iniquity in my bosom:
If I, shall fear a great multitude, and the contempt of families terrify me, and I will be silent and not go out of my door.
Who will give to me hearing to me? Behold, my sign, the Almighty will answer me, and the man contending with me wrote a book.
If not, I shall lift it up upon my shoulder, I will bind it a crown to me.
The number of my steps I shall announce to him: as a leader I shall draw near to him.
If my land shall cry against me, and its, furrows shall weep together;
If I ate its strength without silver, and caused its possessors to expire:
The thorn shall come forth, instead of wheat, and the weed instead of barley. The words of Job were completed.
And these three men will cease from answering Job, for he is just in his eyes.
And the anger of Elihu will kindle, son of Barachel the Buzite, from the family of Ram: against Job was, his anger kindled, for his justifying his soul above God.
And against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they, found not an answer, and they will condemn Job.
And Elihu waited for Job in words, for they were old for days above him.
And Elihu will see that not an Answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger will kindle,
And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite will answer and say, I few for days, and ye old men; for this I was afraid, and I shall fear showing you my knowledge.
I said, days shall speak, and multitude of years shall make known wisdom.
But it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty will cause them to understand.
Not the many will be wise: and old men understand judgment.
For this, I said, Hear to me; I also will show my knowledge.
Behold, I waited for your words, giving ear even to your understandings while ye will search out words.
And I will show myself attentive even to you, and behold, none from you confuting to Job, answering his words.
Lest ye shall say, We found wisdom: God will thrust him, not man.
And he arranged not words against me: and I will not turn back to him with your words.
They were confounded; they answered no more: they removed words from themselves.
And I waited, (for they will not speak, for they stood, they answered no more:)
I also will answer my part, I also will show my knowledge.
For I was filled with words, the spirit of my belly pressed upon me.
Behold, my belly as wine it will not open; it will break open as new wine skins.
I will speak, and it will breathe to me: I will open my lips and answer.
Not now shall I lift up the face of man, and I shall not flatter to man.
For I knew not, shall I flatter; for a little while, he making me will take me away.
And yet hear now, O Job, my speech, and give ear to all my words.
Behold, now, I opened my mouth, my tongue spake in my palate.
My sayings the uprightness of my heart, and my lips spake knowledge purely.
The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty will cause me to live.
If thou shalt be able to turn back to me, set in order before me, stand forth.
Behold, I am according to thy mouth for God: from clay was I also broken off.
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, and my hand shall not be heavy upon thee.
Surely thou spakest in mine ear and I will hear the voice of thy words.
I am clean without transgression; I am fair, and no iniquity to me.
Behold, he will find enmity against me, and he will reckon me for an enemy to him.
He will set my feet in the stocks, he will watch all my paths.
Behold, this thou wert not just: I will answer thee, for God will be great above man.
Wherefore didst thou contend against him? for he will not answer all his words.
For God will speak at once, and at a second time, and he shall not regard it.
In a dream, in a vision of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men, in slumbers upon the bed;
Then he will uncover the ear of men, and will seal in their instruction,
To remove man from working, and he will bide pride from man.
He will keep back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the spear.
And he was chastened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones perpetually.
His life loathed bread, and his soul food of desire.
His flesh will consume away from seeing, and they saw not the nakedness of his bones.
And his soul will draw near to the pit, and his life to the dead.
If there is a messenger upon him, an interpreter, one from a thousand, to announce to man his uprightness:
And he will compassionate him and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I found an expiation.
His flesh revived above a youth: he shall turn back to the days of his childhood.
He shall pray to God and he shall receive him into favor: and he shall see his face with rejoicing, and he will turn back to man his justice.
He will look upon men, and he shall say, I sinned, and I perverted the right, and it was not fitting to me;
Redeem my soul from passing into the pit, and my life shall look upon light.
Behold, all these God will work twice, thrice, with man,
To turn back his soul from the pit, to enlighten with the light of the living.
Attend, O Job, hear to me: be silent and I will speak.
If there be words, turn back to me: speak, for I desired to justify thee.
If not, hear thou to me: be silent, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
And Elihu will answer and say,
Hear, ye wise, my words; and ye knowing, give ear to me.
For the ear will try words, and the palate will taste of food.
We will choose to us judgment: we shall know between ourselves what is good.
For Job said, I was just: and God removed my judgment.
Shall I speak falsehood against my judgment? mine arrow was desperate without transgression.
What man as Job he will drink scoffing as water?
Going for company with those working iniquity, and to go with men of injustice?
For he said, It will not profit a man in delighting himself with God.
For this, ye men of heart, hear to me: far be it to God from doing evil; and the Almighty from iniquity.
For the work of man shall he recompense to him, and a man shall find himself according to his way.
Also surely God will not do evil, and the Almighty will not pervert judgment.
Who committed to him the earth? and who set up the habitable globe all of it?
If he will set his heart to him, he will gather his spirit and his breath to him;
All flesh shall expire together, and man shall turn back to dust.
If now understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words.
Also shall he hating judgment, rule? and if thou wilt condemn the just mighty one?
Saying to the king, Wickedness; (Belial) to nobles, Injustice.
Who accepted not the face of chiefs, and looked not upon the rich one before the poor: for his hand made all of them.
In a moment shall they die, and the middle of the night shall the people be moved and pass away: and the mighty shall be removed with not a hand.
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he will see all his steps.
Not darkness and not the shadow of death for those working iniquity to hide there.
For he will not yet set upon man to go to God in judgment.
He shall break in pieces the mighty, not searching out, and he will set others in their stead.
For this he will know their work, and he turned the night, and they will be crushed.
He struck them for the unjust in the place of those seeing;
Who therefore turned away from after him, and they consider not all his ways,
To cause the cry of the poor one to come to him, and he will hear the cry of the humble.
And he will give quiet, and who shall disturb? and he will hide the face, and who shall look upon him? and against a nation and against man wholly:
From the reigning of the profane man from the people being snared.
For he said to God, I was lifted up, I will pervert no more.
Besides I shall see thou wilt teach it to me: if I did iniquity, I will not add.
Is it with thee? he will requite it, if thou didst refuse, if thou shalt choose, and not I: and what thou knewest, speak.
Men of heart will say to me, and a wise man heard to me.
Job will speak not with knowledge, and his word not with understanding.
My father, Job shall be tried even to the end, for turning back with men of iniquity.
He will add rebellion to his sin; he will clap between us, and he will multiply his words to God.
And Elihu will answer and say,
Didst thou reckon this for judgment thou saidst, My justice is above God?
For thou wilt say, What shall it profit to thee? what shall I profit from my sin?
I will turn back words to thee, and thy companions with thee.
Look upon the heavens and see; behold the clouds, they were high above thee.
If thou sinnedst, what wilt thou do against him? and thy transgressions were multiplied, what wilt thou do to him?
If thou wert just, what wilt thou give to him? or what shall he take from thy hand?
Thy injustice to a man as thou: and thy justice to the son of man.
From the multitude of oppressions they will cry out: they will cry out from the arm of the many.
And not saying, Where is God making me? he gave songs in the night.
And who teacheth us from the cattle of the earth, and he will make us wise above the birds of the heavens?
Then they will cry, and he will not answer from the face of the pride of the evil.
Also God will not hear vanity, and the Almighty will not look upon it.
Also if thou shalt say thou wilt not see him, judgment is before him, and thou shalt wait for him.
And now that it is not, he reviewed his anger, and he knew not in great transgression.
And Job will open his mouth in vain; he will bind together words without knowledge.
And Elihu will add and say,
Wait for me a little, and I will show thee, for yet words for God.
I will lift up my knowledge from far off, and to him making me, I will give justice.
For truly my words are not falsehood: the perfect of knowledge with thee.
Behold, God is mighty, and he will not despise: mighty in strength of heart.
He will not save alive the unjust one, and he will give the judgment of the poor.
He will not take off his eyes from the just: and with kings upon the throne, and he will seat them for glory, and they shall be exalted.
And they being bound in fetters shall be taken in the cords of affliction.
And he will announce to them their work, and their transgressions, for they will be strong.
And he will uncover their ear for instruction, and he will say that they shall turn back from iniquity.
If they will hear and will serve him, they shall finish their days in good, and their years in delights.
And if they will not hear, they shall pass away by the spear, and they shall expire without knowledge.
And the profane of heart shall set up anger: they will not cry if he bound them.
Their soul will die in youth, and their life among the consecrated.
He will deliver the poor one in his affliction, and he will uncover their ear in oppression.
And also he moved thee from the mouth of the enemy to a broad, not straight place; and thy table came down full of fatness.
And thou didst fill up the judgment of the unjust one; judgment and right shall hold together.
Because of wrath, lest he shall remove thee with smiting, and a multitude of covering shall not turn thee away.
Will he value thy riches? not gold and all the powers of thy strength.
Thou shalt not pant after the night, for taking up peoples in their place.
Watch thyself; thou shalt not turn to iniquity: for upon this thou didst choose rather than affliction.
Behold, God will exalt by his power: who teaches like him?
Who charged upon him his way? and who said, Thou didst iniquity?
Remember that thou shalt magnify his work which men beheld.
Every man looked upon it; man shall see from far off.
Behold, God is great, and we shall not know the number of his years, and it was not searched out.
For he will withhold the drops of water: they will pour out rain for its vapor.
Which the clouds will shake out; they will drop an abundance upon man.
Also if he shall understand the spreadings of the cloud, the noise of his booth.
Behold, he spread upon it his light, and he covered the roots of the sea.
For by them he will judge the peoples; he will give food to abundance.
With the hands be covered the light; and he commanded concerning it with a mark.
His thunder will announce concerning him, and the flock also concerning the going up.
Also at this my heart shall tremble, and it will leap from its place.
Hearing, hear ye, to the noise of his voice, and the growling going out from his mouth.
He will let it go free under all the heavens, and his light upon the wings of the earth.
After him a voice shall rear; he will thunder with the voice of his majesty: and he will not leave them behind when his voice shall be heard.
God will thunder with his voice of wonder, doing great things, and we shall not know.
For he will say to the snow, Be it on earth; and to the shower of rain, and to the shower of the rains of his strength.
He will seal in the hand of every man, for all men to know his work.
And the beast shall go into the covert, and shall dwell in its habitation.
From the chamber shall come forth the whirlwind, and cold from the scatterings.
From the breath of God ice will be given, and the breadth of the waters in being straitened.
Also by watering he will cast down the cloud: he will scatter the cloud of his light:
Being turned by his guidance to their doing all that he commanded them upon the face of the habitable globe of the earth.
If for the rod, if for his land, if for mercy, it shall find him.
Give ear to this, O Job: stand and consider the wonders of God.
Shalt thou know in God's setting upon them, and he caused the light of his cloud to shine?
Shalt thou know upon the poisings of the cloud, the wonders of the complete of knowledges?
That thy garments are warm in quieting the earth from the south?
Wilt thou spread out with him to the clouds, strong as the sight of a melted mass?
Make known to us what we shall say to him we shall not set in order from the face of darkness.
Shall it be recounted to him that I shall speak? If a man spake, then shall he be swallowed down.
And now they saw not the bright light that is in the clouds: and the wind passed over and it will cleanse them.
From the north, gold shall come: upon God terrible majesty.
The Almighty we found not: great of power and judgment, and much justice, he will not afflict.
For this, men shall fear him: he will not see all the wise of heart.
And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,
Who this darkening counsel in words without knowledge?
Gird now thy loins as a man; and I will ask thee, and make thou known to me.
Where wert thou in my founding the earth? Announce, if thou knewest understanding.
Who set its measures, if thou shalt know? or who stretched the line upon it?
Upon what were its bases impressed? or who placed its corner-stone?
In the rejoicing together of the stars of morning, and all the sons of God will shout for joy?
And he will hedge in the sea with doors in its breaking forth, going forth from the womb.
In my making the cloud its garment, and darkness its bandage:
And I shall break upon it my law, and I shall set bars and doors;
And saying, Even to this shalt thou come, and thou shalt not add: and here in the pride of thy waves, stand thou.
In thy days didst thou command the morning? and didst thou make the dawning know its place?
To take hold upon the wings of the earth, and the unjust shall be shaken out of it?
It shall be turned as clay to the seal; and they shall stand as clothing.
And their light shall be withheld from the unjust, and the high arm shall be broken.
Didst thou go even to the fountains of the sea? and didst thou go about in searching the depth?
Were the gates of death uncovered to thee? and shalt thou see the gates of the shadow of death?
Wilt thou consider even to the breadth of the earth? Announce if thou knewest all of it.
Where the way light shall dwell? and darkness, where its place?
That thou shalt take it to its bound, and that thou shalt understand the beaten paths of its house?
Knewest thou? for shalt thou then be born, and the number of thy days great?
Didst thou come into the treasures of snow? and shalt thou see the treasures of hail,
Which I kept back for the time of straits, for the day of encounter and war?
Where that way the light will divide, it will scatter the east wind upon the earth?
Who divided a channel for the overflowing, and a way for the lightning of the voices?
To cause it to rain upon the earth, not a man; the wilderness not a man in it?
To satisfy the desolation and burning, and to cause the springing up of the finding of the tender grass?
Is there a father to the rain? or who begat the reservoirs of the dew?
From whose womb came forth the ice? and the hoarfrost of the heavens, who brought it forth?
The waters shall be hid as a stone, and the face of the depth will be taken.
Wilt thou bind the bands of the cluster, or wilt thou open the cords of Orion?
Wilt thou bring forth the twelve signs in its time? and the great bear and his sons, wilt thou guide them?
Knewest thou the laws of the heavens? or wilt thou set up its dominion in the earth?
Wilt thou lift up thy voice to the cloud, and abundance of waters shall cover thee?
Shalt thou send lightnings, and shall they go and shall they say to thee, Behold us?
Who put wisdom in the reins? or who gave understanding to the mind?
Who shall number the clouds in wisdom? and who shall cause the bottles of heaven to lie down?
In the pouring out of the dust into a melted mass, and the clods will adhere.
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? and wilt thou fill up the life of the young lions?
For they will sink down in the dwellings; they will dwell in the thicket to lie in wait.
Who will prepare for the raven his food? for his young will cry to God; they will wander without food.
Knewest thou the time of the bringing forth of the wild goats of the rock? and wilt thou watch the bearing of the hinds?
Wilt thou number the months they shall fill up? and didst thou know the time of their bringing forth?
They will bow, they will bring forth their children, they will cast forth their pains.
Their sons will be fat, they will increase with grain; they will go forth and not turn back to them.
Who sent the wild ass free? and who opened the bonds of the wild ass?
To whom did I set the desert his house, and the salt land his dwellings?
He will laugh at the multitude of the city; he will not hear the noise of him driving.
The searching out of the mountains his pasture, and he will seek after every green thing.
Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee, or will he lodge by thy stall?
Wilt thou bind the buffalo in the furrow with cords, or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
Wilt thou trust in him because great his strength? and wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
Wilt thou believe in him that he will turn back thy seed and gather to thy threshing-floor?
The wings of ostriches exulted; and the wing-feather of the stork and the pinion.
For she will leave her eggs to the earth, and she will warm them in the dust;
And she will forget that the foot will press it, and the beast of the field will crush it.
She made hard to her sons as not to her: her labor in vain without fear;
For God caused her to forget wisdom, and he divided not to her in understanding.
For the time she will lash herself up upon height, she will laugh at the horse and at his rider.
Wilt thou give strength to the horse? wilt thou clothe his neck with thunder?
Wilt thou cause him to tremble as the locust? the glory of his snorting is terror.
They will dig in the valley, and he will rejoice in strength: he will go forth to the meeting of the weapon.
He will laugh at fear, and he will not be dismayed; and he will not turn back from the face of the sword.
The quiver will give forth a whizzing against him, the flame of the spear and the javelin.
With leaping and rage he will swallow the earth; and he will not believe that it is the voice of the trumpet.
He will say according to the multitude of the trumpet, Aha! and he will smell the battle from far off, the thunder of the chiefs, and the war cry.
From thy understanding will the hawk mount upwards? will it stretch its wings to the south?
If at thy mouth the eagle will lift itself up, and if it will raise up its nest?
She will dwell in the rock, and she will lodge upon the cliff of the rock and the fortress.
From thence it sought food; far off shall its eyes behold.
Her young shall suck up the blood: and where the wounded, there is she.
And Jehovah will answer Job, and he will say,
Shall he contending with the Almighty, instruct? he reproving God shall answer it.
And Job will answer Jehovah, and say,
Behold, I was vile; what shall I turn back to thee? I put my hand to my mouth.
Once I sake, and I will not answer: and twice, and I will not add.
And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,
Gird up now thy loins as a man; I will ask thee, and do thou make known to me.
Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me so that thou shalt be just?
And if an arm to thee as God? and with thy voice wilt thou thunder as he?
Deck thyself now with majesty and grandeur, and thou shalt put on ornament and splendor.
Scatter the overflowings of thine anger, and see every proud one and bring him low.
See every proud one, and humble him; and crush the unjust in their place.
Hide them in the dust together, and bind their faces in hiding.
And also I will confess to thee that thy right hand shall save for thee.
Behold now, the great beast which I made with thee; he will eat grass as an ox.
Behold now, his strength in his loins, and his power in the sinews of his belly.
He will bend his tail as a cedar; the sinews of his thighs will be woven together.
His bones tubes of brass; his bones as a hammered bar of iron.
He the chief of the ways of God: he making him, his sword will reach.
For the mountains shall lift up produce for him, and all the beasts of the field shall play there.
He will lie down under the shades, in the covering of the reed and marsh.
The shades shall cover him with their shadow; the willows of the torrent shall surround him.
Behold, he will oppress a river, and he will not spring up: he will trust that Jordan burst forth into his mouth.
He will take it with his eyes: his nose will pierce through snares.
Wilt thou draw out the crocodile with a hook and with a cord wilt thou press down his tongue?
Wilt thou put a rope in his nose? and wilt thou hollow out his jaw with a thorn?
Will he multiply supplications to thee? will he speak soft things to thee?
Will he cut out a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant forever?
Wilt thou play with him as a bird? and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
Shall companions give a feast upon him? shall they divide him between the Canaanites?
Wilt thou fill his skin with pointed weapons? and his head with fish spears?
Put thy hand upon him; remember the battle, thou shalt not add.
Behold, his hope was false: shall he not be cast down at his sight?
None fierce that he will rouse him up: and who is he will stand before me?
Who anticipated me, and I will recompense? under all the heavens it is to me.
I will not be silent for him, and the word of powers and the beauty of his preparation.
Who uncovered the face of his clothing? who shall come with his double bridle?
Who opened the doors of his face? his teeth a terror round about.
Pride of strong shields shut up with a seal of straitness.
One shall touch upon another, and the wind shall not come between them.
They will adhere each in his brotherhood, they will hold together, and they will not be separated.
His sneezings a light will shine, and his eyes as the eyelashes of the dawning of day.
From his mouth flaming torches shall go forth; sparks of fire will escape.
From his nostrils smoke will come forth as a blown pot, and a caldron.
His soul will kindle coals, and a flame will go forth from his mouth.
In his neck will lodge strength, and terror will leap before him.
The flaps of his flesh adhered: it will press upon him; it will not be moved.
His heart will press as a stone; and it will press as the under millstone.
His lifting up, the mighty will be stirred up: from breaking they shall purify themselves.
The sword reaching him, shall not be raised up: the spear, the dart, and the coat of mail.
He will reckon iron for straw, and brass for wood of rottenness.
The son of the bow shall not cause him to flee: sling-stones were turned to him for stubble.
The bludgeon was reckoned to him for stubble: and he will laugh at the shaking of the javelin.
Sharpnesses of the potsherd under him: he will spread a trench upon the mire.
He will cause the deep to boil as a pot: he will set the sea as ointment.
He will cause a beaten path to shine after him: the deep will be reckoned to be hoary.
None upon the dust being like him; he made him without fear.
He will see every thing high: he is king over all the sons of pride.
And Job will answer Jehovah, and he will say,
I knew that thou wilt be able to do all, and counsel shall not be restrained from thee.
Who this hiding counsel without knowledge? for this, I announced, and I shall not understand; wonders above me, and I shall not know.
Hear, now, and I will speak: I will ask thee and make thou known to me.
By the hearing of the ear I heard of thee: and now mine eyes saw thee:
For this, I shall melt away, and I lamented in dust and ashes.
And it will be after Jehovah spake these words to Job, and Jehovah will say to Eliphaz the Temanite, Mine anger was kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye spake not the right before me as my servant Job.
And now take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and bring up a burnt-offering for yourselves; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for his face I will accept, so as not to do with you for folly, for ye spake not to me the right as my servant Job.
And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite, will go, and they will do according as God Jehovah spake: and Jehovah will accept the face of Job.
And Jehovah turned back the captivity of Job in his praying for his friends: and Jehovah added all which was to Job, to the double.
And there will come to him all his brethren and all his sisters, and all knowing him before; and they will eat bread with him in his house: and they will deplore for him, and they will comfort him upon all the evil which Jehovah brought upon him: and they will give to him each one weight, and each one ring of gold.
And Jehovah blessed the latter state of Job more than his beginning: and there will be to him fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.
And there will be to him seven sons and three daughters.
And he will call the name of the one, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-Happuch.
And women were not found fair as the daughters of Job, in all the land: and their father will give to them an inheritance in the midst of their brethren.
And Job will live after this a hundred and forty years, and he will see his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.
And Job will die, old and full of days.
Happy the man who went not in the counsel of the unjust, and he stood not in the way of the sinful, and sat not in the seat of those scoffing.
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he will meditate day and night.
And he was as a tree planted by the streams of water which will give its fruit in its time; his leaf shall not fall away, and all which he shall do shall be prospered.
Not so the unjust: but as the chaff which the wind shall drive away.
For this, the unjust shall not rise up in judgment, and the sinful in the assembly of the just.
For Jehovah shall know the way of the just: but the way of the unjust shall perish.
Wherefore did the nations rage, and the peoples will meditate emptiness?
The kings of the earth will place themselves, and the princes sat down together against Jehovah and against his Messiah.
We will tear away his bands, and we will cast away his cords from us.
He dwelling in the heavens shall laugh: Jehovah shall deride to them.
Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and in his burning shall he terrify them.
And I anointed my king over Zion my holy mountain.
I will recount for a law of Jehovah: He said to me, Thou my son; this day I begat thee.
Ask of me and I will give the nations thine inheritance, and thy possession the extremities of the earth.
Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; as a potter's vessel shalt thou break them in pieces.
And now be circumspect, ye and be silent Silence.
Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the chosen lest he shall be angry, and ye perish in the way when his anger shall kindle as a little. Happy all they putting their trust in him.

To the overseer upon the stringed instruments; chanting of David. In my calling, answer me, O God of my justice: in straits thou didst enlarge me; compassionate me and hear my prayer.
Sons of man, how long mine honor for shame? Ye will love emptiness, ye will seek falsehood. Silence.
And know ye that Jehovah separated the kind one to himself: Jehovah will hear in my calling to him.
Be ye disturbed, and ye shall not sin: say in your heart upon your bed,
Sacrifice ye the sacrifices of justice, and trust to Jehovah.
Many saying, Who will cause us to see good? Lift up upon us the light of thy face, O Jehovah.
Thou gavest gladness in my heart, from the time their grain and their new wine increased.
In peace together shall I lie down, and I shall sleep: for thou Jehovah alone wilt cause me to dwell confidently.
To the overseer of the pipes; chanting of David. Give ear to my sayings, O Jehovah; attend to my cry.
Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God: for to thee will I pray.
O Jehovah, the morning thou wilt hear my voice; the morning I will set in order to thee, and I will look about.
For thou not a God delighting in injustice: and evil shall not dwell with thee.
The foolish shall not stand before thine eyes: thou hatedst all working vanity.
Thou shalt destroy those speaking falsehood: a man of bloods and deceit Jehovah will abhor.
And I in the multitude of thy mercy will come into thy house; I will worship to thy holy temple in thy fear.
O Jehovah, guide me into thy justice, for sake of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
Not steadfast in his mouth; the midst of them mischiefs; their throat a grave opened; they will be smooth with their tongue,
Punish them, O God: they shall fall by their counsels; in the multitude of their transgressions thrust them down, for they rebelled against thee.
And all they putting trust in thee shall rejoice forever: they shall shout for joy, and thou wilt cover over them: and they loving thy name shall exult in thee.
For thou wilt bless the just, O Jehovah: thou wilt surround him with favor as a shield.
To the overseer upon the stringed instruments upon the octave, chanting of David. O Jehovah, not in thine anger wilt thou correct me, and not in thy wrath wilt thou chastise me.
Compassionate me, O Jehovah, for I languish: heal me, O Jehovah, for my bones trembled.
My soul trembled exceedingly: and thou, O Jehovah, how long?
Turn back, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: save me for sake of thy mercy.
For in death none remembering thee: in hades who shall give thanks to thee?
I was wearied with my sighing all the night I shall make my bed to swim with my tears; I shall make my couch to flow.
Mine eye fell away from grief; it grew old among all mine enemies.
Depart from me, all ye doing vanity, for Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping.
Jehovah heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
All mine enemies shall be ashamed, they shall tremble exceedingly they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
Song of David which he sang to Jehovah upon the words of Cush, son of the right hand. O Jehovah my God, in thee I put My trust: save me from all pursuing me, and deliver me:
Lest he shall rend my soul as the lion, breaking in pieces and none delivering.
O Jehovah my God, if I did this, if there is iniquity in my hand;
If I rewarded evil him being at peace with me; (and I will deliver mine enemy undeservedly:)
The enemy will pursue my soul, and overtake; and he will tread down my life to the earth, and he will cause mine honor to dwell upon the dust Silence.
Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger, lift up thyself for the wrath of mine enemies: and awake to me the judgment thou didst command.
And the assembly of the people shall surround thee: and for it turn back on high.
Jehovah shall judge peoples: judge me, O Jehovah, according to my justice, and according to mine integrity upon me.
Now shall the evil of the unjust come to an end; and thou wilt direct the just one: for the just God tried hearts and reins.
My shield upon God, saving the upright of heart.
God judging the just one, and being angry in all the days.
If he shall not turn back, he will sharpen his sword; he bent his bow and he will be prepared.
And he prepared to himself the instruments of death; he will work his arrows for those inflaming.
Behold, lie will bring forth vanity, and he conceived trouble, and he will bring forth falsehood.
He dug a pit, and he will dig it out, and he will fall into the pitfall he will make.
His trouble shall turn back upon his head, and his violence shall come down upon his crown.
I will confess to Jehovah according to his justice: and I will play on the harp to the name of Jehovah most high.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument, chanting of David. O Jehovah our Lord, how mighty thy name in all the earth! who will set thy majesty over the heavens.
Out of the mouth of children and sucklings thou hast founded strength on account of thine enemies, to cause the enemy and the avenger to cease.
For I shall see thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou didst prepare.
What is man that thou wilt remember him? and the son of man that thou wilt review him?
And thou wilt diminish him a little more than the messengers, and thou wilt surround him with glory and honor.
And thou wilt give him dominion over the works of thy hands; thou didst put all under his feet:
Sheep and oxen, all of them, and also the cattle of the field;
And the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, passing through the paths of the seas.
O Jehovah our Lord, how mighty thy name in all the earth!
To the overseer upon the death of Laban, chanting of David. I will praise, O Jehovah, with all my heart; I will recount all thy wonderful works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will play on the harp to thy name, O Most High.
In the turning away of mine enemies backward, they shall be weak and perish from thy face.
For thou didst my judgment and my cause; thou satest upon the throne judging justice.
Thou didst rebuke the nations, thou didst destroy the unjust one, wiping off their name forever and ever.
O enemy! desolations were wholly finished, and thou didst tear down cities; their remembrance perished with them.
And Jehovah shall dwell forever: he prepared his throne for judgment.
And he will judge the habitable globe in justice, he will judge peoples in uprightness.
And Jehovah will be a height for the oppressed one, a height for times in straits.
And they knowing thy name will trust in thee, for thou didst not forsake those seeking thee, O Jehovah.
Play on the harp to Jehovah dwelling in Zion: announce among the peoples his doings.
For he sought out bloods, be remembered them: he forget not the cry of the humble.
Compassionate me, O Jehovah: see my affliction from those hating me, thou lifting me up from the gates of death:
So that I shall recount all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
The nations sank into the pit they made: in the net they hid, their foot was taken by it.
And Jehovah was known by the judgment he did: by the work of his hands the unjust was snared. Meditation. Silence.
The unjust shall be turned away into hades, all the nations forgetting God.
For the needy shall not be forgotten forever: the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.
Arise, O Jehovah; man shall not be strengthened: the nations shall be judged before thee.
Put fear to them, O Jehovah: the nations shall know they are man. Silence.
Wherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou stand afar off? wilt thou hide for times in straits?
In the pride of the unjust he will burn the poor: they shall be taken in the devices that they purposed.
For the unjust boasted upon the desire of his soul, and he blessed him plundering, despising Jehovah.
The unjust according to the height of his anger, will not seek: God is not in all his thoughts.
His ways will be in pain in all time; thy judgments high from before him: all his enemies he will puff at them.
Saying in his heart, I shall not be moved: to generation and generation for not in evil.
His mouth was filled with cursing and deceit and violence: under his tongue, trouble and vanity.
Sitting in ambush of the enclosures: in hiding-places he will slay the innocent: his eyes will be hid to the afflicted.
He will lie in wait in secret as the lion in her den: he will lie in wait to catch the poor one: he will catch the poor one in drawing him into his net.
And crushing, he will bow down, and cast down the afflicted by his strong ones.
Saying in his heart, God forgat: he hid his face; not seeing forever.
Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thine hand: thou wilt not forget the poor.
For what did the unjust one despise God, saying in his heart, Thou wilt not search?
Thou sawest; for thou wilt look upon trouble and anger, to give with thine hand: the poor will be left to thee; thou wert the helper of the orphan.
Break the arm of the unjust and the evil one: thou wilt seek out his injustice; thou wilt not find.
Jehovah is King forever and ever: the nations perished from his land.
Thou heardest the desire of the poor, O Jehovah: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to attend.
To judge the orphan and the dejected, that the man of the earth shall no more add to make afraid.
To the overseer; of David. In Jehovah I put my trust: how will ye say to my soul, Wander ye to your mountain, little bird?
For behold, the unjust will bend the bow, they prepared their arrow upon the cord, they will shoot in darkness the upright of heart.
If the pillars shall be pulled down, what did the just one?
Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, in the heavens his throne: his eyes will behold, his eyelashes will try the sons of man.
Jehovah will try the just one: and the unjust and him loving violence, his soul hated.
He will rain upon the, unjust, snares, fire and brimstone, and a wind of violent heat: the portion of their cup.
For Jehovah the just loved justice; his face will behold the upright.
To the overseer upon the octave, chanting of David. Save, O Jehovah, for the merciful one ceased; for faithfulnesses failed from the sons of men.
They will speak vanity each with his neighbor: smooth lips, with a heart and a heart will they speak.
Jehovah will cut off all smooth lips, and the tongue speaking great things:
Who said, By our tongues we shall prevail; our lips are with us: who is Lord over us?
From the oppression of the poor, from the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, Jehovah will say; I will set with salvation, he will puff at him.
The sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings: silver tried in the crucible of the earth, purified seven times.
Thou, O Jehovah, shalt watch them, keep from this generation forever.
The unjust shall walk round about as the rising of a tempest to the sons of man.
To the overseer; chanting of David.
How long, O Jehovah, wilt thou wholly forget me? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
How long shall I put counsels in my soul, grief in my heart the day? how long shall mine enemy rise up against me?
Look upon, answer me, O Jehovah my God: enlighten mine eyes, lest I shall sleep the death;
Lest mine enemy shall say, I prevailed against him; mine adversaries shall exult when I shall be moved.
And I trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall exult in thy salvation. I will sing to Jehovah for he benefited me.
To the overseer; of David. The fool said in his heart, No God. They were corrupted, they made their; works abominable, none doing good.
Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the sons of men, to see is there he understanding, seeking God.
All turned away together, they were corrupted: none doing good, not even one.
Did not the workers of vanity know? eating my people they ate bread; they called not Jehovah.
There they feared a fear: for God is in the generation of the just one.
Ye will shame the counsel of the poor, for Jehovah is his refuge.
Who will give out of Zion the salvation of Israel? in Jehovah bringing back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall exult, Israel shall rejoice.
Chanting of David. O Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tent? who shall dwell in thy holy mountain?
He going blameless, and working justice, and speaking truth in his heart.
Slandering not with his tongue, not doing evil to his neighbor, lifting up no reproach against his neighbor.
In his eyes a reprobate being despised; and those fearing Jehovah, he will honor. Swearing to the friend, and he will not change.
Not giving his silver for interest, and gave not presents against the innocent. He doing these things shall not be moved forever.
Writing of David Watch me, O God: in thee I put my trust.
Thou saidst to Jehovah, Thou my Lord: my good not upon thee.
To the holy ones that are upon the earth, they and the mighty ones, all my delight is in them.
Their labors shall be multiplied after they hastened: I will not gather their libations of blood, and I will not lift up their names upon my lips.
Jehovah the portion of my part and of my cup: thou didst hold up my lot.
The cords fell to me in sweetnesses; also the inheritance was bountiful upon me.
I will praise Jehovah who counseled me: also the night my reins instructed me.
I set Jehovah before me always: for from my right hand I shall not be moved.
For this my heart rejoiced, and my glory shall exult: also my flesh shall dwell with confidence.
For thou wilt not leave my soul to hades; thou wilt not give thy merciful ones to see corruption.
Thou wilt cause me to know the way of life: abundance of joys with thy face; favors in thy right hand forever.
Prayer of David. Hear justice, O Jehovah, attend to my outcry, give ear to my prayer, not in lips of deceit.
From thy face shall my judgment go forth; thine eyes will see uprightnesses.
Thou didst try my heart; thou didst review the night; thou didst refine me, thou wilt find nothing: I purposed, my mouth shall not pass by.
For the works of men, by the word of thy lips I watched the ways of the violent one.
Hold up my being straight in thy ways, my steps be not moved.
I called thee, for thou wilt answer me, O God: incline thine ear to me, hear my sayings.
Make thy kindnesses distinguished, thou saving those putting their trust, from those rising up against thy right hand.
Watch me as the pupil of the daughter of the eye: thou wilt hide me in the shadow of thy wings.
From the face of the unjust that laid me waste, enemies against the soul will go round about against me.
They shut up their fat: their mouth spake in pride.
We went straight, now they surrounded us: their eyes they will set to incline to the earth;
His likeness as a lion will long for the prey, and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.
Arise, O Jehovah, anticipate his face, cast him down: deliver my soul from the unjust, thy sword.
From men of thy hand, O Jehovah, from men of this world their portion in life, and thou wilt fill their belly with thy hidden things: they will be filled with sons, they left the remaining things to their children.
I in justice shall see thy face: I shall be satisfied in awaking with thine appearance.
To the overseer; to the servant of Jehovah, of David who spake to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he will say, I will love thee, O Jehovah, my strength.
Jehovah is my rock and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, I will put my trust in him; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my height.
Praising, I will call upon Jehovah, and I shall be saved from mine enemies.
The pains of death surrounded me, and the torrents of Belial made me afraid.
The pains of hades surrounded me: the snares of death anticipated me.
In my straits I will call upon Jehovah, and to my God will I cry: he will hear my voice from his temple, and my cry will come before him into his ears.
And it will be moved and the earth will tremble, and the foundations of the mountains will be moved and they will shake, for it was kindled to him.
A smoke went up in his anger, and fire from his mouth will consume, and coals were kindled from it.
And he will incline the heavens and come down: and gloom under his feet.
And he will ride upon a cherub, and will fly: and he will fly upon the wings of the wind.
He will set darkness his covering; his tent round about him darknesses of waters, thick clouds.
From the brightness before him the clouds passed over, hail and coals of fire.
And Jehovah will thunder in the heavens, and the Most High will give his voice; hail and coals of fire.
And he will send his arrows and scatter them; and he increased lightnings, and he will discomfit them.
And the channels of waters will be seen, and the foundations of the habitable globe will be uncovered from thy rebuke, O Jehovah, from the breathing of the spirit of thine anger.
He will send forth from on high, he will take me, he will draw me out of many waters.
He will deliver me from my strong enemy, and from them hating me: for they were strong above me.
They will anticipate me in the day of my calamity, and Jehovah will be a support to me.
And he will bring me forth to a wide place: he will deliver me, for he delighted in me.
Jehovah will recompense me according to my justice, according to the cleanness of my hands he will turn back to me.
For I watched the ways of Jehovah, and I acted not wickedly from my God.
For all his judgments are before me, and his laws I shall not put away from me.
And I blameless with him, and I will watch myself from mine iniquity.
And Jehovah will turn back to me according to my justice, and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.
With the kind thou wilt show thyself kind; and with the blameless man thou wilt be perfect.
With the purified thou wilt be purified, and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself perverse.
Thou wilt save the humble people, and thou wilt humble the eyes of the lifted up.
For thou wilt enlighten my lamp Jehovah my God will give light to my darkness.
For by thee I will break down a troop, and in my God I will leap upon the wall.
God, blameless his way: the saying of Jehovah being refined: a shield to all trusting in him.
For who is God besides Jehovah? or who a rock except our God?
God girding me with strength, and he will give my way blameless.
Setting my feet as the hinds, and he will cause me to stand upon my heights.
Teaching my hands to war, and a bow of brass was bent by mine arms.
Thou wilt give to me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand will uphold me, and thy clemency will enlarge me.
Thou wilt make broad my steps under me and my joints did not waver.
I will pursue mine enemies, and I will overtake them: and I shall not turn back till consuming them.
I will smite them through and through, and they shall not be able to rise: they shall fall under my feet.
Thou wilt gird one with strength for war: thou wilt bend under me those rising up against me.
Mine enemies thou gavest the back of the neck to me, and I shall destroy those hating me.
They will cry and none saving: to Jehovah, and he answered them not.
And I will beat them in pieces as dust upon the face of the wind: I will pour them out as the mire of the streets.
Thou wilt deliver me from the contentions of the people; thou wilt set me for head of the nations: a people I knew not shall serve me.
At the hearing of the ear they shall hear to me: sons of the stranger shall feign to me.
Sons of the stranger shall fall away, and they shall tremble from their enclosings.
Jehovah lives; and praised be my Rock; and the God of my salvation shall be exalted.
God giving vengeance to me, and he will speak the peoples under me.
Delivering me from mine enemies: from those rising up thou wilt lift me up: thou wilt deliver me from the man of violence.
For this I will praise thee among the nations, O Jehovah, and I will play on the harp to thy name.
Magnifying the salvation of his king; and he did mercy to his anointed, and to David and to his seed even to forever.
To the overseer; chanting of David. The heavens recounting the glory of God, and the firmament announcing the work of his hands.
Day to day will gush out the saying, and night to night will breathe out knowledge.
No saying and no words without their voice being heard.
Their line went forth into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the habitable globe. In them he set a tent for the sun.
And he as a bridegroom coming forth from his nuptial couch, will rejoice as a strong one to run a way.
From the extremity of the heavens his going forth and his circuits upon their extremities and no hiding from his heat.
The law of Jehovah is blameless, turning back the soul; the testimonies of Jehovah being faithful, making wise the simple.
The mandates of Jehovah are straight, rejoicing the heart: the command of Jehovah pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of Jehovah being pure, standing forever: the judgments of Jehovah, truth, they were altogether just.
Being desirable above gold, and above much pure gold, and being sweet above honey, and the dropping of honey-combs.
Also thy servant being admonished by them: in watching them much reward.
Who will understand errors? acquit me from hidden things.
Also withhold thy servant from arrogant things; they shall not rule over me: then shall I be blameless, and I was acquitted from much transgression.
The saying of my mouth and the meditation of my heart shall be for acceptance before thee, O Jehovah, my rock and my redeemer.
To the overseer; chanting of David. Jehovah will answer thee in the day of straits; the name of the God of Jacob shall exalt thee.
He will send thy help from the holy place and from Zion he will support thee.
He will remember all thy gifts, and he will make fat thy burnt-offerings. Silence.
He will give to thee according to thy heart, and fill up all thy counsel.
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will cover over: Jehovah will fill up all our petitions.
Now I knew that Jehovah saved his Messiah; he will answer him from his holy heavens by the strength of the salvation of his right hand.
These in chariots, and these in horses: and in the name of Jehovah our God will we remember.
They bowed down and they fell: and we arose, and we shall stand erect.
O Jehovah, save: the king he will answer us in the day of our calling.
To the overseer; chanting of David. O Jehovah, in thy strength shall the king rejoice; and in thy salvation how shall he greatly exult.
The desire of his heart thou gavest to him, and the longing of his lips thou didst not withhold. Silence.
For thou wilt anticipate him with praises of goodness: thou wilt set a crown of pure gold to his head.
He asked life from thee; thou gavest to him length of days forever and ever.
Great his glory in thy salvation: majesty and honor thou wilt set upon him.
For thou wilt set him praises forever: thou wilt make him glad in joy with thy face.
For the king trusted in Jehovah, and in the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Thy hand shall find for all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find those hating thee.
Thou wilt set them as a furnace of fire for the time of thy face: Jehovah in his anger will swallow them down, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit thou wilt destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of man.
For they stretched out evil upon thee: they purposed a device, they will not prevail.
For thou wilt set them the shoulder among thine being left, thou wilt prepare against their face.
Be thou exalted, O Jehovah, in thy strength: we will sing and play thy powers upon the harp.
To the overseer upon the first place of the dawn; chanting of David. My God, my God, wherefore forsookest thou me? far off from my salvation the words of my groaning.
My God, I will call in the day, and thou wilt not answer; and in the night no silence to me.
And thou inhabiting the holy place, the praises of Israel.
In thee our fathers trusted: they trusted, and thou wilt deliver them.
To thee they cried and were delivered: in thee they trusted and were not ashamed.
And I a worm and not a man; a reproach of man, and the people despised me.
All seeing me will deride me: they will gape with the lip, they will shake the head.
He rolled upon Jehovah, he will deliver him: he will deliver him for he delighted in him.
Thou causing me to break forth from the womb: causing me to trust upon my mother's breasts.
Upon thee was I cast from the womb: from my mother's belly thou my God.
Thou wilt not remove far from me, for straits draw near; for none helping.
Many bulls surrounded me: the strong of Bashan surrounded me.
They opened their mouth upon me, a lion rending and roaring.
I was poured out as water, and all my bones were sundered; my heart was as wax being melted in the midst of my bowels.
My strength was dried up as the potsherd, and my tongue cleaving to my jaws; and thou wilt set me for the dust of death.
For dogs surrounded me: the assembly of those being evil moved round about me: they digged my hands and my feet.
I shall number all my bones: they will behold and look upon me.
They will divide my garments to them, and upon my clothing they will cast the lot.
And thou, O Jehovah, wilt not be far off: O my strength, hasten to help me.
Deliver my soul from the sword, my only one from the band of the dog.
Save me from the mouth of the lion: and thou didst answer me from the horns of the high.
I will recount thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the convocation I will praise thee.
Ye fearing Jehovah, praise him; all the seed of Jacob honor him; and be afraid of him all ye seed of Israel.
For he despised not and he abhorred not the afflictions of the bumble; and he hid not his face from him, and in his crying to him he heard.
Of thee my praise in the great convocation: I will complete my vows before them fearing him.
The humble shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise Jehovah they seeking him: your heart shall live forever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and shall turn back to Jehovah: and all the families of the nations shall worship before thee.
For to Jehovah the kingdom, and he rules among the nations.
All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship before him, and all they going down to dust shall bow down, and he preserved not alive his soul.
A seed shall serve him; it shall be numbered to Jehovah for a generation.
They shall come and announce his justice to a people being born, for he made.
Chanting of David. Jehovah my shepherd, and I shall not want.
He will cause me to lie down in pastures of tender grass: he will lead me to the water of rest.
He will turn back my soul: he will guide me into the tracks of justice for sake of his name.
Also if I shall go into the valley of the shadow of death, I shall not be afraid of evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they will comfort me.
Thou wilt set in order a table before me in front of mine enemies: thou madest fat mine head with oil; my cup being satisfied with drink.
Surely goodness and mercy, shall pursue me all the days of my life: and I dwelt in the house of Jehovah to the length of days.
To David chanting. To Jehovah the earth and its fulness, the habitable globe and they dwelling in it.
For he founded it upon the seas, and upon the rivers he will prepare it.
Who will go up to the mountain of Jehovah? and who shall stand in his holy place?
The blameless one of hands and the clean of heart; who lifted not up his soul to vanity, and swore not for deceit.
He shall receive a praise from Jehovah, and justice from God saving him.
This the generation seeking him, searching out thy face O Jacob. Silence.
Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye openings of eternity, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty for war.
Lift up, ye gates, your heads, and be lifted up, ye openings of eternity, and the King of glory shall come in.
Who is he, this King of glory? Jehovah of armies, he is the King of glory. Silence.
To David. To thee, O Jehovah, I will lift up my soul.
My God, in thee I trusted, I shall not be ashamed: mine enemies shall not exult over me.
Also all awaiting thee shall not be ashamed: they transgressing emptily shall be ashamed.
O Jehovah, cause me to know thy ways; teach me thy paths.
Cause me to tread in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art God saving me; on thee I waited all the day.
Remember thy compassions, O Jehovah, and thy mercies; for they are from forever.
The sins of my youth and my transgressions thou wilt not remember: according to thy mercy remember thou for me for sake of thy goodness, O Jehovah.
Good and upright is Jehovah: for this he will teach the sinning in the way.
He will cause the humble to trend in judgment, and he will teach the humble the way.
All the paths of Jehovah are mercy and truth to those watching his covenant and his testimonies.
For sake of thy name, O Jehovah, and thou forgavest to mine iniquity; for it was much.
Who this man fearing Jehovah? he will teach him in the way he shall choose.
His soul shall lodge in good, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The secret of Jehovah to them fearing him; and his covenant he will cause them to know.
Mine eyes are always to Jehovah, for he will bring forth my feet from the net.
Turn to me and pity me, for I alone and afflicted.
The straits of my heart were enlarged: bring me out from my distresses.
See mine affliction and my labor, and let go to all my sins.
See mine enemies, for they were many, and they hated me with the hatred of violence.
Watch my soul and deliver me: I shall not be ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.
Integrity and uprightness shall watch me; for I waited for thee.
Redeem Israel, O God, from all his straits.
To David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I went in mine integrity, and in Jehovah I trusted: I shall not waver.
Prove me, O Jehovah, and try me; refine my reins and my heart.
For thy mercy is before mine eyes, and I walked about in thy truth.
I sat not with men of vanity, and I will not go in with those lying hid.
I hated the convocation of those being evil, and with the unjust I will not sit.
I will wash my hands in cleanness, and I will surround thine altar, O Jehovah:
To hear with the voice of praise, and to recount all thy wonders.
O Jehovah, I loved the habitation of thy house, and the place of the dwelling of thine honor.
Thou wilt not gather my soul with the sinning, and my life with men of bloods:
Which in their hands mischief, and their right hand filled with gifts.
And I, I will go in mine integrity: redeem me and pity me.
My foot stood in straightness: in the convocations will I praise Jehovah.
To David. Jehovah my light and my saviour; of whom shall I be afraid? Jehovah the strength of my life; from whom shall I tremble?
In the drawing near of those doing evil to me, to eat my flesh, adversaries and enemies to me, they were weak and fell.
If a camp shall encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: if war shall rise up against me, in this I trust.
I asked one from Jehovah, I will seek it; I sat in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to look upon the sweetness of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.
For he will hide me in the booth in the day of evil: he will cover me with the covering of his tent; he will lift me up upon a rock.
And now he will lift up my head over mine enemies round about me: and I will sacrifice in his tent sacrifices of rejoicing; I will sing and I will play on the harp to Jehovah.
Hear my voice, O Jehovah: I will call, and pity me and answer me.
My heart said to thee, Seek ye my face; thy face, O Jehovah, I will seek.
Thou wilt not cover thy face from me; thou wilt not turn away thy servant in anger: thou, wert my help; thou wilt not leave me and thou wilt not forsake me, my God saving me.
For my father and my mother forsook me, and Jehovah will gather me.
Teach me, O Jehovah, thy way, and lead me in a path of straitness for sake of those pressing me.
Thou wilt not give me to the soul of him pressing me, for witnesses of falsehood rose up against me, and violence will blow.
Unless I believed to look upon the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living.
Wait for Jehovah: be strong, and thy heart shall be strengthened: and wait for Jehovah.
To David. To thee, O Jehovah, will I call, my rock; thou wilt not be silent from me: lest thou wilt be silent from me and I was made like with them going down to the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications in my crying to thee, in my lifting up my hands to the oracle of thy holy place.
Thou wilt not draw me with the unjust, and with those working vanity, speaking peace with their neighbors, and evil in their heart.
Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their doings, according to the word of their hands; give to them, turn back to them their recompense.
For they will not understand for the doing of Jehovah, and for the work of his hands; he will destroy them and he will not build them up.
Praised be Jehovah, for he heard the voice of my supplications.
Jehovah my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusted, and I was helped: and my heart will exult, and from my song will I praise him.
Jehovah strength to them, and he the fortress of salvations of his Messiah.
Save thy people and bless thine inheritance, and feed them and lift them up even forever.
Chanting of David. Give to Jehovah, ye sons of God, give to Jehovah glory and strength.
Give to Jehovah the glory of his name; worship to Jehovah in the splendors of his holy place.
The voice of Jehovah upon the waters: the God of glory thundered: Jehovah upon many waters.
The voice of Jehovah in power; the voice of Jehovah in splendor.
The voice of Jehovah broke the cedars; and Jehovah will break the cedars of Lebanon.
And he will cause them to leap as a calf; Lebanon and Sirion as the son of buffaloes.
The voice of Jehovah cut out the flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah will cause the desert to whirl; Jehovah will cause the desert of holiness to whirl.
The voice of Jehovah will cause the hinds to bring forth, and will uncover the forests: and in his temple every one said, Glory.
Jehovah sat upon the inundation: and Jehovah sat King forever.
Jehovah will give strength to his people; he will bless his people with peace.
Chanting a song of consecration of the house of David. I will exalt thee, O Jehovah, for thou didst draw me out, and thou didst not gladden mine enemies to me.
O Jehovah my God, I cried to thee, and thou wilt heal me.
O Jehovah, thou broughtest up my soul from hades: thou didst save me alive from those going down to the pit.
Play on the harp to Jehovah, ye his godly ones, and praise at the remembrance of his holiness.
For a moment in his anger; life in his acceptance: weeping shall lodge in the evening, and rejoicing for the morning.
And I said in my security, I shall not be moved forever.
O Jehovah, in thy good will thou didst cause strength to stand for my mountain: thou didst cover thy face, I was in trepidation.
To thee, O Jehovah, will I call, and to Jehovah will I make supplication.
What the profit in my blood in my going down to the pit? shall the dust praise thee? shall it announce thy truth?
Hear, O Jehovah, and pity me: O Jehovah, be a helper to me.
Thou didst turn my wailing to dancing to me: thou didst loose my sackcloth, and thou wilt gird me with gladness;
So that glory shall play on the harp to thee, and shall not be silent O Jehovah my God, I will praise thee forever.
To the overseer, chanting of David. In thee, O Jehovah, I put my trust, I shall not be ashamed forever: in thy justice deliver me.
Incline thine ear to me, hastening to deliver me: be to me for a rock of strength, for a house of fortresses to save me.
For thou my rock and my fortress; and for sake of thy name thou wilt guide me, and thou wilt protect me.
Thou wilt bring me forth from the net which they concealed for me: for thou my fortress.
Into thy hand I will commit my spirit: thou didst redeem me, O Jehovah God of truth.
I hated those watching vanities of falsehood, and I trusted to Jehovah.
I will rejoice and be glad in thy mercy, for thou sawest mine affliction; thou knewest my soul in straits;
And thou didst not shut me up in the hand of the enemy: thou didst cause my feet to stand in a broad place.
Pity me, O Jehovah, for straits are to me: mine eye fell away; with trouble my soul and my belly.
For my life was finished in sorrow, and my years in sighing: my strength was weak in mine iniquity, and my bones fell away.
From all mine enemies I was a reproach, and greatly to my neighbors, and a fear to those knowing me: they seeing me without fled from me.
I was forgotten as the dead from the heart: I was a vessel perishing.
For I heard the slander of many sojourning round about: in their sitting together against me they purposed to take away my soul.
And I trusted upon thee, O Jehovah: I said, Thou my God.
My times in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from those pursuing me.
Cause thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me in thy mercy.
O Jehovah, I shall not be ashamed, for I called upon thee: the unjust shall be ashamed and they shall be destroyed to hades.
The lips of falsehood shall be mute; speaking boldly in pride and contempt.
How much thy goodness which thou didst conceal for them fearing thee; thou didst work for those putting their trust in thee before the sons of man.
Thou wilt cover them in the covering of thy face from the snares of man: thou wilt conceal them in the booth from the strife of tongues.
Praised be Jehovah, for he made wonderful his mercy to me in the fortified city.
And I said in my hasty flight; I was cut off from before thine eyes: yet thou heardest the voice of my supplications in my crying to thee.
Love Jehovah, all ye his godly ones: and he watched the faithful and requiting abundantly the doing of pride.
Be strong, and he will strengthen your heart, all ye waiting for Jehovah.
To David, wisdom. Happy the taking away of transgression, the covering of sin.
Happy the man Jehovah will not reckon sin to him, and no deceit in his spirit.
If I was silent, my bones fell away in my groaning all the day.
For day and night thy hand will be heavy upon me: my moisture was turned into the dryness of summer. Silence.
I will make known to thee my sin, and mine iniquity I hid not I said, I will confess upon my transgression to Jehovah; and thou didst take away the iniquity of my sin. Silence.
For this all the godly shall pray to thee for the time of finding: only for the inundation of many waters they shall not draw near to him.
Thou a covering to me, from straits thou wilt watch me; thou wilt surround me with rejoicings of deliverance. Silence.
I will make thee wise, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel mine eyes upon thee.
Ye shall not be as the horse, as the mule, not understanding: with bit and curb to stop his youth, not drawing near to thee.
Many the sorrows to the unjust one: and he trusting in Jehovah, mercy shall surround him.
Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye just: and shout for joy, all ye upright of heart.
Rejoice, ye just, in Jehovah, praise being suitable for the upright.
Confess to Jehovah upon the harp: upon an instrument of ten strings play ye to him.
Sing to him a new song; make cheerful playing with a loud noise.
For straight the word of Jehovah, and all his work in faithfulness.
He loved justice and judgment: the earth was filled with the mercy of Jehovah.
By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.
He heaped up the waters of the sea as a mound: he gave the depths into storehouses.
All the earth shall fear from Jehovah: and of him shall all dwelling in the habitable globe be afraid.
For he said, and it shall be; he commanded, and it will stand.
Jehovah made vain the counsel of the nations: he brought the purposes of the peoples to nought.
The counsel of Jehovah shall stand forever, the purposes of his heart to generation and generation.
Happy the nation to whom Jehovah is his God; the people he chose for an inheritance to him.
Jehovah looked from the heavens; he saw all the sons of man.
From his prepared dwelling he viewed all dwelling in the earth.
He formed their heart together, understanding all their works.
The king was not saved by much strength: the strong one will not be delivered by much power.
The horse was false to salvation, and he shall not deliver by the multitude of his strength.
Behold, the eye of Jehovah upon those fearing him, upon those hoping for his mercy;
To deliver their soul from death, and to save them alive in famine.
Our soul waited for Jehovah: he our help and our shield.
For in him our heart shall rejoice, for in his holy name we trusted.
Thy mercy, O Jehovah, shall be upon us according as we hoped for thee.
To David in his changing his understanding before Abimelech; and he will drive him out, and he will go. I will praise Jehovah in all time: always his praise in my mouth.
In Jehovah my soul shall glory, the humble shall hear and rejoice.
Magnify to Jehovah with me, and we will exalt his name together.
I sought Jehovah and he answered me, and from all my fears he delivered me.
They looked to him and were bright, and their faces shall not be ashamed.
This poor one called, and Jehovah heard, and from all his straits he saved him.
Behold, the messenger of Jehovah surrounding to those fearing him, and he will deliver them.
Taste ye and see that Jehovah is good: happy the man who shall put his trust in him.
Fear Jehovah, ye his holy ones; for no want to those fearing him.
The young lions suffered want and were hungry: and they seeking Jehovah shall not want any good.
Come, ye sons, hear to me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
Who the man desiring life, loving days, to see good?
Watch thy tongue from evil; and thy lips from speaking deceit.
Turn away from evil, and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah upon the just, and his ears to their cries.
The face of Jehovah against those doing evil, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.
They cried and Jehovah heard, and he delivered them from all their straits.
Jehovah is near to the broken of heart, and he will save the humble of spirit.
Many the evils of the just one, and Jehovah will deliver him from all of them.
He watched all his bones: one of them was not broken.
Evil shall slay the unjust one: and they hating the just one shall transgress.
Jehovah redeems the soul of his servants: and all trusting in him shall not transgress.
To David. Contend, O Jehovah, with them contending with me: fight with those fighting with me.
Take hold of the shield and the buckler, and stand up for my help.
Draw out the spear, and shut up to the meeting of them pursuing me: say to my soul, I am thy salvation.
They seeking my soul shall be ashamed and disgraced: they shall be drawn back and be ashamed purposing my evil.
They shall be as chaff before the wind: and the messenger of Jehovah overthrowing.
Their way shall be darkness and slippery places, and the messenger of Jehovah pursuing them.
For gratuitously they hid for me the destruction of their net: gratuitously they dug for my soul.
Desolation shall come to him not knowing, and his net which he hid shall take him: in destruction he shall fall in it.
And my soul shall rejoice in Jehovah: it shall be glad in his salvation.
All my bones shall say, O Jehovah, who as thee, delivering the poor from him strong above him, and the poor and the needy from him stripping him?
Witnesses of wrong will rise up; they will ask me what I knew not.
They will requite me evil instead of good, bereaving to my soul.
And I, in their being sick, my clothing sackcloth: I humbled my soul in fasting, and my prayer shall be turned back upon my bosom.
As a friend, as a brother to me: I went about as mourning a mother: being darkened, I bowed down.
And in my halting they rejoiced, and they were gathered together: they smiting were gathered together against me, and I knew not; they rent asunder and ceased not:
With profane mocking parasites, gnashing their teeth against me.
O Jehovah, how long wilt thou see? Turn back my soul from their destruction, my only one from the lions.
I will praise thee in the great convocation: I will celebrate thee among a strong people.
Mine enemies shall not rejoice over me for falsehood: they hating me gratuitously shall pinch the eye.
For they will not speak peace: and against the quiet of the land they will purpose words of deceits.
They will widen their mouth upon me: they said, Aha! aha our eye saw it.
Thou sawest, O Jehovah: thou wilt not be silent: O Jehovah, thou wilt not remove far off from me.
Rouse up and awake to judgment, my God and my Lord, for my contention.
Judge me according to thy justice, O Jehovah my God, and they shall not rejoice over me.
They shall not say in their heart, Aha! our soul. They shall not say, We swallowed him down.
They shall be ashamed and they shall blush together, rejoicing for my evil: they shall be clothed with shame and reproach, magnifying against me.
Those delighting in my justice shall rejoice and be glad: they shall say always, Jehovah shall be magnified: he delighted in the peace of his servant.
My tongue shall speak of thy justice, thy praise all the day.
To the overseer, to the servant of Jehovah: to David. A song of transgression to the unjust one in the midst of my heart, no fear of God before his eyes.
For he made smooth to himself in his eyes, to find his iniquity to hate.
The words of his mouth vanity and deceit: he ceased to be circumspect, to do good.
He will purpose vanity upon his bed; he will set himself upon a way not good; he will not reject evil.
O Jehovah, thy mercy is in the heavens; thy faithfulness even to the clouds.
Thy justice as the mountains of God; thy judgments a great deep: man and cattle thou wilt save, O Jehovah.
How precious thy mercy, O God! and the sons of man shall put their trust in the shadow of thy wings.
They shall satiate from the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt give them to drink the torrent of thy delights.
For with thee the fountain of life: in thy light we shall see light.
Draw out thy mercy to those knowing thee, and thy justice to the upright of heart.
The foot of pride shall not come to me, and the hand of the unjust shall not move me.
There they working vanity fell: they were thrust down, and they shall not be able to rise.
To David. Thou shalt not be angry at those doing evil, and thou shalt not envy those working iniquity.
For as grass hastening they shall be cut down, and as the greenness of grass they shall fall away.
Trust in Jehovah and do good; dwell in the land and be fed with faithfulness.
And delight thyself upon Jehovah, and he shall give to thee the petitions of thy heart.
Roll thy way upon Jehovah, and trust upon him, and he will work.
And he brought forth as the light thy justice, and thy judgment as the noon.
Be silent to Jehovah and wait for him: thou shalt not be angry at him prospering his way, at the man doing wickednesses.
Desist from anger and forsake wrath: thou shalt not be angry only to do evil.
For they doing evil shall be cut off: and they waiting for Jehovah they shall inherit the earth.
Yet a little, and no unjust one thou didst mark upon his place, and he was not.
And the humble shall inherit the earth, and they delighted themselves for the multitude of peace.
The unjust one meditated against the just, and gnashed upon him with his teeth.
Jehovah shall laugh at him: for he saw that his day will come.
The unjust let loose the sword, and they bent their bow; they cast down the poor and needy, to slaughter the upright of way.
Their sword shall go into their heart, and their bows shall be broken.
A little to the just one is good more than the wealth of many unjust.
For the arms of the unjust shall be broken, and Jehovah upholds the just.
Jehovah will know the days of the blameless, and their inheritance shall be forever.
They shall not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
For the unjust shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah as the preciousness of lambs: they ended in smoke; they ended.
The unjust one borrowed and he will not repay: and the just one compassionated, and gave.
For they praising him shall inherit the earth, and they cursing him shall be cut off.
From Jehovah the steps of a man were prepared, and he will delight in his way.
If he shall fall he shall not be prostrated, for Jehovah will uphold his hand.
I was a youth, also I grew old, and I saw not the just one forsaken and his seed seeking bread.
All the day he compassionates and lends; and his seed to be blessed.
Depart from evil and do good, and dwell forever.
For Jehovah love's judgment, and he will not forsake his godly ones; forever they were watched, and the seed of the unjust was cut off.
The just shall inherit the earth, and they shall dwell upon it forever.
The mouth of the just one shall speak wisdom, and his tongue shall speak judgment.
The law of his God is in his heart, and his goings shall not waver.
The unjust watches for the just, and seeks to kill him,
Jehovah will not leave him in his land, and he will not condemn him in his being judged.
Wait for Jehovah and watch his way, and be will exalt thee to inherit the earth: in the cutting off the unjust thou shalt see.
I saw the unjust one making afraid, and spreading abroad as a green native tree.
And he shall pass away, and behold, he is not: and I shall seek him and he was not found.
Watch the blameless, and see the upright one, for the latter state to the man peace.
And they transgressing were destroyed together: the latter state of the unjust was cut of.
And the salvation of the just is from Jehovah: their strength in time of straits.
And Jehovah shall help them, and he will deliver them: he will deliver them from the unjust, and he will save them, for they trusted in him.
Chanting of David to bring to remembrance.
O Jehovah, thou wilt not reprove me in thy wrath, and thou wilt not correct me in thine anger.
For thine arrows came down upon me, and thy hand will press down upon me.
No soundness in my flesh from thy wrath; no peace in my bones from the face of my sins.
For mine iniquities passed over my head: as a heavy lifting up they will be loaded above me.
My stripes became loathsome: they flowed from the face of my folly.
I was moved, I was even greatly bowed down: all the day I went darkened.
For my loins were filled with inflammation, and no soundness in my flesh.
I was languid and crushed even greatly: I roared from the groaning of my heart.
O Jehovah, before thee all my desire, and my sighing was not hid from thee.
My heart moved about rapidly, my strength forsook me, and the light of mine eyes also they not with me.
My friends and my neighbors will stand from before my stroke, and my kindred stood from far off.
And they seeking my soul will lay snares: and they seeking my evil spake mischief, and they will meditate deceits all the day,
And I, as deaf, shall not hear; and as dumb, he will not open his mouth.
And I as a man that heard not, and not in his mouth confutations.
For, for thee, O Jehovah, I waited: thou wilt answer, O Jehovah my God.
For I said, Lest they shall rejoice over me: in the wavering of my foot they magnified against me.
For I being prepared for halting, and my pain always before me.
For I will announce mine iniquity: I shall be afraid for my sin.
And mine enemies living, they were strong: and they hating me with falsehood were multiplied.
And they requiting evil for good will be mine adversaries, for my pursuing Thou wilt not forsake me, O Jehovah: my God, thou wilt not remove far off from me.
Hasten for my help, O Jehovah, my salvation.
To the overseer, to Jeduthun: chanting of David. I said, I will watch my way from sinning with my tongue: I will watch for my mouth with a muzzle while yet the unjust one is before me.
I was dumb with silence, I was silent from good, and my pain was moved.
My heart was hot in the midst of me; in my heat the fire will burn: I spake with my tongue.
O Jehovah, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; I shall know how I fail.
Behold, thou gavest my days a hand-breadth, and my life as nothing before thee: but every man stood all vanity. Silence.
Surely in a shadow a man will go about: surely they will be disquieted in vain: he will store up, and he knew not who shall gather them.
And now, what waited I for, O Jehovah? my hope it is to thee.
Deliver me from all my transgression: thou wilt not set me a reproach of the foolish one.
I was dumb, I will not open my mouth; for thou didst.
Remove from me thy stroke: I was finished from the contention of thy hand.
With corrections for iniquity thou didst correct man, and thou wilt melt down as a moth his beauty: surely every man is vanity. Silence.
Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry; thou wilt not be silent at my tears, for I a sojourner with thee, a dweller, as all my fathers.
Look away from me, and I shall be cheerful, before I shall go and I not be.
To the overseer: of David chanting. Waiting, I waited for Jehovah, and he will incline to me, and he will hear my cry.
And he will bring me up from the pit of destruction, from the clay of mire, and he will set my feet upon a rock, preparing my goings.
And he will give a new song in my mouth, praise to our God: many shall see and fear, and they shall trust in Jehovah.
Happy the man who set Jehovah his trust, and turned not to the arrogant, and those turning aside to falsehood.
Many the wonders thou didst, O Jehovah my God, and thy purposes to us: none shall set in order to thee: I will announce and speak, they were numerous above number.
Sacrifice and a gift thou didst not delight in; the ears thou didst pierce to me: burnt-offering and sin thou didst not ask.
Then I said, Behold, I came: in the volume of the book it was written concerning me.
To do thine acceptance, O my God, I delighted; and thy law in the midst of my bowels.
I announced good news, justice in the great convocation: behold, my lips I will not shut up, O Jehovah, thou knewest.
I hid not thy justice within my heart; I said thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I hid not thy mercy and thy truth to the great convocation.
Thou wilt not, O Jehovah, shut up thy compassions from me: thy mercy and thy truth shall always guard me.
For evils even not being numbered encompassed about me: mine iniquities overtook me, and I was not able to see; they were numerous above the hairs of my head, and my heart forsook me.
Be gracious, O Jehovah, to deliver me: hasten, O Jehovah, to help me.
They shall be ashamed and blush together seeking my soul to take it away; they shall be turned back, and they delighting in my evil shall be ashamed.
They shall be made desolate for the reward of their shame, they saying to me, Aha! aha!
All they seeking thee shall rejoice and be glad in thee: they loving thy salvation shall say, Jehovah shall be magnified.
And I am poor and needy, Jehovah will think upon me: thou my help and my deliverer; thou will not delay, O my God.
To the overseer: chanting of David. Happy he attending to the weak one: in the day of evil Jehovah will deliver him.
Jehovah will watch him and preserve him alive; he shall be happy upon the earth, and thou wilt not give him to the soul of his enemies.
Jehovah will support him upon a bed of sickness: thou turnedst all his bed in his sickness.
I said, O Jehovah, pity me, heal my soul, for I sinned against thee.
Mine enemies will say evil to me: When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he came to see, he will speak vanity: his heart will gather vanity to him; he will go forth without; he will speak.
Together, all hating me, will whisper against me: against one they will purpose evil to me.
A word of Belial will press upon him: and when he lay down, he will not add to rise up.
Also the man of my peace whom I trusted in him, eating my bread, magnified the heel against me.
And thou, O Jehovah, pity me and raise me up, and I will requite to them.
By this I knew that thou didst delight in me, for mine enemy will not shout over me.
And I, in mine integrity thou didst support me, and thou wilt set me before thy face forever.
Praised be Jehovah God of Israel, from forever and even to forever. Amen and Amen.
To the overseer instructing for the sons of Borah. As the stag will long for the channels of waters, thus will my soul long for thee, O God.
My soul thirsted for God, for the living God: when shall I come and see the face of God?
My tears were to me bread day and night, in saying to me all the days, Where is thy God?
These I shall remember, and I shall pour out my soul in me: for I shall pass through into the booth, I shall go softly with them even to the house of God, with the voice of joy and confession, of the multitude keeping a festival.
Why wilt thou be bowed down, O my soul? and be disturbed upon me? Hope upon God, for yet shall I praise him for the salvation of his face.
O my God, my soul will be bowed down upon me: for this I will remember from the land of Jordan and the Hermonites, from the mountain of smallness.
Deep calling to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: all thy breakers and thy waves passed over me.
The day Jehovah will command his mercy, and in the night the song with me; the prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God my rock, Wherefore didst thou forget me? wherefore darkened shall I go for the oppression of the enemy?
With a breaking of my bones mine enemies reproached me, in their saying all the day, Where their God?
Why wilt thou be bowed down, O my soul? and why wilt thou be disturbed upon me? Hope upon God, for yet shall I praise him, the salvation of my face and my God.
Judge me, O God, and contend my contention from a nation not godly: from the man of deceit and iniquity thou wilt deliver me.
For thou the God of my strength: why didst thou reject me? wherefore darkened shall I go about for the oppression of the enemy?
Send forth thy light and thy truth; they shall lead me, they shall bring me to thy holy mountain and to thy tents.
I will come to the altar of God, to God the gladness of my joy: and I will praise thee upon the harp, O God, my God.
Why wilt thou be bowed down, O my soul? and why wilt thou be disturbed upon me? hope upon God, for yet shall I praise him, the salvation of my face, and my God.
To the overseer for the sons of Korah: of instruction. O God, with our ears we heard; our fathers recounted to us the work thou didst in their days, in days of old.
Thou didst with thy hand drive out the nations and thou wilt plant them; thou wilt pluck in pieces the people, and thou wilt send them forth.
For by their sword they possessed not the land, and their arm saved them not: for thy right hand and thine arm, and the light of thy face, for thou didst delight in them.
Thou art he my King, O God: command the salvation of Jacob.
In thee we will thrust our enemies: in thy name we will tread down those rising up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword will not serve me.
For thou savedst us from our enemies, and those hating us thou didst make ashamed.
In God we praised all the day, and thy name we will celebrate forever. Silence.
But thou didst reject, and thou wilt shame us, and not go forth with our armies.
Thou wilt turn us back from the enemy: and those hating us spoiled for themselves.
Thou wilt give us as sheep for food, and thou didst scatter us among the nations.
Thou wilt sell thy people without riches, and thou didst not increase by their price.
Thou wilt set us a reproach to our neighbors, and a derision and scorn to them round about us.
Thou wilt set us a parable among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
All the day my shame before me, and the confusion of my face covered me,
From the voice of him reproaching and reviling, from the face of the enemy and avenger.
All this came to us, and we did not forget thee, and we lied not in thy covenant.
Our heart drew not back, and thou wilt not incline our going from thy path;
For thou didst crush us in the place of jackals, and thou wilt cover over us with the shadow of death.
If we forgat the name of our God, and stretched out our hands to a strange god:
Will not God search this out? for he knew the secrets of the heart.
For, for thee we were killed all the day; we were reckoned as sheep of the slaughter.
Awake, why wilt thou sleep, O Jehovah? awake, thou wilt not reject forever.
Why wilt thou hide thy face? wilt thou forget our affliction and our oppression?
For our soul was bowed down to the dust: our belly was glued to the earth.
Arise a help for us, and redeem us for sake of thy mercy.
To the overseer over the lilies, for the sons of Korah, instruction: a song of the beloved. My heart boiled over a good word: I say my works to the king: my tongue the pen of one writing promptly.
Thou wert very beautiful above the sons of man: grace was poured forth by thy lips: for this God praised thee forever.
Gird thy sword upon the thigh, thou strong one in thy majesty and thine honor.
And in thy splendor prosper thou riding upon the word of truth and humility, of justice; and thy right hand shall teach thee wonderfully.
Thine arrows being sharpened peoples shall fall under thee as the heart of the king's enemies.
Thy throne, O God, forever and ever: a rod of straightness the rod of thy kingdom.
Thou lovedst justice, and thou wilt hate injustice: for this, God thy God anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy companions.
Myrrh and aloes, cassia, all thy garments, from the temples of ivory, by which they gladdened thee.
King's daughters among thy beautiful ones: the queen stood at thy right hand, in gold of Ophir.
Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father's house;
And the king shall desire for himself thy beauty, for he is thy Lord; and worship thou to him.
And the daughter of the rock with a gift; and the rich of the people shall supplicate thy face.
All glory the king's daughter, in front: her clothing textures of gold.
With variegation she shall be brought to the King; the virgins after her, her companions, being brought to thee.
They shall be brought with gladness and joy: they shall come into the temple of the king.
Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons; thou shalt set them for chiefs in all the earth.
I will cause thy name to be remembered in every generation and generation: for this the peoples shall praise thee forever and ever.
To the overseer for the sons of Korah, with the female voice: a song. O God, to us refuge and strength, helping greatly, being found in straits.
For this we will not fear in the changing of the earth, and in the moving of the mountains into the heart of the seas.
Its waters will roar, they will foam; the mountains will tremble in its pride. Silence.
A river, its streams will gladden the city of God, the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
God is in her midst, she shall not be moved: God will help her at the face of morning.
Nations raged, kingdoms were moved: he gave with his voice, the earth will melt.
Jehovah of armies is with us, the God of Jacob a height for us. Silence.
Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he set in the earth.
Causing wars to cease even to the end of the earth; he will break the bow, and be cut off the spear, and he will burn the cars in fire.
Desist, and know that I am God: I will be exalted in the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob a height for us. Silence.
To the overseer, to the son of Korah: chanting. All peoples ye shall clap the hand; shout to God with the voice of rejoicing.
For Jehovah the Most High is terrible; a great King over all the earth.
He will speak the peoples under us, and the nations under our feet.
He will choose for us our inheritance, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Silence.
God went up with a shout, Jehovah with the voice of a trumpet.
Play on the harp to God, play on the harp to our King; play on the harp.
For God is King of all the earth: play on the harp from understanding.
God reigned over the nations; God sat upon his holy throne.
The nobles of the peoples were gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham: for to God the shields of the earth: he was lifted up greatly.
A song of chanting to the sons of Korah. Great is Jehovah, and greatly praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
Fair of elevation, the joy of all the earth, is mount Zion, the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
God being known in her fortresses for a height.
For behold, the kings met together, they passed by together.
They saw, so they were astonished; they trembled, they took flight.
Trembling seized them there, pain as of her bringing forth.
With an east wind thou wilt break the ships of Tarshish.
As we heard, so we saw in the city of Jehovah of armies, in the city of our God: God will prepare it even forever. Silence.
We thought, O God, of thy mercy in the midst of thy temple.
According to thy name, O God, so thy praise upon the ends of the earth: thy right hand being full of justice.
Mount Zion shall rejoice, the daughters of Judah shall be glad for sake of thy judgments.
Surround ye Zion, and go round about her: recount her towers.
Set your hearts to her fortification; divide up her palaces, so that ye shall recount to the later generation.
For this God is our God forever and ever: he will guide us to death.
To the overseer, to the sons of Korah: chanting. Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the World:
Also ye sons of Adam, also ye sons of man together, ye rich and needy.
My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart understanding.
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my enigma upon the harp.
Wherefore shall I fear in the days of evil, the iniquity of my heel shall surround me.
They trusting upon their wealth, and they will glory in the multitude of their riches.
A man redeeming shall not redeem the brother, he shall not give to God his ransom:
(And the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceased forever:)
And he shall yet live forever, he shall not see destruction.
For he shall see the wise shall die: together the fool and the stupid one shall perish, and they left their wealth to others.
The midst of them their houses forever, their dwellings to generation and generation; they called in their names upon their lands.
And man shall not abide in honor, being like as the beasts they perished.
This their way folly to them: and those after them will delight in their mouth. Silence.
As sheep they were laid in hades; death shall rule over them, and the upright shall come down upon them in the morning; and their rock for falling away in hades from a dwelling to him.
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hades, for he will receive me. Silence.
Thou shalt not fear when a man shall be enriched, and when the honor of his house shall be increased;
For not in his dying shall he take anything: his honor shall not go down after him.
For in his living he will praise his soul, (and he will praise thee for thou wilt do good to thyself,)
It shall go even to the generation of his fathers; even forever they shall not see light.
Man in honor shall not understand; being like as the beasts, they perished.
Chanting to Asaph. The God of gods, Jehovah spake, and he will call the earth from the rising of the sun even to its going down.
Out of Zion the perfection of beauty, God shone forth.
Our God shall come, and he will not be silent: a fire shall consume before him, and it stormed greatly round about him.
He will call to the heavens from above, and to the earth to judge his people.
Gather ye my godly ones to me, they cutting out my covenant upon sacrifice.
And the heavens shall announce his justice: for God himself the judge. Silence.
Hear ye, my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God thy God.
Not for thy sacrifices will I reprove thee and for thy burnt-offerings, being always before me.
I will not take a bullock from thy house, from thy fold, he goats.
For to me all the beasts of the forest, the cattle upon a thousand mountains.
I knew all the birds of the mountains and the moving things of the field with me.
If I shall hunger I shall not say to thee; for to me the habitable globe, and its fulness.
Shall I eat the flesh of the strong ones, and shall I drink the blood of goats?
Sacrifice to God thanksgiving, and repay thy vows to the Most High:
And call upon me in the day of straits: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt honor me.
And to the unjust one God said, What to thee to recount my law, and thou wilt lift up my covenant upon thy mouth?
And thou hatedst instruction, and thou wilt cast my words behind thee.
If thou sawest a thief, and thou wilt run with him, and thy portion with those committing adultery.
Thou sentest thy month into evil, and thy tongue will contrive deceit.
Thou wilt sit, and thou wilt speak against thy brother; against the son of thy, mother thou wilt give a stumbling-block.
These things thou didst and I was silent; thou thoughtest, being, I shall be like to thee: I will reprove thee, and I will set it in order before thine eyes.
Understand now this, ye forgetting God, lest I shall rend and none delivering.
He sacrificing praise shall honor me, and he setting the way I will cause him to look upon the salvation of God.
To the overseer: chanting to David; In the coming to him of Nathan the prophet, when he went in to Bathsheba. Compassionate me, O God, according to thy mercy: according to the Multitude of thy compassions wipe away my transgressions.
Multiply to wash me from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I shall know my transgression, and my sin is always before me.
Against thee, thee alone, did I sin, and I did evil in thine eyes: so that thou wilt be justified in thy speaking, and thou wilt be pure in thy judging.
Behold, I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, thou didst delight in truth in the reins, and in bidden things thou wilt cause me to know wisdom.
Thou wilt purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: thou wilt wash me and I shall be white above snow.
Thou wilt cause me to hear joy and gladness; the bones thou didst break shall rejoice.
Hide thy face from my sin, and wipe away all mine iniquities.
Create for me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit in my midst,
Thou wilt not cast me away from thy face, and thou wilt not take thy holy spirit from me.
Turn back to me the joy of thy salvation, and thy willing spirit shall uphold me.
I will teach those transgressing, thy ways, and those sinning shall turn back to thee.
Deliver me from bloods, O God the God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in thy justice.
O Jehovah, thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall announce thy praise.
For thou wilt not delight in sacrifice, and thou wilt not take pleasure in burnt-offering.
The sacrifices of God a spirit being broken: a heart being broken and crushed, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Do Zion good in thy good will: thou wilt build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then wilt thou delight in sacrifices of justice, in burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: then they will bring up bullocks upon thine altar.

To the overseer upon the stringed instrument: instruction to David. The fool said in his heart, No God. They were corrupted; they made iniquity abominable: none doing good.
God from the heavens looked forth upon the sons of man to see if there is he understanding, seeking God.
They all drew back: together they were corrupt; none doing good, not even one.
Did not those transgressing know any thing? eating up my people, they ate bread: they called not upon God.
They feared a fear; there was no fear: for God scattered the bones of him making narrow: thou didst make ashamed, for God rejected them.
Who will give from Zion the salvation of Israel? In God turning back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument, instruction to David: In the going of the Ziphims, and they will say to Saul, Is not David hiding with us? O God, in thy name save me, and in thy strength thou wilt judge me.
O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the sayings of my mouth.
For strangers rose up against me, and the powerful sought out my soul: they set not God before them. Silence.
Behold, God a help to me: Jehovah with those upholding my soul.
He will turn back the evil to those oppressing me; in thy truth cut them off.
In willingness I will sacrifice to thee: I will praise thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For from all straits he delivered me, and mine eyes looked upon my enemies.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument, instruction to David. Give ear O God, to my prayer; thou wilt not hide thyself from my supplication.
Attend to me and answer me; I shall flow down and make a noise in my complaint.
From the voice of the enemy, from the face of the oppression of the unjust one: for they will bring down vanity upon me, for in anger they will lie in wait for me.
My heart will be pained within me, and the terrors of death fell upon me.
Fear and trembling will come upon me, and horror will cover me.
And saying, Who will give me the wing-feather as a dove? I will fly away and settle down.
Behold, I will move far off; fleeing away I will lodge in the desert. Silence.
I will hasten escape to me from the rushing wind, from the storm.
Swallow up, O Jehovah, divide their tongue: for I saw violence and strife in the city.
Day and night they will surround it upon its walls: and vanity and trouble in her midst.
Mischief in her midst: oppression and deceit will not depart from her wide place.
For not the enemy will reproach me, and I will bear: not he hating me magnified against me; and I will hide from him.
And thou a man according to my estimation, my friend and my acquaintance.
Who together made sweet the intercourse, we will go into the house of God with the multitude.
Death shall lay waste upon them; they shall go down living to hades, for evils in their sojournings in the midst of them.
I will call upon God, and Jehovah will save me:
Evening and morning and noon I will meditate and make a noise, and he will hear my voice.
He redeemed my soul in peace from the encounter against me: for with many they were with me.
God will hear and he will humble them, and he dwelt of old. Silence. With whom no changes to them and they feared not God.
He stretched forth his hand in his recompenses: he profaned his covenant.
They were divided from the wrath of his mouth, and his heart drew near: his words were soft above oil, and they drawn swords.
Cast thy giving upon Jehovah and he will sustain thee: he will not give forever a wavering to the just one.
And thou, O God, wilt bring them down to the well of destruction: men of bloods and deceit shall not halve their days; and I will trust in thee.
To the overseer for the silent dove of those far off: to David, a poem in the rovers taking him in Gath. Compassionate me, O God, for man panted after me; warring all the day, he will press me.
Mine enemies panted after me all the day: for many warring against me proudly.
The day I shall be afraid I will trust to thee.
In God I will praise his word, in God I trusted; I will not fear what flesh shall do to me.
All the day they will grieve my words: against me all their purposes for evil.
They will sojourn, they will hide, they will watch my heels as they waited for my soul.
For nothing is deliverance to them? In anger bring down the peoples, O God.
Thou didst recount my wanderings: set thou my tears in thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
Then will mine enemies turn back in the day I shall call: this I knew, that God is for me.
In God I will praise the word: in Jehovah I will praise the word.
In God I trusted, I will not fear what man shall do to me.
Upon me, O God, thy vows: I will repay praises to thee.
For thou deliveredst my soul from death: are not my feet from falling, to go about before God in the light of the living?
To the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy, to David a poem in his fleeing from the face of Saul in the cave. Compassionate me, O God, compassionate me: for in thee my soul put trust, and in the shadow of thy wings I will put my trust till calamity shall pass by.
I will call to God the Most High; to God he completed for me.
He will send from the heavens and he will save me; he rebuked him panting after me. Silence. God will send forth his mercy and his truth.
My soul is in the midst of lions: I shall lie down with the flaming, the sons of man, their teeth spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; above all the earth thy glory.
They prepared a net for my steps; my soul was bent down: they dug a pit before me, they fell into the midst of it. Silence.
My heart was prepared, O God, my heart was prepared: I will sing and play on the harp.
Awake, my glory; awake, lyre and harp: I shall awake early.
I will praise thee, O Jehovah, among the peoples: I will play on the harp to thee among the nations.
For great even to the heavens thy mercy, and even to the clouds, thy truth.
Be thou exalted over the heavens, O God: over all the earth, thy glory.
To the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy; to David a poem. Will ye indeed speak dumb justice? will ye judge justly, ye sons of man?
Also in heart ye will work evil; in the earth ye will roll the violence of your hands.
The unjust turned aside from the belly: they went astray from the womb, speaking falsehood.
Wrath to them according to the likeness of the wrath of a serpent: as the deaf adder will stop its ear;
Which will not hear to the voice of enchanters, charming with enchantments from wisdom.
God destroyed their teeth in their mouth: Jehovah broke down the young lions grinders.
They shall melt away as water shall go about to them: he will bend his arrow, they shall be as cut off.
As a snail shall melt away he shall go: fire fell; they saw not the sun.
Before your pots shall perceive the thorn, as living, as in wrath, he will sweep him away.
The just one shall rejoice as seeing vengeance: he shall wash his footsteps in the blood of the unjust one.
And man shall say, Truly, fruit to the just one: truly there is a God judging in the earth.
To the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy, to David a poem; in Saul sending, and they will watch the house to kill him. Deliver me from mine enemies, O God: thou wilt set me on high from those rising up against me.
Deliver me from those working vanity, and save me from men of bloods.
For behold, they lay in wait for my soul: the strong will gather against me; not my transgression and not my sin, O Jehovah.
Not iniquity, they will run and they will prepare: be aroused to meet me, and see.
And thou Jehovah God of armies, God of Israel, awake to review all the nations: thou wilt not compassionate all covering iniquity. Silence.
They will turn back at evening: they will make a noise as a dog, and they will surround the city.
Behold, they will gush out with their mouth: swords in their lips: for who heard?
And thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; thou wilt deride at all the nations.
His strength for thee will I watch: for God my height.
My God, his mercy shall anticipate me: God shall cause me to look upon mine enemies.
Thou wilt not kill them lest my people shall forget: cause them to wander to and fro by thy strength, and bring them down, O Jehovah, our shield.
The sin of their mouth the word of their lips, and they shall be taken in their pride: and from cursing and from falsehood they will recount.
Finish in wrath, finish, and they not be: and they knew that God ruled in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Silence.
They shall turn back at evening; they shall make a noise as a dog, and they will surround the city.
They shall wander to and fro to eat, though they shall not be satisfied; and they will pass the night.
And I will sing thy strength; and I will rejoice at morning for thy mercy; for they wert a height to me, and a refuge in the day of straits to me.
My help, to thee I will play on the harp, for God my height, the God of my mercy.
To the overseer upon the lily of song: poem to David to teach; In the setting on fire Aram of the two rivers, and Aram of the station; and Joab will turn back and strike Edom in the valley of salt, twelve thousand. O God, thou didst cast us off, thou didst break us down, thou wert angry; wilt thou turn back to us?
Thou didst shake the earth; thou didst rend it: heal its breakings, for it is depressed.
Thou didst cause thy people to see a hard thing: thou didst give us to drink the wine of reeling.
Thou gavest a signal to those fearing thee, to flee from the face of the bow. Silence.
So that thy beloved ones shall be delivered, save with thy right hand and answer us.
God spake in his holy place; I will rejoice, I will divide the shoulder, and I will measure the valley of booths.
Gilead to me, and Manasseh to me; and Ephraim the strength of my head; Judah my judge.
Moab the pot of my washing; over Edom I will cast out my shoe: for me, Philistia shouted for joy.
Who will bring me to the city of fortification? who guided me even to Edom?
Wilt not thou, O God? thou didst cast us off, and wilt thou not go forth, O God, with our armies?
Give to us help from straits, for vain the salvation of man.
In God we will do strength and he will tread down our adversaries.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument; to David. Hear, O God, my wailing; attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will call to thee, in the fainting of my heart: thou wilt lead me into the rock it will be lifted up above me.
For thou wert a refuge to me, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tent forever: I will put my trust in the covering of thy wings. Silence.
For thou, O God, heartiest to my vows: thou gavest the inheritance to those fearing thy name.
Thou wilt add days to the days of the king: his years as generation and generation.
He shall dwell before God forever: mercy and truth a portion shall guard him.
Thus will I play on the harp to thy name forever, to repay me my vows day by day.
To the overseer, to Jeduthun: chanting to David. Surely my soul was silent to God: from him my salvation.
Surely he my rock and my salvation, my height; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye set upon a man? ye will kill all of you: as a wall inclining, a wall thrust down.
Surely they counseled to thrust down his lifting up: they will delight in falsehood: with their mouth they will praise, and in their inward parts they will curse. Silence.
Only, my soul be thou silent to God; for from him my hope.
Surely he my rock and my salvation: my height; I shall not be moved.
Upon God my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, my refuge in God.
Trust in him in all time; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Silence.
Surely the sons of man vanity, the sons of man falsehood: to be brought up into the balances, they together of vanity.
Ye shall not trust in oppression, ye shall not become vain in plunder: if wealth shall increase ye shall not set the heart.
Once God spake; twice I heard this; that strength is to God.
And to thee, O Jehovah, mercy: for thou wilt recompense to each according to his work.
Chanting to David in his being in the desert of Judah. O God thou art my God; I will seek thee: my soul thirsted for thee, my flesh longed for thee in a land of dryness, and thirsty without water.
Thus in the holy place I saw thee, to see thy strength and thy glory.
For thy mercy was good more than life; my lips shall praise thee.
So I will bless thee in my life: in thy name will I lift up my hands.
As milk and fatness my soul shall be satisfied; and with rejoicing lips shall my mouth praise.
When I remembered thee upon my bed in the watches, I will meditate upon thee.
For thou wert a help to me, and in the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice.
My soul adhered after thee: thy right hand held fast upon me.
They will seek my soul for destruction, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall deliver to the hands of the sword; they shall be a portion of foxes.
And the king shall rejoice in God; all swearing in him shall glory: for the mouth of those speaking falsehood shall be stopped.
To the overseer; chanting to David. Hear, O God, my voice in my complaint: thou wilt guard my life from the fear of the enemy.
Thou wilt cover me from the consultation of evil ones; from the crowd of the workers of vanity:
Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, they bent their arrows a bitter word:
To shoot down the blameless one in secret things: suddenly they will shoot, and they will not be afraid.
They will strengthen to themselves an evil word: they will recount to hide snares; they said, Who shall see them.
They will search out iniquities; they completed a search searched out: and a man drew near, and a deep heart.
God shall be exalted; their blows were the arrow of the simple.
And they will cause their tongue to falter upon themselves: all looking upon them shall be moved.
And all men shall fear, and they shall announce the work of God: and they shall look at his doing.
The just one shall rejoice in Jehovah, and he put his trust in him; and all the upright of heart shall glory.
To the overseer; chanting to David a song. Praise being silent to thee, O God in Zion: and to thee shall the vow be repaid.
Hear thou prayer: even to thee shall all flesh come.
The words of iniquities were strong above me: our transgressions thou wilt cover them.
Happy him thou wilt choose, and thou wilt draw near; he shall dwell in thy enclosures: we shall be satisfied in the good of thy house; holy is thy temple.
Wonderful things in justice thou wilt answer us, O God saving us, the trust of all the ends of the earth, and those being far off upon the sea:
Preparing the mountains in his strength; being girded with might:
Restraining the tumult of the seas, the tumult of their waves, and the multitude of the nations.
And they shall be afraid, those dwelling in the ends, from thy signs: the goings forth of the morning and evening thou wilt cause to rejoice.
Thou reviewedst the earth, and thou wilt water it: thou wilt greatly enrich it; the stream of God being full of waters: thou wilt prepare their grain, for so thou wilt prepare it.
Thou givest its furrows to drink to the full: thou wilt cause its incisions to flow down in showers: thou wilt bless its springing up.
Thou crownest the year of thy goodness, and thy tracks shall drop fatness.
The pastures of the desert shall drop, and the hills shall be girded with joy.
The lambs of the sheep were clothed, and the valleys shall be covered with corn; they shall shout for joy, they shall also sing.
To the overseer; a song of chanting. Shout ye for joy to God, all the earth:
Play ye on the harp, the glory of his name: set the glory of his praise.
Say to God, How terrible thy works! in the multitude of thy strength thine enemies shall lie to thee.
All the earth shall worship to thee, and they shall play on the harp to thee; they shall play on the harp to thy name. Silence.
Come and see ye the works of God: terrible the doing upon the sons of man.
He turned the sea into dry land: they will pass through the river on foot: there we shall rejoice in him.
Ruling by his strength forever; his eyes will look about upon the nations: they turning away shall not lift up for themselves. Silence.
Ye peoples bless our God, and cause the voice of his praise to be heard.
He set our soul in life, and he gave not our feet to waver.
For thou didst try us, O God, thou didst prove us as purifying of silver.
Thou broughtest us into the net; thou didst set a heavy burden upon our loins.
Thou didst cause men to ride upon our head; we went through fire and through water: and thou wilt bring us forth to abundance.
I will go into thine house with burnt-offerings: I will repay to thee my vows,
Which my lips opened and my month spake in straits to me.
I will bring up to thee burnt-offerings of marrows with incense of rams; I will do oxen with he goats. Silence.
Come, hear, and I will recount, all ye fearing God, what he did for my soul.
I called to him with my mouth, and he was lifted up under my tongue.
If I saw vanity in my heart, Jehovah will not hear.
Surely God heard; he attended upon the voice of my prayer.
Praised be God who turned not away my prayer, and his mercy from me.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument: chanting of the song. God will compassionate us and bless us; his face will enlighten us. Silence.
To know thy way in the earth, thy salvation among all the nations.
The peoples shall praise thee, O God; the peoples shall praise thee, all of them.
The nations shall be glad and rejoice, for thou wilt judge peoples in uprightness, and thou wilt pity the nations upon earth. Silence.
Peoples shall praise thee, O God; peoples shall praise thee, all of them.
The earth gave her produce; God our God shall bless Us.
God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
To the overseer; to David chanting of a song. God will rise; his enemies shall be scattered, and they hating him shall flee from his face.
As smoke being dispersed thou wilt disperse: as wax melting from the face of fire, the unjust shall perish from the face of God.
And the just shall be glad; they shall rejoice before God, and they shall rejoice with gladness.
Sing ye to God; play on the harp to his name: raise him up to ride in the evenings, in Jah his name, and rejoice before him.
A father of orphans and a judge of widows, God in his holy habitation.
God setting the only ones in the house, bringing forth the bound into prosperities, but those turning away dwelt in a dry land.
O God, in thy going forth before thy people, in thy stepping in the desert. Silence.
The earth shook, also the heavens dropped from the face of God, this Sinai from the face of God, the God of Israel.
Thou wilt scatter a rain of abundance, O God, to thine inheritance, and being weary thou didst make it firm.
Thy living ones dwelt in it: thou wilt prepare in thy goodness for the poor, O God.
Jehovah will give the word: to those announcing good news a great army.
Kings of armies will flee away, they will flee away, and she resting in the house will divide the spoil.
If ye shall lie down within the stalls, the wings of the dove being covered with silver, and her wing feathers with yellowness of gold.
In the Almighty scattering kings in it, it shall be snow white in Salmon.
The mountain of God the mountain of Basilan; the mountain of height the mountain of Bashan.
Wherefore will ye lie in wait, ye mountains of heights? the mountain God desired to dwell in it: also Jehovah will dwell forever.
The chariot of God twice ten thousand thousands upon thousands: Jehovah among them, Sinai in the holy place.
Thou didst go up to height, thou didst take captive captivity: thou didst receive gifts in man, also those turning away, for Jehovah God to dwell.
Praised be Jehovah; day by day the God of our salvation will lift up to us. Silence.
The God to us a God for salvations; and to Jehovah the Lord the goings forth to death.
Also God will crush the head of his enemies, the crown of him going about in his faults.
Jehovah said, I will turn back from Bashan; I will turn back from the depths of the sea:
So that thy foot shall shake in blood, the tongue of thy dogs from the enemies of him.
They saw thy goings, O God; the goings of my God, my King, in the holy place.
The chiefs went before, they playing on instruments, after; in the midst, girls beating the tabret.
Praise ye God in the assemblies, Jehovah from the fountain of Israel.
Then little Benjamin in a deep sleep, the chiefs of Judah their throng, the chiefs of Zebulon, the chiefs of Naphtali.
Thy God commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, this thou didst for us.
From thy temple at Jerusalem kings shall bring a gift to thee.
Rebuke the beasts of the reed, the assembly of the strong ones, with the heifers of the peoples, prostrating themselves with pieces of silver: scatter the peoples, they will delight in wars.
The rich shall come out of Egypt; Cush shall cause its hand to run to God.
Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; play on the harp to Jehovah. Silence.
To him riding upon the heavens of heavens of old, behold, he will give in his voice a voice of strength.
Ye shall give strength to God: upon Israel is his majesty, and his strength in the clouds.
O God, being wonderful in thy holy things: the God of Israel, he gave strength and powers to the people. Praised be God.
To the overseer upon the lilies; to David. Save me, O God, for the waters came even to the soul.
I sank in mire of depth, and no standing: I came into depths of waters and the floods overwhelmed me.
I was wearied in my calling, my throat was dried up: mine eyes failed waiting for my God.
Those hating me were many above the hairs of my head: mine enemies destroying me by falsehood were strong: then I will turn back what I plucked not away.
O God, thou knewest for my folly, and my faults were not hid from thee.
They waiting for thee shall not be ashamed for me: O Lord Jehovah of armies, they shall not be disgraced for me, seeking thee, O God of Israel.
Because for thee I bare reproach: shame covered my face.
I was polluted to my brethren, and a stranger to my mother's sons.
For the zeal of thy house devoured me, and the reproaches of those reproaching thee fell upon me.
And I will weep with fasting of my soul, and it will be for reproaches to me.
And I will give my clothing sackcloth, and I for a parable to them.
They sitting in the gate will speak against me, and I was but the music of stringed instruments, of strong drink.
And I, my prayer is to thee, O Jehovah, a time of acceptance: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy answer me, in the truth of thy salvation.
Deliver me from the mire and I shall not sink: I shall be delivered from those hating me, and from the depths of waters.
The streams of water shall not overflow me, and the depth shall not swallow me down, and the well shall not close upon me her mouth.
Answer me, O Jehovah, for good is thy mercy: according to the multitude of thy compassions turn to me.
And thou wilt not hide thy face from thy servant; for straits are to me: hasten to answer me.
Draw near to my soul, redeem it: ransom me on account of mine enemies.
Thou knewest my reproach and my shame, and my disgrace: all mine adversaries are before thee.
Reproach broke my heart, and I shall be ill at ease: and I shall hope for comforting, and none; and for those consoling, and I found not.
And they will give my food poison, and for my thirst they will give me vinegar to drink.
Their table shall be before them for a snare, for a retribution, for a cause of ruin.
Their eyes shall be darkened from seeing, and cause their loins to waver always.
Pour out upon them thy wrath, and the burning of thins anger shall overtake then).
Their fortress shall be desolated, and in their tents there shall none be dwelling.
For whom thou didst strike they pursued; and they will relate to the pain of thy wounded.
Thou wilt give iniquity to their iniquity, and they shall not come into thy justice.
They shall be wiped off from the book of the living, and with the just they shall not be written.
And I am poor and dejected: and thy salvation, O God, shall set me up on high.
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with praise.
And it shall be good to Jehovah above an ox, a bullock shooting out horns and hoofs,
The poor saw, they shall be glad: and seeking Jehovah your heart shall live.
For Jehovah heard to the needy, and he despised not his hound.
The heavens shall praise him, and the earth, the sea, and every creeping thing in it.
For God will save Zion, and he will build the cities of Judah, and they shall dwell there and inherit it.
And the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they loving his name shall dwell in it.
To the overseer: to David, to bring to remembrance. O God, to deliver me; O Jehovah hasten to help me.
They seeking my soul shall be confused and ashamed: they shall be turned away behind; and they desiring my evils, shall be ashamed.
They shall be turned back for a reward of their shame, saying, Aha! Aha.
All seeking thee shall rejoice and be glad in thee, and they shall say always, God shall be magnified; they loving thy salvation.
And I am poor and needy: O God, hasten to me, my help and my deliverer; thou, O Jehovah, wilt not delay.
In thee, O Jehovah, I put my trust; shall not be ashamed forever.
In thy justice thou wilt deliver me, and let me escape: incline to me thine ear and save me.
Be thou to me for a rock of refuge to come always: thou didst command to save me, for thou my rock and my fortress.
My God, deliver me from the hand of the unjust one, from the hand of him transgressing, and the violent one.
For thou my hope, O Lord Jehovah: my trust from my youth.
Upon thee was I supported from the womb: from the bowels of my mother thou didst separate me: in thee my praise always.
I was as a wonder to many: and thou my refuge of strength.
My mouth shall be filled with thy praise, thy magnificence all the day.
Thou wilt not cast me off to the time of old age; as my strength fails thou wilt not forsake me.
For mine enemies said to me, and they watching my soul took counsel together,
Saying, God forsook him: pursue him and take him, for none delivering.
O God, thou wilt not be far off from me: my God, hasten for my help.
They lying in wait for my soul shall be ashamed; they shall be finished; they seeking my evil shall be covered with reproach and shame.
And I will always hope, and I added upon all thy praise.
My mouth shall recount thy justice, all the day thy salvation, for I knew not numbers.
I will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah: I will keep in remembrance thy justice, thine alone.
O God, thou didst teach me from my youth: and even to this will I announce thy wonders.
And also even to old age and grayness, O God, thou wilt not forsake me; till I shall announce thine arm to the generation, thy strength to every one who shall come:
And thy justice, O God, even to height, who didst great things: O God, who like thee?
Who didst cause us to see great straits and evils; thou wilt turn back, thou wilt preserve us alive, and from the depths of the earth thou wilt turn back, thou wilt bring us up.
Thou wilt increase my greatness, thou wilt surround me, thou wilt comfort me.
Also I will praise thee with the instrument of the harp; thy truth, O God, I will play on the harp, to thee, O Thou, Holy One of Israel.
My lips shall rejoice when I shall play on the harp to thee, and my soul which thou redeemedst.
Also my tongue all the day shall celebrate thy justice; for they were confused, for they seeking my evil were ashamed.
To Solomon. O God, thou wilt give thy judgments to the king, and thy justice to the king's son.
He shall judge thy people in justice, and thy poor in judgment.
The mountains shall lift up peace to the people, and the hills in justice.
He shall judge the poor of the people, and save to the sons of the needy, and he will break in pieces him oppressing.
And they shall fear thee with the sun and before the moon, generation of generations.
He shall come down as rain upon a fleece, as showers of pouring rain upon the earth.
The just one shall break forth in his days, and a multitude of peace even till no moon.
And he shall rule from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.
Inhabitants of the desert shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and the islands shall turn back a gift, the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring a present.
And all kings shall worship to him: all nations shall serve him.
For we will deliver the needy from the powerful one, and the poor and no helper to him.
He will spare for the poor and the needy, and he will save the souls of the needy.
From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul, and their blood shall be precious in his eyes.
And he shall live, and there shall be given to him from the gold of Sheba: and there shall always be supplications for him; all the day shall they praise him.
There shall be diffusion of grain in the earth upon the head of the mountains; its fruit shall shake as Lebanon, and they shall blossom from the city as the grass of the earth.
His name shall be forever: his name shall flourish before the sun: and they shall be praised in him: all nations shall pronounce him happy.
Praised be Jehovah God, the God of Israel, doing wonders himself alone.
And praised be the name of his glory forever; and his glory shall fill all the earth. Amen and Amen.
The prayers of David son of Jesse were completed.
Chanting to Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to the clean of heart.
And I, my feet nearly turned aside; my going was almost poured out.
For I was envious at the foolish; I shall see the peace of the unjust.
For not the pains to their death, and their body fat.
They are not in the trouble of men, and with man they shall not be struck.
For this, pride surrounded them as a neck-chain; the dress of violence will cover to them.
Their eye will come forth from fat: they passed over the imaginations of the heart.
They will mock and speak in evil of oppression: they will speak from elevation.
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue will go in the earth.
For this, his people will turn back here: and full water shall be sucked out to them.
And they said, How did God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
Behold, these the unjust, and they being secure of the world increased riches.
Surely in vain I cleansed my heart, and I will wash my hands in cleanness.
And I am struck all the day, and my reproofs for the mornings.
If I said, I will recount thus; behold, I transgressed against the generation of thy sons.
And I shall think to know this, it is labor in mine eyes.
Till I shall come to the holy place of God I shall not understand for their latter state.
Surely in slippery places thou wilt set them, to cast them down into ruins.
How they were for desolation as in a moment they perished; they were finished from sudden destruction.
As a dream of him awaking, O Jehovah, in awaking thou wilt despise their image.
For my heart will be embittered, and my loins were hard.
And I stupid, and I shall not know, and I was a beast with thee.
And I always with thee: thou didst hold by my right hand.
In thy counsel thou wilt guide me, and after, thou wilt receive me with glory.
Who to me in the heavens? and from thee I desired nothing in the earth.
My flesh failed and my heart: the rock of my heart and my portion is God forever.
For behold, they being far off from thee shall perish: thou didst lay waste all committing fornication from thee.
And I drawing near to God, it is good for me: I put in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, to recount all thy works.
Understanding to Asaph. Wherefore, O God, didst thou reject forever? will thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy feeding?
Remember thine assembly thou didst purchase of old; thou didst redeem the rod of thine inheritance; this mount Zion thou didst dwell in it.
Lift up thy steps to desolations forever; all the evil of the enemy in the holy place.
Thine enemies roared in the midst of thine appointment; they set their signs, signs.
It will be known according to bringing the axes upwards upon the thicket of wood.
And now with axes and hammers they will beat her engravings.
They cast thy holy place into fire, to the earth they defiled the tent of thy name.
They said in their heart, We will rage against them together: they burnt up all the appointments of God in the earth.
We saw not our signs, no more a prophet: and not with us will it be known how long.
How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? Shall the enemy despise thy name forever?
Wherefore wilt thou turn back thy hand, and thy right hand? from the midst of thy bosom completely.
And God my king of old working salvations in the midst of the earth.
Thou didst cleave the sea in thy strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons upon the waters.
Thou didst break the heads of the sea monster, thou wilt give him for food to the people, to the inhabitants of the desert.
Thou didst cleave asunder the fountain and the torrent: thou driedst up the rivers of strength.
To thee the day, also to thee the night: thou didst prepare the light and the sun.
Thou didst set all the bounds of the earth: summer and autumn thou didst form them.
Remember this, the enemy reproached Jehovah, and the foolish people despised thy name.
Thou wilt not give the soul of thy turtle-dove to the beast: the life of thy poor thou wilt not forget forever.
Look to thy covenant: for the dark places of the earth were filled with habitations of violence.
The poor one shall not turn back ashamed: the humble and the needy shall praise thy name.
Arise, O God, contend thy contention: remember thy reproach from the foolish all the day.
Thou wilt not forget the voice of thine adversaries: the pride of them rising up against thee going up always.
To the overseer, Thou wilt not destroy: chanting to Asaph a song. We confessed to thee, O God, we confessed: and thy name is near, thy wonders recounted.
For I will take the appointment, I will judge uprightnesses.
The earth and all dwelling in it being melted: I made even its pillars. Silence.
I said to the foolish, Ye shall not be foolish; and to the unjust, Ye shall not lift up the horn:
Ye shall not lift up your horn to elevation: ye will speak with an impudent neck.
For not from the going forth and from the west, and not from the desert the lifting up.
For God is judge: he will humble this, and this he will lift up.
For a cup in the hand of Jehovah, and the wine red, being full of mixed wine; and he will pour out from this: but its lees all the unjust of the earth shall suck out, they shall drink.
And I will announce forever; I will play on the harp to the God of Jacob.
And all the horns of the unjust will I cut off; the horns of the just one shall be exalted.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument: chanting to Asaph song. In Judah was God known: great his name in Israel.
And his booth shall be in peace, and his dwelling in Zion.
There he broke the lightnings of the bow, the shield and the sword, and war. Silence.
Thou art light, being magnified from the mountains of fresh foliage.
The mighty of heart were spoiled, they slumbered their sleep: and all the men of strength found not their hands.
From thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, the chariot and the horse lay in a deep sleep.
Thou art feared, thou: and who shall stand before thee from the time of thine anger?
From the heavens thou didst cause judgment to be heard; the earth feared and rested.
In God's rising up to judgment, to save all the poor of the earth. Silence.
For the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath thou wilt gird up.
Vow, ye, and repay to Jehovah your God: all being round about him shall bring a gift for fear.
He will cut off the spirit of leaders, being terrible to the kings of the earth.
To the overseer for Jeduthun: to Asaph a chanting. My voice to God, and I will cry with my voice to God, and he gave ear to me.
In the day of my straits I sought Jehovah: my hand was stretched out at night, and it will not be slack: my soul refused to be comforted.
I will remember God and I shall be disquieted: I shall be depressed and my spirit will languish. Silence.
Thou didst hold mine eyes watching: I was moved, and I will not speak.
I reckoned the days of old, the everlasting years.
I will remember my stringed instruments in the night: I shall meditate with my heart, and my spirit will search out.
Will Jehovah reject forever? and will he no more add to be satisfied?
Did his mercy fail forever? his word come to an end to generation and generation?
Did God forget to compassionate? or in anger did he gather his compassion? Silence.
And saying, This has made me sick: the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will remember the works of Jah: for I will remember the ancient time of thy wonder.
And I meditated in all thy work, and I will think upon all thy doings.
O God, thy way is in the holy place: what God great as God?
Thou the God doing wonder: thou didst make known thy strength among the peoples.
Thou didst redeem with the arm thy people the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Silence.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they will tremble, also the depths will be moved.
The clouds poured out waters: the clouds gave a voice: also thine arrows will go about.
The voice of thy thunder in the wheel: the lightnings lightened the habitable globe: the earth moved and it will shake.
In the sea thy way, and thy paths in many waters, and thy heels were not known.
Thou didst guide thy people as sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Instruction to Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the sayings of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter enigmas from ancient time:
Which we heard and we shall know them, and our fathers recounted to us.
It was not hid from their sons, to a later generation recounting the praises of Jehovah and his strength, and his wonders which he did.
For he raised up a testimony in Jacob and set a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to make them known to their sons:
So that a later generation shall know; sons shall be born, they shall rise up and recount to their sons.
And they shall set their hope in God, and they shall not forget the works of God, and they shall watch his commands.
And they shall not be as their fathers, a generation turning away and bitter, a generation it prepared not its heart, and its spirit was not firm with God.
The sons of Ephraim bending, lifting up the bow, turned in the day of the encounter.
They watched not the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to go;
And they will forget his works and his wonders which he caused them to see.
Before their fathers he did a wonder in the land of Egypt, the field of loading.
He rent the sea and he will cause them to pass through; and he will cause the waters to stand as a heap.
And he will guide them in a cloud the day, and all the night in a light of fire.
He will rend the rocks in the desert, and give drink as the great abyss.
And he will bring forth flowings from the rock, and bring down waters as rivers.
And they will yet add to sin against him to embitter the Most High in a dry land.
And they will tempt God in their heart to ask food for their soul.
And they will speak against God; they said, Will God be able to arrange a table in the desert?
Behold, he struck the rock and waters will flow, and torrents will pour out; will he be able also to give bread? or will he prepare flesh for his people?
For this Jehovah heard and he will overflow, and a fire was kindled in Jacob, and also anger came up upon Israel.
For they believed not in God, and they trusted not in his salvation.
And he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of the heavens.
And he will rain upon them manna to eat, and he gave the grain of the heavens to them.
Man ate the bread of the strong: he sent to them provision to fulness.
He will cause the east wind to go forth in the heavens, and by his strength he will lead the south wind.
And he will rain flesh upon them as the dust, birds of feather as the sand of the seas.
And it shall fall in the midst of his camp, round about to his habitations.
And they shall eat and be well filled: and he will bring to them their desire.
They turned not away from their desire, yet their food in their mouth.
And the anger of God came up upon them, and he will slay among their fat ones and he bowed down the chosen of Israel.
In all this they yet sinned, and they believed not in his wonders.
And he will finish their days in vanity, and their years in terror.
When he slew them and they sought him, and they turned back and sought for God.
And they will remember that God is their Rock, and God the Most High redeemed them.
And they will deceive with their mouth, and with their tongue they will lie to him.
And their heart was not right with him, and they were not firm in his covenant.
And he being compassionate will cover iniquity, and he will not destroy: and he multiplied to turn back his anger, and he will not rouse up all his wrath.
And he will remember that they are flesh; a spirit going and not turning back.
How often they will embitter him in the desert! they will grieve him in the waste.
And they will turn back and tempt God, and they broke in upon the Holy One of Israel.
They remembered not his hand the day which he redeemed them from the enemy;
How he set in Egypt his signs, and his wonders in the field of loading.
And he turned to blood their rivers, and their flowings they shall not drink.
He will send forth among them the gad-fly, and they shall devour them; and frogs, and they shall destroy them.
And he will give their produce to the devourer, and their labor to the locust.
He will kill their vine with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
He will deliver their cattle to the hail, and their possessions to the flames.
He will send upon them the burning of his anger, outpouring and wrath, and straits, sending evil messengers.
He will prepare a beaten path for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, and their life he delivered to the word;
And he will strike all the firstborn in Egypt; the first-fruits of their toils in the tents of Ham:
He will remove his people as sheep, and he will lead them as a flock in the desert.
And he will guide them securely and they feared not: and the sea covered their enemies.
And he will bring them to the bound of his holy place, this mountain his right hand purchased.
And he will cast out the nations from their face, and he will divide them by lot in the measure of inheritance, and he will cause the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
And they will tempt and embitter God the Most High, and they watched not his testimonies.
And they will draw back, and they will transgress as their fathers: they were turned as a bow of deceit.
And they will make him angry with their heights, and they will provoke him to jealousy with their carved images.
God heard and he will overflow, and he will greatly contemn in Israel.
And he cast off the tent of Shiloh, the tent he pitched among man.
And he will give his strength to captivity, and his beauty into the hand of the enemy.
And he will deliver his people to the sword, and he overflowed upon his inheritance.
The fire devoured his young men, and his virgins wailed not.
His priests fell by the sword, and his widows wept not.
And Jehovah will awake as he sleeping, as the strong one shouting from wine.
And he will strike his enemies behind: he gave to them reproach forever.
And he will reject in the tent of Joseph, and he chose not in the tribe of Ephraim.
And be will choose the tribe of Judah, mount Zion which he loved.
And he will build his holy place as of buffaloes, as the earth he founded it forever.
And he will choose in David his servant, and he will take him from the folds of sheep.
From those bringing up to care for Jacob his people and for Israel his inheritance.
And he will feed them according to the integrity of his heart, and he will guide them in the understandings of his hands.
Chanting to Asaph. O God, the nations came into thine inheritance; they defiled thy holy temple; they set Jerusalem for ruins.
They gave the corpses of thy servants food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of thy godly ones to the beasts of the earth.
They poured out their blood as water round about Jerusalem; and none burying.
We were a reproach to our neighbors, a derision and scorn to those being round about us.
How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry forever? shall thy jealousy burn as fire?
Pour out thy wrath upon the nations which knew thee not, and upon the kingdoms which called not upon thy name.
For devouring Jacob and they laid Waste his dwelling.
Thou wilt not remember against us former iniquities: thy compassions shall quickly anticipate us, for we were greatly weak:
Help us, O God; save us, for the word of the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and cover our sins for sake of thy name.
Wherefore shall the nations say, Where is their God? He will make known among the nations before our eyes the vengeance of the blood of thy servants being poured out.
The mourning of the bound shall come before thee; according to the greatness of thine arm let the sons of death remain.
And turn back to our neighbors seven fold to their bosom their reproach which they reproached thee, O Jehovah.
And we are thy people and the sheep of thy pasture: we will confess to thee forever: to generation and generation we will recount thy praise.
To the overseer for the lilies of the testimonies; to Asaph a chanting. O thou feeding Israel, give ear, guiding Joseph as sheep; thou dwelling in the cherubs, shine forth.
Before Epraim and Benjamin add Manasseh raise up thy strength, and come to save for us.
O God, turn us back and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved:
O Jehovah, God of armies, how long didst thou smoke against the prayer of thy people?
Thou gavest them to eat the bread of tears, and thou wilt give them to drink in tears by measure.
Thou wilt set us a strife to our neighbors, and our enemies will deride to themselves.
O God of armies, turn us back and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
Thou wilt remove a vine from Egypt: thou wilt cast out the nations and thou wilt plant it.
Thou didst set in order before it, and thou wilt cause its roots to take root and the earth will be filled.
Its Shadow covered the mountains, and its branches the cedars of God.
Thou Wilt send forth her boughs even to the sea, and her suckers to the river.
Wherefore didst thou break down her walls, and all passing by the way plucked her?
The swine from the forest will lay it waste, and the Moving thing of the field will feed upon it.
O God of armies, turn back now: look from the heavens and see, and review this vine;
And the plant which thy right hand planted, and upon the son thou madest strong for thee,
Burning it in fire, cutting it down; from the rebuke of thy face they shall perish.
Thy hand shall be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man thou madest Strong for thee.
And we will not draw back from thee: thou wilt cause us to live, and we will call upon thy name.
O Jehovah, God of armies turn us back; cause thy face to shine, and We shall be saved.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument; to Asaph. Rejoice ye in God our strength: shout to the God of Jacob.
Lift up music, and ye shall give the drum, the pleasant harp, with the lyre.
Strike ye the trumpet in the new in the full moon, for the day of our festival.
For it is a law to Israel, a judgment to the God of Jacob.
He set him a testimony in Joseph in his going forth upon the land of Egypt: I shall hear a lip I knew not.
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands shall past by from the basket.
Thou calledst in straits, and I will deliver thee; I will answer thee in the hiding place of thunder. I will prove thee at the water of strife. Silence.
Hear, O my people, and I will testify in thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hear to me;
A strange god shall not be in thee; and thou shalt not worship to a strange god.
I am Jehovah thy God bringing thee up from the land of Egypt: make broad thy mouth and I will fill it.
And my people heard not to my voice; and Israel was not inclined to me.
And I will send him forth in the hardnesses of their heart: they shall go in their counsels.
Would that my people heard to me! Israel shall go in my ways.
Shortly I shall humble their enemies, and against their adversaries I will turn back my hand.
They hating Jehovah shall lie to him: and their time shall be forever.
And he shall cause them to eat from the fat of wheat, and from the rock with honey will I satisfy thee.
Chanting to Asaph. God stood in the assembly of God; he will judge in the midst of gods.
How long will ye judge wickedness, and ye will lift up the faces of the unjust? Silence.
Judge ye the poor one, and the orphan: do justice to the humble one and the poor one.
Deliver the poor and needy one: take away out of the hand of the unjust.
They will not know, they will not Understand: they will go about in darkness: all the foundations of the earth will be moved.
I said, Ye are gods; and the sons of the Most High all of you.
But as man shall ye die, and as one of the chiefs shall ye fall.
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for then shalt inherit in all nations.
A song of chanting to Asaph. O God, not stillness to thee: thou wilt not be silent, and thou wilt not rest, O God.
For behold, thine enemies will be clamorous; and they hating thee lifted up the head.
Against thy people they will make crafty consultation, and they will counsel against thy hidden ones.
They said, Come, and we will cut them off from a nation; and the name of Israel shall no more be remembered.
For they counseled together with the heart: they will cut out a covenant against thee:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarites.
Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; the rovers with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Also Assur was joined with them: they were an arm to the sons of Lot Silence.
Do to them as Midian, as Sisera, as Jabin, at the torrent Bison:
They were destroyed at the fountain of the dwelling: they were dung to the earth.
Set them their nobles as Oreb, and as Zeeb: and as Zebah and as Zalmunna, all their princes:
Who said, We will inherit for us the dwellings of God.
O my God, set them as a wheel; as straw before the wind.
As fire will burn the forest, and as the flame will cause the mountains to burn.
So wilt thou pursue them with thy tempest, and thou wilt terrify them with thy whirlwind:
Fill their face with contempt, and they shall seek thy name, O Jehovah.
They shall be ashamed and terrified, even to forever; and they shall be put to shame and perish.
And they shall know that thou, thy name Jehovah alone, the Most High over all the earth.
To the overseer upon the stringed instrument: to the sons of Korah, a chanting. How beloved are thy tents, O Jehovah of armies!
My soul longed after, and also failed for the enclosures of Jehovah: my heart and my flesh will rejoice for the living God.
Also the sparrow found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself where she put her young brood, thine altars, O Jehovah of armies, my King and my God.
Happy they dwelling in thy house; they shall yet praise thee. Silence.
Happy the man strength to him in thee; the raised ways in their heart;
Passing through in the valley of Baca they will set it a fountain; also the early rain will cover the ponds.
They will go from strength to strength, being seen in Zion to God.
O Jehovah God of armies, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Silence.
See, O God our shield, and behold the face of thy Messiah.
For good a day in thine enclosures above a thousand. I chose to wait on the threshold in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of injustice.
For Jehovah God a sun and shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory; he will not withhold good to those going uprightly.
O Jehovah of armies, happy the man trusting in thee.
To the overseer: to the sons of Korah a chanting. O Jehovah, thou didst delight in thy land: thou didst turn back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou didst lift up the iniquity of thy people, thou didst cover all their sin. Silence.
Thou didst take away all thy wrath: thou didst turn back the burning of thine anger.
Turn us back, O God of our salvation, and annul thine anger with us.
Wilt thou be angry with us forever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to generation and generation?
Wilt thou not turn back? wilt thou give us life? and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
Cause us, O Jehovah, to see thy mercy, and thou wilt give to us thy salvation.
I will hear what God Jehovah shall speak: for he will speak peace to his people, and to his godly ones: and they shall not turn back to folly.
Surely his salvation is near to those fearing him, for glory to dwell in his land.
Mercy and truth met together; justice and peace kissed.
Truth will spring up from the earth, and justice looked forth from the heavens.
Also Jehovah will give good, and our land shall give her produce.
Justice shall go before him, and shall set to the way of his steps.
A prayer to David. Incline, O Jehovah, thine ear: answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Watch my soul, for I am godly: save thy servant, thou my God, trusting in thee.
Compassionate me, O Jehovah, for to thee I will call all the day.
Rejoice the soul of thy servant, for to thee, O Jehovah, will I lift up my soul.
For thou, O Jehovah, art good and forgiving, and great of mercy to all calling to thee.
Give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer, and attend upon the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my straits I will call thee, for thou wilt answer me.
None like to thee among the gods, O Jehovah, and none according to thy works.
All the nations which thou madest shall come and worship before thee, O Jehovah, and they shall do honor to thy name.
For great art thou, and doing wonders: thou God alone.
Teach me, O Jehovah, thy way; I will go in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
I will praise thee, O Jehovah, my God, with all my heart, and I will honor thy name forever.
For thy mercy is great upon me, and thou didst deliver my soul from hades below.
O God, the proud rose up against me, and the assemblies of the terrible sought my soul; and they set not thee before them.
And thou, O Jehovah, art a God compassionate and merciful, and slow to anger and great of mercy and truth.
Turn to me and pity me; thou wilt give thy strength to thy servant, and save to the son of thy maid-servant.
Make with me a sign for good, and they hating me shall see and be ashamed: for thou, Jehovah, didst help me and comfort me.
To the sons of Korah chanting a song. His foundations are in the mountains of holiness.
Jehovah loved the gates of Zion above all the tents of Jacob.
Honored things being spoken in thee, O city of God. Silence.
I will make mention of Rahab and Babel to those knowing me: behold the rovers, and Tyre, with Cush; this was born there.
And to Zion a man will say, And a man was born in her: and he the Most High shall prepare her.
Jehovah shall recount in writing up the peoples, This was born there. Silence.
The chiefs according to them beginning: all my fountains in thee.
A song of chanting to the sons of Korah to the overseer upon the lute, for affliction of instruction, for Heman the Ezrabite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, the day have I cried in the night before thee.
My prayer shall come before thee: incline thine ear to my wailing;
For my soul was filled with evils, and my life touched upon hades.
I was reckoned with those going down to the pit: I was as a man of no strength:
Free among the dead, as they wounded lying down in the grave, whom thou no more didst remember them, and they were cut off by thy hand.
Thou didst set me in the pit beneath, in darknesses, in the shades.
Thy wrath lay upon me, and thou didst afflict with all thy breakers. Silence.
Thou didst remove far from me mine acquaintance; thou didst set me an abomination to them: I was shut up, and I shall not go forth.
Mine eye languished from affliction: I called to thee, O Jehovah, in all the day, I stretched my hands to thee.
Wilt thou do wonder to the dead? if the shades shall arise, shall they praise thee? Silence.
Shall thy mercy be recounted in the grave, thy faithfulness in destruction?
Shall thy wonder be known in darkness, and thy justice in a land of oblivion?
And to thee, O Jehovah, I cried, and in the morning shall my prayer anticipate thee.
Wherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou cast off my soul? wilt thou hide thy face from me?
I am poor and expiring from youth: I bore thy terrors; I shall be perplexed.
Upon me thy burnings passed over; thy terrors made me silent.
They surrounded me as water all the day; they folded round about me together.
Thou didst remove far from me lover and friend, mine acquaintance into darkness.
Of instruction to Ethan the Ezrahite. The mercies of Jehovah forever will I sing: to generation and generation will I make known thy faithfulness with my mouth.
For I said, Mercy shall be built up forever: the heavens, thy faithfulness shall be prepared in them.
I cut out a covenant to my chosen, I sware to David my servant,
Even to forever I will prepare thy seed, and I built up to generation and generation thy throne, Silence.
And the heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Jehovah, also thy faithfulness in the convocation of the holy ones.
For who in the cloud shall be compared to Jehovah? shall he be likened to Jehovah among the sons of God?
God being greatly terrible in the council of the holy ones and to be feared by all round about him.
O Jehovah, God of armies, who as thee, Jah, strong? and thy faithfulness round about thee?
Thou ruling over the lifting up of the sea: in the lifting up of its waves thou wilt soothe them.
Thou didst break Rahab in pieces as the wounded one; with the arm of thy strength thou didst scatter thine enemies.
To thee the heavens, also to thee the earth; the habitable globe and its fulness thou didst found them.
The north and the south thou didst create them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
To thee an arm with strength: thou wilt strengthen thy hand, and thou wilt lift up thy right hand.
Justice and judgment the preparing of thy throne: mercy and truth shall anticipate thy face.
Happy the people knowing the shout of joy: O Jehovah, they shall go in the light of thy face.
In thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted.
For thou the beauty of their strength, and in thine acceptance our horn shall be exalted.
For to Jehovah our shield, and to the Holy One of Israel our King.
Then thou spakest in a vision to thy godly one, and thou wilt say, I put help upon the mighty one; I exalted the chosen one from the people.
I found David my servant; with my holy oil I anointed him:
Which my hand shall be prepared with him: also shall mine arm strengthen him.
The enemy shall not impose upon him, and the son of iniquity shall not afflict him.
And I beat down his adversaries from his fame, and I will smite those hating him.
And my faithfulness and my mercy with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
And I set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
He shall call me, Thou my father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation,
Also I will give him the firstborn, the highest to the kings of the earth.
Forever will I watch my mercy to him, and my covenant was firm to him.
I set his seed forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
If his sons shall forsake my law, and not go in my judgments;
If they shall profane my laws and watch not my commands;
And I reviewed their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with blows.
And my mercy I will not rend from him, and I will not lie in my faithfulness,
I will not profane my covenant, and I will not change the going forth of my lips.
Once did I swear in my holy place if I shall lie to David.
His seed shall be forever and his throne as the sun before me.
As the moon it shall be prepared forever, and a faithful witness in the cloud. Silence.
And thou didst cast off, and thou wilt reject; thou didst overflow with thy Messiah.
Thou didst reject the covenant of thy servant: thou didst profane to the earth his consecration.
Thou didst break down all his walls; thou didst set his fortifications a ruin.
All those passing over the way plundered him: he was a reproach to his neighbors:
Thou didst raise up the right hand of his adversaries; thou didst cause all his enemies to rejoice.
Also thou wilt turn hack the edge of his sword, and thou caused him not to rise up in war.
Thou didst cause to cease from his cleansing, and his throne thou didst cast it down to the earth.
Thou didst shorten the clays of his youth: thou didst cover over him with shame. Silence.
How long, O Jehovah, wilt thou hide thyself forever? Shall thy wrath burn as fire?
Remember me what is life: wherefore in vain didst thou create all the sons of man?
What man shall live and not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of hades? Silence.
Where thy former mercies, O Jehovah, thou didst sware to David in thy faithfulness?
Remember, O Jehovah, the reproach of thy servants; I lifted up in my bosom all the multitudes of peoples;
Which thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah; which they reproached the heels of thy Messiah.
Blessed be Jehovah forever. Amen and Amen.
Prayer to Moses the man of God. O Jehovah, thou wert a refuge to us in generation and generation.
Before the mountains were born, and the earth shall be begun, and the habitable globe, and from forever even to forever, thou art God.
Thou wilt turn man even to crushing, and thou wilt say, Turn back, ye sons of man.
For a thousand years in thine eyes as the day of yesterday, for it shall pass away, and watches in the night.
Thou didst overwhelm them; in sleep shall they be; in the morning as the grass will pass away.
In the morning it will flourish, and it will pass away at evening; it will be cut off and will dry up.
For we were finished in thine Anger, and in thy wrath we were terrified.
Thou didst set our iniquities before thee, our hidden things before the light of thy face.
For all our days turned away in thy wrath: we finished our years as a meditation.
The days of our years, in them seventy years; and if in strengths, eighty years, and their pride labor and vanity; for being soon cut off and we shall fly away.
Who shall know the strength of thine anger? and according to thy fear, thy wrath.
To number our days so make known, and we shall bring the heart to wisdom.
Turn back, O Jehovah, how long? and have pity upon thy servants.
Satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy, and we shall rejoice and be glad in all our days.
We rejoiced according to the days thou didst humble us, the years we saw evil.
Cause thy works to be seen to thy servants, and thine honor for their sons.
And the sweetness of Jehovah our God shall be upon us: and the work of our hands prepare thou it upon us; and the work of our hands prepare thou it.
He dwelling in the covering of the Most High, in the shadow of the Almighty shall he lodge.
Saying to Jehovah, My refuge and my fortress: my God, I will trust in thee.
For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, from the word of ruin.
He will cover thee with his wing feathers, and under his wings thou shalt trust: his truth a shield and buckler.
Thou Shalt not be afraid from terror the night; from the arrow that will fly the day;
From the word that shall go in darkness: from the cutting off that shall lay waste the noon-day.
A thousand shall fall from thy side, and ten thousand from thy right hand; and to thee it shall not reach.
Only with thine eyes thou shalt look and thou shalt see the retribution of the unjust.
For thou, O Jehovah, my trust; thou didst set the Most High thy refuge.
Evil shall not approach to thee, and a blow shall not come near in thy tent.
For he will command his messengers for thee, to watch thee in all thy ways.
Upon the hands shall they lift thee up, lest thou shalt strike thy foot against a stone.
Upon the lion and the asp, shalt thou tread: thou shalt tread down the young lion and the dragon.
For he delighted in me and I will deliver him: I will exalt him, for he knew my name.
He shall call me and I will answer him: I am with him in straits; I will deliver him and honor him.
With length of days will I satisfy him, and I will cause him to look upon my salvation.
Chanting a song to the day of Sabbath. It is good to confess to Jehovah, to play on the harp to thy name, O Most High.
To announce in the morning thy mercy, and thy faithfulness in the night.
Upon a ten stringed instrument, and upon the lyre; with the murmurs upon the harp.
For thou didst gladden me, O Jehovah, by thy work: I will rejoice in the works of thy hands.
How great were thy works, O Jehovah! thy thoughts were very deep.
A brutish man shall not know, and a fool shall not understand this.
In the putting forth of the unjust as grass, and all working iniquity shall flourish; to destroy them even to forever:
And thou being high, O Jehovah, forever.
For behold, thine enemies, O Jehovah, for behold, thine enemies shall perish; all working iniquity shall be dispersed.
My horn shall be lifted up as a buffalo: I was poured over with fresh oil.
And mine eye shall look upon mine enemies: in the risings up of the unjust against me, mine ears shall hear.
The just one shall flourish as the palm tree: he shall become great as the cedar in Lebanon.
Those being planted in the house of Jehovah, shall flourish in the enclosures of our God.
They shall yet sprout in old as; they shall be fat and green.
To announce that Jehovah is upright: my rock and no iniquity in him.
Jehovah reigned, he put on majesty: Jehovah put on strength, he girded himself: also the habitable globe shall be prepared, it shall not be moved.
Thy throne was prepared from then: thou art from forever.
The rivers lifted up, O Jehovah, the rivers lifted up their voice, the rivers shall lift up their roarings.
Jehovah on high is great above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea.
Thy testimonies were very firm: holiness was becoming to thy house, O Jehovah, to length of days.
O God of vengeance, O Jehovah God of vengeance, shine forth.
Be thou lifted up judging the earth: turn back retribution upon the proud.
How long shall the unjust, O Jehovah, how long shall the unjust exult?
They will utter, they will speak impudently; all they working iniquity will boast themselves.
They will break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, and they will afflict thine inheritance.
The widow and the stranger they will slay, and they will kill the orphan.
And they will say Jah will not see, and the God of Jacob will not understand.
Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye foolish, when will ye understand?
He planting the ear, shall he not hear? if he formed the eye, shall he not see?
He chastising the nations, shall he not do justice? he teaching man knowledge.
Jehovah knew the thoughts of man that they are vanity.
Happy the man whom thou shalt chastise, O Jah: and thou wilt teach him from thy laws.
To give rest to him from the days of evil, till the pit shall be dug for the unjust.
For Jehovah will not cast off his people, and he will not forsake his inheritance.
For judgment shall turn back even to justice: and after it all the upright of heart.
Who shall rise up for me against those doing evil? who shall stand for me against those working iniquity?
Unless Jehovah helped for me my soul almost dwelt silently.
If I said, My foot wavered; thy mercy, O Jehovah, upheld me.
In the multitude of my thoughts in my midst thy consolations will delight my soul.
Shall the throne of mischief be joined together with thee forming labor upon the law?
They shall break in upon the soul of the just one, and they shall condemn innocent blood.
And Jehovah shall be for a height to me, and my God for the rock of my refuge.
And he will turn back upon them their iniquity, and in their evil he will cut them off; Jehovah our God will cut them off.
Come, we will rejoice to Jehovah: we will shout to the Rock saving us.
We will anticipate his face with confession, with music we will shout to him.
For Jehovah is the great God, and a great King over all gods.
For in his hand the recesses of the earth, and the heights of the mountains to him.
For to him the sea, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
Come, we will worship and bow down before Jehovah: he made us.
For he is our God, and we the people of his feeding and the sheep of his hand. This day if ye will, hear to his voice.
Ye shall not harden your heart as the strife, as the day of trial in the desert:
When your fathers tempted me, they proved me; also they saw my works.
Forty years I shall loathe to the generation, and saying, A people they wandering in heart, and they knew not my ways:
For I sware in mine anger if they shall come in to my rest.
Sing ye to Jehovah a new song: sing ye to Jehovah all the earth.
Sing ye to Jehovah, praise his name; announce glad tidings; from day to day, his salvation.
Recount his glory among the nations, his wonders among all peoples.
For great is Jehovah, and being greatly praised: he is terrible above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are nothings: and Jehovah made the heavens:
Majesty and honor are before him; strength and beauty in his holy place.
Give to Jehovah, ye families of the peoples, give to Jehovah glory and strength.
Give to Jehovah the glory of his name: lift ye up a gift and come to his enclosures.
Worship ye to Jehovah in the ornaments of holiness: tremble ye from his face, all the earth.
Say ye among the nations, Jehovah reigned: also the habitable globe shall be prepared, it shall not be moved: he will judge the peoples in uprightness.
The heavens shall be glad, and the earth shall rejoice: the sea shall be moved, and its fulness.
The field shall exult and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the, forest rejoice.
Before the face of Jehovah; for he came, for he came to judge the earth: he will judge the habitable globe in justice, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
Jehovah reigned, the earth shall exult: the many islands shall be glad.
A cloud and darkness round about him: justice and judgment the preparing of his throne.
Fire shall go before him and shall burn up his enemies round about.
His lightnings lightened the habitable globe; the earth saw and it Will tremble.
The mountains melted as wax from before the face of Jehovah, from before the face of the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens announced his justice, and all peoples saw his glory.
All serving a carved thing shall be ashamed, they boasting themselves in nothings; worship to him, all ye Gods.
Zion heard and she will be glad, and the daughters of Judah shall rejoice for sake of thy judgments, O Jehovah.
For thou, Jehovah, art most high over all the earth: thou wert exalted greatly above all gods.
Hate evil, ye loving Jehovah: he watched the souls of his godly ones; he will deliver them from the hand of the unjust.
Light was sown for the just one, and gladness for the upright of heart.
Be glad ye just, in Jehovah, and praise him at the remembrance of his holiness.
Chanting. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, for he did wonders: his right hand saved for him, and his holy arm.
Jehovah made known his salvation: to the eyes of the nations he uncovered his justice.
He remembered his mercy and his faithfulness to the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth saw the salvation of our God.
Shout ye to Jehovah, all the earth break forth into joy and rejoice, and play on the harp.
Play to Jehovah on the harp, on the harp and the voice of music.
With trumpets and the voice of the, horn, shout ye before the King, Jehovah.
The sea shall he moved and its fulness: the habitable globe and they dwelling in it.
The rivers shall clap the hand: the mountains shall rejoice together.
Before Jehovah; for he came to judge the earth: he will judge the habitable globe in justice, and the peoples in uprightness.
Jehovah reigned, the peoples shall be moved: he dwelling in the cherubs; the earth shall quake.
Jehovah is great in Zion, and he was raised up over all peoples.
They shall praise thy great and terrible name: he is holy.
And the king's strength loved judgment; thou didst prepare uprightnesses, thou didst judgment and justice in Jacob.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at the footstool of his feet; he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those calling upon his name; calling to Jehovah and he will answer them.
In a pillar of cloud he will speak to them: they watched his testimonies, and the law he gave them.
O Jehovah our God, thou didst answer them; thou wert God lifting up to them, and taking vengeance for all their doings.
Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for Jehovah our God is holy.
Chanting for praise. Shout ye to Jehovah, all the earth.
Serve ye Jehovah with gladness: come before him with rejoicing.
Know ye that Jehovah he is God: he made us and not we his people and the sheep of his feeding.
Come ye into his gates with confession, his enclosures with praise: confess ye to him, praise his name.
For Jehovah is good; his mercy forever and his faithfulness to generation and generation.
To David a chanting. Mercy and judgment will I sing to thee, O Jehovah: I will play on the harp.
I will be prudent in a blameless way. When wilt thou come to me? I will go about in integrity of heart in the midst of my house.
I will not set a word of Belial before mine eyes: I hated him doing transgressions; he shall not cleave to me.
A heart of oppression shall depart from me: I shall not know evil.
Slandering his neighbor in secret, him will I cut off: him being lofty of eyes and broad of heart, with him I will not eat.
Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the earth, to dwell with me: he walking in a blameless way, he shall serve me.
He doing deceit shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he speaking falsehoods shall not be prepared before mine eyes.
For the mornings I will destroy all the unjust of the land; to cut off from the city of Jehovah all doing iniquity.
Prayer for the poor when he shall languish, and before Jehovah shall pour out his complaint O Jehovah, hear my prayer, and my cry shall come to thee.
Thou wilt not hide thy face from me in the day of straits to me; incline thine ear to me: in the day I shall call, speedily answer me.
For my days were finished in smoke, and my bones burnt as fuel.
My heart was struck and dried up as grass, that I forget eating my bread.
From the voice of my groaning my bone did cleave to my flesh.
I was like to the pelican of the desert: I was as the owl of the dry places.
I watched and I shall be as the sparrow being alone upon the roof.
All the day mine enemies reproached me, they praising me aware against me.
For I ate ashes as bread, and I mingled my drink with weeping.
From the face of thine anger and thy wrath: for thou didst lift me up and thou wilt cast me down.
My days declining as a shadow, and I shall be dried up as grass.
And thou, O Jehovah, wilt remain forever; and thy remembrance to generation And generation.
Thou wilt arise, thou wilt compassionate Zion: for the time to compassionate her for the appointment came.
For thy servants delighted in her stones, and they will compassionate her dust.
And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah: and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
For Jehovah built Zion, he was seen in his glory.
He looked upon the prayer of the helpless, and he despised not their prayer.
This shall be written for a later generation: and a people created shall praise Jah.
For be looked forth from the height of his holy place; from the heavens Jehovah looked upon the earth;
To hear the groaning of the bound; to loose the sons of death.
To recount in Zion the name of Jehovah, and his praise in Jerusalem.
In the gathering of the peoples together, and the kingdoms to serve Jehovah.
He answered in the way of his strength: he shortened my days.
Saying, O my God, thou wilt not take me away in the half of my days: thy years in generations of generations.
Before time thou didst found the earth, and the heavens the work of thy hands.
They shall perish and thou shalt stand. And all they shall fall away as a garment; as clothing thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.
And thou the same, and thy years shall not finish.
The sons of thy servants shall abide, and their seed shall be prepared before thee.
To David. Praise Jehovah, O my soul, and all within me, his holy name.
Praise Jehovah, O my soul, and thou wilt not forget all his acts.
Forgiving to all thine iniquity, healing to all thy diseases.
Redeeming thy life from corruption, crowning thee with mercy and compassions.
Satisfying even to thee with good; thy youth shall be renewed as the eagle.
Jehovah did justices and judgments to all being oppressed.
He will make known his ways to Moses, his doings to the sons of Israel.
Jehovah being compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and great of mercy.
He will not contend forever; he will not keep forever.
He did not to us according to our sins, and he did not recompense upon us according to our iniquities.
For as the height of the heavens above the earth, his mercy prevailed upon those fearing him.
As far off as the sunrisings from the west, he removed far from us our transgressions.
As a father compassionating over his sons, Jehovah compassionated those fearing him.
For he knew our formation; he remembered that we are dust.
Man, his days as grass: as the blossom of the field, thus he will flourish.
For the wind passed over upon it and it is not; and its place shall know it no more.
And the mercy of Jehovah is from forever even to forever upon those fearing him, and his justice to sons' sons.
To those watching his covenant, and to those remembering his charges to do them.
Jehovah prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruled over all.
Praise Jehovah, ye his messengers mighty of strength, doing his word, to hear the voice of his word.
Praise Jehovah, all ye his armies; his servants doing his will.
Praise Jehovah all ye his works in all places of his dominions: praise Jehovah, O my soul.
Praise Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God thou wert great exceedingly; thou didst put on strength and honor:
Being covered with light as a garment: stretching forth the heavens as a curtain:
Framing his upper chambers in the waters: setting the clouds his chariot: going upon the wings of the wind.
Making his messengers spirits; his servants a fire of flame:
Founding the earth upon her bases, she shall not be moved forever and even.
The deep thou coveredst it as a garment: the waters will stand upon the mountains.
From thy rebuke they shall flee; from the voice of thy thunder they shall be terrified.
They shall go up the mountains; they shall go down into the valleys to the place: this thou didst found for them.
Thou didst set a bound they shall not pass over; they shall not turn bark to cover the earth.
Sending forth fountains into the valleys, they will go between the mountains.
They shall water all the beasts of the field: the wild asses shall break their thirst.
Upon them the birds of the heavens shall dwell, from between their boughs they shall give a voice.
Watering the mountains from his upper chambers: with the fruit of thy work shall the earth be filled.
Causing grass to spring up for the cattle, and the green herb for the service of man, to bring forth bread from the earth:
And wine will gladden the heart of man, to cause the face to shine from oil, and bread will support the heart of man.
And the trees of Jehovah shall be satisfied; the cedars of Lebanon which he planted;
Where there the sparrows will nest: the stork, the cypresses her house.
The high mountains for the wild goats; the rocks a refuge for the conies.
He made the moon for the appointments: the sun knew his going down.
Thou didst set darkness and it will be night: in it all the beasts of the forest shall creep.
The young lions roaring for prey, and to seek from God their food.
The sun shall rise, they will be gathered together, and in their dens they will lie down.
Man will go forth to his work, and to his labor even to evening.
How thy works were multiplied. O Jehovah! in wisdom thou madest them all: the earth was filled with thy possessions.
This great and broad sea, hands there of the creeping thing, and no number of the beasts, small with great.
There the ships will go: the sea monster thou didst form to play in it.
They will all wait for thee to give their food in its time.
Thou wilt give to them, they will gather up: thou wilt open thy hand, they will be filled with good.
Thou wilt hide thy face, they will tremble: thou wilt take away their spirit, they shall expire and turn back to dust.
Thou wilt send forth thy spirit, they will be created: thou wilt renew the face of the earth.
The glory of Jehovah shall be forever: Jehovah, shall rejoice in his works.
Looking upon the earth and it will tremble: he will touch up the mountains and they will smoke.
I will sing to Jehovah in my living: I will play on the harp to my God in my enduring.
My meditating upon him shall be sweet: I will rejoice in Jehovah.
Sinners shall be finished from the earth, and the unjust no more. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
Confess to Jehovah, call upon his name: make ye known his doings among the peoples.
Sing ye to him and play on the harp to him: discourse ye upon all his wonders.
Boast ye in his holy name: the heart of those seeking Jehovah shall rejoice.
Seek ye Jehovah and his strength: seek his face always.
Remember his wonders which he did; his signs and the judgments of his mouth.
The seed of Abraham his servant, the sons of Jacob his chosen.
He is Jehovah our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
He remembered his covenant forever, the word he commanded to a thousand generations.
Which he cut out with Abraham, and his oath to Isaak.
And he will set it for a law to Jacob, to Israel an eternal covenant:
Saying, To thee will give the land of Canaan, the line of your inheritance:
In their being men of number, as few and strangers in it.
And they will go about from nation to nation, from the kingdom to another people;
He permitted not a man to oppress them, and for them he will reprove kings.
Ye shall not touch upon my Messiah, and ye shall not do evil to my prophets.
And he will call a famine upon the land: he broke all the support of bread.
He sent a man before them, Joseph, for a servant was he sold:
They humbled his feet with the fetter: his soul came into iron:
Even to the time his word came: the sayings of Jehovah purified him.
The king sent and he will bring him down; the ruler of the peoples, and he will loose him.
He set him lord to his house, and ruler over all his possessions:
To bind his chiefs in his soul, and to make his old men wise.
And Israel will come into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
And he will make his people fruitful greatly, and he will strengthen him above his enemies.
He turned their heart to hate his people, to act deceitfully with his servants.
He sent Moses his servant; Aaron whom he chose in him.
They set the words of his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and he will darken; and they embittered not his words.
He turned their waters to blood, and he will slay their fish.
Their land abounded with frogs in the chambers of their kings.
He said, and the gad-fly will come, and gnats in all their bounds.
He gave their rain hail, a fire of flames in their land.
And he will strike their vine and their fig trees, and he will break the tree of their bound.
He said, and the locust will come and the feeder, and no number.
And it will devour all the of their land, and it will devour all the fruit of their earth.
And he will strike every first-born in their land, the first-fruits to all their strength.
And he will bring them forth with silver and gold, and none being weak in their tribes.
Egypt was glad in their going forth, for their fear fell upon them.
He spread a cloud for covering, and fire to lighten the night.
Asking, and he will bring the quail, and he will fill them with the bread of the heavens.
He opened the rock and the waters will flow; they went in dry places a river.
For he remembered his holy word with Abraham his servant.
And he will bring forth his people in joy, his chosen in rejoicing.
And he will give to them the lands of the nations, and they will inherit the labor of the people;
So that they shall watch his laws, and his instructions they shall observe. Praise ye Jah.
Praise Jah. Confess to Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy is forever.
Who shall speak the powers of Jehovah? will he cause all his praises to be heard?
Happy they watching judgment, doing justice in all time.
Remember us, O Jehovah: thy people with acceptance: review us with thy salvation;
To see the goodness of thy chosen ones, to be glad in the gladness of thy nation, to boast with thine inheritance.
We sinned with our fathers, we acted perversely, we did evil.
Our fathers considered not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; they embittered at the sea, the sea of sedge;
And he will save them for sake of his name, to make known his powers.
And he will rebuke in the sea of sedge, and it will be dried up: and he will lead them in the depths as the desert.
And he will save them from the hand of him hating, and he will redeem them from the hand of the enemy.
And the waters will cover their enemies: one of them was not left.
And they will believe in his words, they will sing his praise.
They hastened; they forget his works; they waited not for his counsel.
And they will desire a desire in the desert, and they will tempt God in the waste.
And he will give to them their asking; and he will send leanness into their soul.
And they will be jealous against Moses in the camp, against Aaron the holy of Jehovah.
The earth will open and will swallow down Dathan, and will cover the assembly of Abiram.
And a fire will be kindled in their assembly; the flame will burn up the unjust.
They will make a calf in Horeb, and they will worship to the molten image.
And they will change their glory into the likeness of an ox eating grass.
They forgat God saving them, doing great things in Egypt.
Wonders in the land of Ham, terrible things in the sea of sedge.
And he will say to destroy them unless Moses his chosen stood in the breaking before him to turn away his wrath from destroying.
And they will despise in the land of desire; they trusted not to his word:
And they will murmur in their tents; they heard not to the voice of Jehovah.
And he will lift up his hand against them: he will cause them to fall in the desert:
And to cause their seed to fall among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
And they will be bound to Baalpeor, and they will eat the sacrifices of the dead.
And they will irritate in their doings, and the blow will break upon them.
And Phinehas will stand and intercede, and the blow will be restrained.
And it will be reckoned to him for justice to generation and generation, even to forever.
And they will anger him at the water of strife, and it will be evil to Moses on account of them:
For they embittered his spirit, and he talked idly with his lips.
They did not destroy the peoples which Jehovah said to them.
And they will mingle with the nations, and they will learn their works.
And they will serve their images, and they will be for a snare to them.
And they will sacrifice their sons and their daughters to lords.
And they will pour out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters which they sacrificed to the images of Canaan: and the land will be polluted with bloods.
And they will be defiled with their works: and they will commit fornication in their doings.
And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against his people, and he will abhor his inheritance.
And he will give them into the hand of the nations; and they hating them shall rule over them.
And their enemies will press them, and they shall be humbled under their hand.
Many times he will deliver them, and they will embitter with their counsel, and they will be brought low in their iniquity.
And he will look upon straits to them in his hearing their wailing.
And he will remember his covenant to them, and he will console according to the multitude of his mercy.
And he will give them for compassions before all those carrying them away captive.
Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations to confess to thy holy name, to boast in thy praise.
Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from forever and even to forever: and all the people saying, Amen. Praise ye Jah.
Confess ye to Jehovah, for he is good, his mercy is forever.
They being redeemed of Jehovah shall say, Which he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
And he gathered them from the lands, from the sunrisings and from the west, from the north and from the sea.
They will wander in the desert in a waste; the way of a city of dwelling they found not.
Hungering, also thirsting, their soul will faint in them.
And they will cry to Jehovah in straits to them, and he will deliver them from their distresses.
And he will cause them to tread in a straight way, to go to a city of dwelling.
They shall confess to Jehovah his mercy, and his wonders to the sons of man.
For he satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungering soul he filled with good.
They sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound with affliction and iron.
For they embittered the sayings of God, and they despised the counsel of the Most High:
And he will humble their heart with labor; they were weak, and none helping.
And they will cry to God in straits to them; he will save them from their distresses.
He will bring them forth from darkness and the shadow of death, and he will burst their bands.
They shall confess to Jehovah his mercy, and his wonders to the sons of man.
For he broke the brazen doors, and cut off the bars of iron.
Being turned away from the way of their transgression, they will be humbled from their iniquities.
Their soul will abhor all food, and they will draw near to the gates of death.
And they will cry to Jehovah in straits to them; he will save them from their distresses.
He will send his word and heal them, and he will deliver them from their destructions.
They shall confess to Jehovah his mercy, and his wonders to the sons of man.
And they shall sacrifice sacrifices of praise, and they shall recount his works with rejoicing.
They shall go down to the sea in ships, doing work in many waters.
They saw the works of Jehovah, and his wonders in the deep.
And he will say, and he will cause the spirit of storm to stand up, and its waves will rise up.
They will go up to the heavens, they will go down to the depths: their soul will be melted with evil.
They will reel and stagger as he intoxicated, and all their wisdom will be swallowed down.
And they will cry to Jehovah in straits to them, and he will bring them forth from their distresses.
He will set the storm for a calm, and their waves will be still.
And they will be glad that they will subside, and he will guide them to the harbor of their desire.
They shall confess to Jehovah his mercy, and his wonders to the sons of man.
And they shall exalt him in the convocation of the people, and they shall praise him in the seat of the old men.
He will set rivers to a desert, and the findings of waters to thirst;
A land of fruit to saltness, for the evil of those dwelling in it.
He will set a desert for pools of water, and a land of dryness for findings of water.
And there will he cause the hungering to dwell, and they shall prepare a city of dwelling;
And they shall sow fields and plant vineyards, and they will make fruits of produce.
And he will bless them, and they shall multiply greatly, and he will not diminish their cattle.
And they will be diminished and brought low from oppression, evil and grief.
He poured out contempt upon the nobles, and he will cause them to wander in a waste of not a way.
He will set up the needy on high from affliction, and he will set families as a flock.
The upright shall see and be glad, and all iniquity shall shut her mouth.
Who the wise and will watch these, and they shall understand the mercies of Jehovah.
Song of chanting to David. My heart being prepared, O God, I will sing and play on the harp, also mine honor.
Awake, lyre and harp: I will awake early.
I will praise thee among the people of Jehovah, and I will play on the harp in the nations.
For great above the heavens thy mercy, and even to the clouds thy truth.
Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God: and over all the earth, thy glory;
So that thy beloved ones shall be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer us.
God shake in his holy place; I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and I will measure the valley of tents.
To me Gilead; to me Manasseh; and Ephraim, the fortress of my head, and Judah my judge.
Moab the pot of my washing; upon Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistia will I shout for joy.
Who will bring me to the city of fortification? who guide me even to Edom?
Will not God? Thou didst cast us off, and wilt thou not go forth, O God, with our armies?
Give to us help from straits: and vain the salvation of man.
In God we shall do strength, and he will tread down our enemies.
To the overseer, to David a chanting. O God of my praise, thou wilt not be silent;
For the mouth of the unjust, and the mouth of deceit opened against me; they spake with me the tongue of false-hood.
And with words of hatred they surrounded me, and they will war with me gratuitously.
For my love they will oppose me: and I for prayer.
And they will set against me evil instead of good, and hatred for my love.
Appoint over him the unjust one, and the adversary shall stand at his right hand.
In his being judged he shall come forth condemned: and his prayer shall be for sin.
His days shall be few; his charge another shall take.
His sons shall be orphans, and his wife a widow.
And shaking his sons shall wander about, and they asked and sought from their desolations.
The creditor shall lay snares for all which is to him, and strangers shall plunder his labor.
There shall not be to him any drawing out mercy, and there shall not be any compassionating to his orphans.
His descendants shall be for cutting off; in the later generation their name shall be wiped off.
The iniquity of his fathers will be in remembrance to Jehovah, and the sins of his mother shall not be wiped of.
They shall be before Jehovah always, and their remembrance shall be cut off from the earth.
Because he remembered not to do mercy, and he will pursue the poor and needy man to slay the dejected of heart.
And he will love cursing, and it shall come to him: and he delighted not in praise, and it shall be far from him.
And he will put on cursing as his garment, and it shall come into his midst as water, and as oil into his bones.
It shall be to him as the garment shall cover him, and for a girdle it shall gird him always.
This the doing of those lying in wait for me from Jehovah, and speaking evil against my soul.
And thou Jehovah my Lord do with me for sake of thy name: for good thy mercy, deliver thou me.
For poor and needy am I, and my heart wounded in my midst.
As the shadow according to its declining I was gone: I was shaken off as the locust.
My knees were weak from fasting, and my flesh failed from fatness.
And I was a reproach to them: they will see me and they will shake the head.
Help me, O Jehovah my God: save me according to thy mercy:
And they shall know that this is thy hand; thou, O Jehovah, didst it.
They will curse and thou wilt bless: they arose and they shall be ashamed; and thy servant shall be glad.
They lying in wait for me shall put on shame, and they shall be covered with their shame as an upper garment.
I will praise Jehovah greatly with my mouth; and in the midst of many will I praise him.
For he will stand at the right hand of the needy to save his soul from the judges.
To David a chanting. Jehovah spake to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand and I will set thine enemies the stool to thy feet.
The rod of thy strength will Jehovah send out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
Thy people were willing in the day of thy strength, in the splendors of holiness from the womb of the dawn: to thee the dew of thy childhood.
Jehovah sware and he will not lament, Thou a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedeck.
Jehovah upon thy right hand crushed kings in the day of his anger.
He shall judge in the nations; he filled with dead bodies: he crushed the head over much land.
He shall drink from the torrent in the way: for this he shall lift up the head.
Praise ye Jah. I will praise Jehovah with all the heart, in the consultation of the upright, and the assembly.
Great the works of Jehovah, sought out to all their desires.
Strength and honor his work, and his justice stands forever.
He made remembrance to his wonders. Jehovah merciful and compassionate.
He gave prey to those fearing him: he will remember forever his covenant.
The power of his work, he announced to his people, to give them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of his hands are truth and judgment; faithful are all his charges;
Being sustained even to forever, being done in truth and uprightness.
He sent deliverance to his people: he commanded his covenant forever: holy and terrible his name.
The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah: a good understanding to all doing them: his praise stands forever.

A good man, being merciful and lending: he will hold up his words in judgment;
For he shall not be moved forever: the just one shall be for eternal remembrance.
He shall not fear an evil report: his heart being prepared to trust in Jehovah.
His heart being sustained, he will not fear even till he shall look upon his enemies.
He scattered, he gave to the needy; his justice stands forever; his horn shall be exalted in glory.
The unjust one shall see and be angry; shall gnash his teeth and he melted away: the desire of the unjust shall perish.
Praise ye Jah. Praise, ye servants of Jehovah, praise ye the name of Jehovah.
The name of Jehovah shall be praised from time and even forever.
From the rising of the sun even to its going down, the name of Jehovah is praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
Who as Jehovah our God, lifting himself up to dwell?
To see those being humbled in the heavens and in the earth?
Raising up the poor from the dust, he will lift up the needy from the dunghill.
To sit with the nobles, with the nobles of his people.
Causing the sterile woman to dwell in the house, a mother of sons being glad. Praise ye Jah.
In Israel's going forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people speaking a foreign tongue;
Judah was for his holy place, Israel his dominion.
The sea saw and it will flee: Jordan will turn away back.
The mountains leaped as rains, the hills as the sons of the flock.
What to thee, O sea, that thou wilt flee? O Jordan, thou wilt turn away back?
O mountains, ye will leap as rams? O hills, as sons of the flock?
From the face of Jehovah tremble thou earth; from the face of the God of Jacob;
He turning the rock a pool of water, the flint to fountains of waters.
Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, but to thy name thou wilt give glory, for thy mercy, for thy truth.
Wherefore shall the nations say, Where now their God?
And our God is in the heavens; did all that he delighted in.
Their images are silver and gold, the work of man's hands.
A mouth to them, and they shall not speak: eyes to them, and they will not see:
Ears to them, and they shall not hear: a nose to them, and they shall not smell:
Their hands, and they will not feel: their feet, and they shall not go: they shall not murmur in their throat.
They making them shall be as they; all that trusted in them.
O Israel, trust in Jehovah: he is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust ye in Jehovah: he their help and their shield.

Jehovah will add to you, to you and to your sons.
Ye being blessed to Jehovah, making the heavens and the earth.
The heavens of heavens to Jehovah, and he gave the earth to the sons of man.
The dead shall not praise Jah, and all going down to silence.
And we will bless Jah from time and even forever. Praise ye Jah.
I Loved, for Jehovah will hear the voice of my supplication.
For he inclined his ear to me, and in my days I will call.
The pains of death surrounded me, and the distresses of hades found me: shall find straits and affliction.
And upon the name of Jehovah will I call; now, O Jehovah, deliver my soul.

Jehovah watching the simple: I was brought low, and he will save for me.

What shall be given to thee? and what shall be added to thee, thou tongue of deceit?
Arrows of the strong one sharpened with burning coals of broom.
Wo! to me that I sojourned in Mesech; I dwelt with the tents of Kedar.
My soul dwelt much upon it with Him hating peace.
I peace: and when I shall speak, they for war.
Song of ascensions. I will lift up mine eyes to the mountains from whence shall come my help.
My help from Jehovah; he made the heavens and the earth.
He will not give to move thy foot: he watching thee will not slumber.
Behold, he watching. Israel will not slumber and he will not sleep.
Jehovah watching thee Jehovah thy shade upon thy right hand.
By day the sun shall not burn thee, and the moon in the night.
Jehovah shall watch thee from all evil: he shall watch thy soul.
Jehovah shall watch thy going out and thy coming in, from time and even forever.
Song of ascensions to David. I was glad in their saying to me, We will go to the house of Jehovah.
Our feet were standing in the gates of <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as:</i></font><b> Jeursalem </b><Rf>Jerusalem.
Jerusalem was built as a city, joined to it together.
There the tribes went up, the tribes of Jah, the testimonies to Israel, to confess to the name of Jehovah.
For there sat thrones for judgment to the house of David.
Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem: they loving thee shall be at rest.
Peace shall be in thy fortification, peace in thy palaces.
For sake of my brethren and my friends, I will now speak, Peace upon.
For sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek out good for thee.
Song of ascensions. To thee dwelling in the heavens I lifted up mine eyes.
Behold, as the eyes of servants to the hand of their lords, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are to Jehovah our God, even till he compassionate us.
Compassionate us, O Jehovah, compassionate us: for we were much filled with contempt.
Much was our soul filled with it, a derision of those living at ease the contempt of the proud.
Song of ascensions to David. Unless Jehovah was to us, now shall Israel say,
Unless Jehovah was to us in the rising up of man against us,
Then they swallowed us down living, in the kindling of their anger against us:
Then the waters overflowed us, the torrent passed over our soul:
Then the swelling waters passed over our soul.
Blessed be Jehovah, who gave us not a prey to their teeth.
Our soul as a sparrow was delivered from the snare of the fowlers: the snare was broken and we were delivered.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah; he made the heavens and the earth.
Song of ascensions. They trusting in Jehovah are as mount Zion; it shall not be moved; remaining forever.
Jerusalem, the mountains are round about to her; and Jehovah is round about to his people from now and even to forever.
For the rod of the unjust one shall not rest upon the lot of the just; so that the just shall not stretch forth their hand in iniquity.
Do good, O Jehovah, to the good and to the upright in their hearts.
And those turning to their winding ways, Jehovah will cause them to go with those working iniquity: peace upon Israel.
Song of ascensions. In Jehovah turning back the returning of we were as those dreaming.
Then our mouth will be filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing: then shall they say among the nations, Jehovah magnified to do with those.
Jehovah magnified to do with us; we were made glad.
Jehovah turned back our captivity, as torrents in the south.
They sowing in tears shall reap in rejoicing.
He going, shall go; and weeping he lifted up the drawing of the seed: coming, he shall come with joy, lifting up his sheaves.
Song of ascensions to Solomon. If Jehovah shall not build the house, they building it, in it labored in vain. If Jehovah shall not watch the city, he watching, watched in vain.
In vain for you rising early to arise from after sitting; eating the bread of toils: so will he give to his beloved sleep.
Behold, sons are the inheritance of Jehovah: the reward of the fruit of the womb.
As arrows in the hand of the strong one, so are sons of youth.
Happy the man who filled his quiver from them: they shall not be ashamed when they shall speak with their enemies in the gate.
Song of ascensions Happy every one fearing Jehovah; going in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands: happy thou, and well to thee.
Thy wife as a vine bearing fruit in the sides of thy house: thy sons as plants of olives round about thy table.
Behold, that thus shall the man be praised fearing Jehovah.
Jehovah shall bless thee from Zion: and look thou upon the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
And see thou the sons to thy sons: peace upon Israel.
Song of ascensions. Much they pressed me from my youth, shall Israel now say:
Much they pressed me from my youth: also they shall not prevail against me.
They ploughing, ploughed upon my back: they made long to their furrows.
Jehovah the just cut the entanglings of the unjust.
They shall be ashamed and draw back all hating Zion.
They shall be as the grass of the roofs drying up before it was drawn out:
He harvesting filled not his hand; and he heaping together, not his arm.
And they passing by, said not, The praise of Jehovah to you: we praised you in the name of Jehovah.
Song of ascensions. From the depths I called thee, O Jehovah.
O Jehovah, hear to my voice: thine ears shall be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If thou, Jehovah, shalt watch iniquities, O Jehovah, who shall stand?
For with thee, forgiveness; so that thou shalt be feared.
I waited for Jehovah, my soul waited, and I hoped for his word.
My soul for Jehovah more than they watching for the morning: they watching for the morning.
Israel hoped for Jehovah: for with Jehovah is mercy and great deliverance.
And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
Song of ascensions to David. O Jehovah, my heart was not lifted up, and mine eyes were not exalted, and I went not in great things and in wonders above me.
If I did not place and rest my soul as a child weaned of his Mother: my soul as a weaned child.
Israel shall hope for Jehovah from now and even to forever.
Song of ascensions. Remember, O Jehovah, for David with all his affliction.
Who sware to Jehovah; he vowed to the mighty one of Jacob:
If I shall go into the tent of my house, if I shall go up upon the bed of my couch;
If I shall give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eye-lashes,
Even till I shall find a place for Jehovah, dwellings for the mighty one of Jacob.
Behold, we heard it in Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the forest.
We will come in to his dwellings: we will worship at the footstool of his feet.
Arise, O Jehovah, to thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
Thy priests shall put on justice, and thy godly ones shall rejoice.
For sake of David thy servant thou wilt not turn away the face of thy Messiah.
Jehovah sware the truth to David; he will not turn back from it: from the fruit of thy belly I will set upon the throne to thee.
If thy sons shall watch my covenant and my testimonies, these I shall teach them; also their sons even to forever shall sit upon the throne to thee forever.
For Jehovah chose in Zion; for he desired it for a dwelling to himself.
This my rest even forever: here I will dwell, for I desired it.
Blessing I will bless her provision: I will fill her needy with bread.
And I will put upon her priests salvation, and her godly ones shall rejoice a rejoicing.
There will I cause the horn to David to spring up: I prepared a lamp for my Messiah.
I will put shame upon his enemies, and upon him shall his diadem flourish.
Song of ascensions to David. Behold, how good and how pleasant the dwelling of brethren even together.
As good oil upon the head, going down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron: coming down upon the mouth of his garments:
As the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion: for there Jehovah commanded the blessing, life even forever.
Song of ascensions. Behold, praise ye Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, standing in the house of Jehovah, in the nights.
Lift up your hand to the holy place, and praise ye Jehovah.
Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion: he made the heavens and the earth.
Praise ye Jah. Praise ye the name of Jehovah; praise, ye servants of Jehovah,
Standing in the house of Jehovah, in the enclosures of the house of our God.
Praise ye Jah; for Jehovah is good: play on the harp to his name, for it is pleasant.
For Jah chose to himself Jacob; Israel for his property.
For I knew that great is Jehovah, and our Lord above all gods.
All which Jehovah delighted in he did, in the heavens and in the earth, in the seas and all the depths.
Causing the liftings up to ascend from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain; bringing forth the wind from his treasures.
He struck the first-born of Egypt, from man even to cattle.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
He struck many nations, and slew strong kings;
To Sihon, king of the Amorites, and to Og, king of Bashan, and to all the kings of Canaan:
And he gave their land an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.
O Jehovah, thy name is forever; O Jehovah, thy remembrance to generation and generation.
For Jehovah will judge his people, and he will compassion upon his servants.
The images of the nation are silver and gold, the work of man's hands.
A mouth to them, and they shall not speak; eyes to them, and they shall not see;
Ears to them, and they shall not hear; also there is no spirit in their mouth.
They making them shall be as they: every one who trusted in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah: O house of Aaron, praise ye Jehovah:
O house of Levi, praise ye Jehovah: ye fearing Jehovah, praise Jehovah.
Blessed be Jehovah from Zion, dwelling in Jerusalem. Praise ye Jah.
Confess ye to Jehovah, for he is good: for his mercy is forever.
Confess to the God of gods: for his mercy is forever.
Confess to the Lord of lords: for his mercy is forever.
To him alone making great wonders: for his mercy is forever.
To him making the heavens in understanding: for his mercy is forever.
To him spreading the earth upon the sea: for his mercy is forever.
To him making great lights: for his mercy is forever.
The sun for the rulings in the day: for his mercy is forever.
The moon and the stars for rulings in the night: for his mercy is forever.
To him striking Egypt in their first-born: for his mercy is forever.
And he will bring forth Israel from the midst of them: for his mercy is forever.
With a hand of strength, and with an arm stretched out: for his mercy is forever.
To him dividing the sea of sedge into parts: for his mercy is forever.
And he caused Israel to pass through in its midst: for his mercy is forever.
And he shook off Pharaoh and his strength into the sea of sedge: for his mercy is forever.
To him causing his people to go into the desert: for his mercy is forever.
To him striking great kings: for his mercy is forever.
And he will slay mighty kings: for his mercy is forever.
To Sihon, king of the Amorites: for his mercy is forever.
To Og, king of Bashan: for his mercy is forever.
And he gave their land for an inheritance: for his mercy is forever,
An inheritance to Israel his servant: for his mercy is forever.
He remembered for us our lowness: for his mercy is forever:
And he will redeem us from our enemies: for his mercy is forever.
He gave bread to all flesh: for his mercy is forever.
Confess ye to the God of the heavens: for his mercy is forever.
By the rivers of Babel, there we sat down: also we wept in our remembering Zion.
Upon the willows in her midst, we hung our harps;
For there they carrying us away captive asked us the words of a song; and they heaping us up gladness; Sing to us from the song of Zion.
How shall we sing the song of Jehovah upon the land of a stranger?
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right hand shall be forgotten.
My tongue shall cleave to in palate, if I remember thee not; if I bring not up Jerusalem upon the head of my joy.
Remember, O Jehovah, for the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem; they saying, Make bare, make bare, even to the foundations in her.
O daughter of Babel laying waste; happy he recompensing to thee thy retribution thou didst to us.
Happy he taking hold and dashing in pieces thy children against the rock.
To David. I will praise thee with all my heart: before God I will play to thee on the harp.
I will worship to thy holy temple, and I will praise thy name for thy mercy and for thy truth: for thou didst magnify thy word over all thy name.
In the day I called, and thou wilt answer me; thou wilt enlarge me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Jehovah, for they heard the sayings of thy mouth.
And they shall sing in the ways of Jehovah: for great the glory of Jehovah.
If Jehovah is high, and he will see the humble one: and the lofty one he will know from far off.
If I shall go in the midst of straits, thou wilt make me alive: against the anger of mine enemies thou wilt stretch forth thy hand, and thy right hand shall save me.
Jehovah will complete for me: O Jehovah, thy mercy is forever: thou wilt not let go the works of thy hands.
To the overseer, to David a chanting. O Jehovah thou didst search me, and thou wilt know.
Thou knewest my sitting and my rising; thou didst understand for my thoughts from far of.
Thou didst sift my way and my lying down, and thou knewest all my ways.
For not a word in my tongue, behold, O Jehovah, thou knewest all of it.
Thou didst press me behind and before, and thou wilt place thine hand upon me.
Knowledge being wonderful from me; being high, I shall not be able for it.
Whither shall I go from thy spirit? and whither from thy face shall I flee?
If I shall ascend to the heavens, thou art there: and shall I bend down to hades, behold thee.
Shall I lift up the wings of the dawn? shall I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea?
Also there thy hand will guide me, and thy right hand will hold me.
And saying, surely the darkness shall fall upon me; and the night shone about me.
Also darkness shall not darken from thee; and the night shall shine as the day: as the darkness, so the light.
For thou didst possess my reins: thou wilt cover me in my mother's womb.
I will praise thee; for I was wonderfully distinguished: thy works are wonders, and my soul knew greatly.
My bones were not hid from thee, when I was made in secret. I was variegated in the lower parts of the earth.
Thine eyes saw my substance unformed; and upon thy book all of them shall be written; the days they were formed, and not one in them.
And to me how were thy thoughts precious, O God! how were their heads strong!
I will count them; they shall be multiplied above the sand of the sea: I awoke, and I am yet with thee.
Surely thou wilt kill the unjust one, O God: and ye men of bloods, depart from me.
For they will say to thee for mischief; thine enemies were lifted up for vanity.
Shall I not hate those hating thee, O Jehovah? and I shall loathe against those rising up against thee.
I hated them with completeness of hatred: they were to me for enemies.
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me and know my thoughts:
And see if the way of pain is in me, and guide me in the eternal way.
To the overseer, chanting to David: Deliver me, O Jehovah, from the evil man: wilt thou guard me from the man of violences.
Who reckoned evils in the heart; all the day they will gather together wars.
They sharpened their tongue as a serpent; the poison of asps under their lips. Silence,
Watch me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the unjust one; from the man of violences wilt thou guard me; who purposed to overthrow my steps.
The proud hid a snare for me, and cords; they spread a net at the hand of the way; they set snares for me. Silence.
I said to Jehovah, Thou my God: give ear, O Jehovah, to the voice of my supplication.
O Jehovah my Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou didst cover for my head in the day of weapons.
Thou wilt not give, O Jehovah, the desires of the unjust one: thou wilt not bring forth his device; they will be lifted up. Silence.
The head of those surrounding me, the labor of their lips shall cover them.
Burning coals shall be shaken upon them; he shall cast them into fire, into whirlpools; they shall not rise up.
A man of tongue shall not be prepared in the earth: a man of violence, evil shall hunt him to melt down the coverings.
Knowing that Jehovah will do judgment to the poor one, judgment to the needy.
But the just shall confess to thy name: the upright shall dwell with thy face.
Chanting to David. O Jehovah, I called to thee; hasten to me; give ear to my voice in my calling to thee.
My prayer shall be prepared incense before thee; the lifting up my hands the gift of the evening.
Set, O Jehovah, a watch to my mouth; guard over the door of my lips.
Thou wilt not incline my heart to an evil word, to work works in injustice with men doing iniquity: and I will not eat upon their dainties.
The just one shall smite me; a mercy: and he shall admonish me, an oil of the head it shall not decorate my head: for yet my prayer in their evils.
Their judges were cast down against the hands of the rock, and they heard my words, for they were sweet.
As he cutting up and cleaving asunder in the earth, our bones were scattered at the mouth of hades.
For to thee, O Jehovah my Lord, are mine eyes: in thee I put my trust; thou wilt not make my soul naked.
Watch me from the hands of the snare they will lay for me, and the snares of those working iniquity.
The unjust shall fall into their nets together, till I shall pass by.
Of the understanding to David; a prayer in his being in the cave. With my voice I will cry to Jehovah; with my voice I will entreat to Jehovah.
I will pour out before him my complaint; I will announce my straits before him.
In my spirit languishing upon me, and thou knewest my beaten paths. In the way which I shall go they hid a snare for me.
Looking upon the right hand, and seeing, and none caring for me: flight perished from me; none sought for my soul.
I cried to thee, O Jehovah: I said, Thou my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
Attend to my cry, for I languished greatly: deliver me from those pursuing me, for they were strengthened above me.
Bring forth my soul out of prison to praise thy name: the just shall surround upon me; for thou wilt benefit to me.
Chanting to David. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, give ear to my supplication: in thy faithfulness answer me; in thy justice.
And thou wilt not come into judgment with thy servant, for all living shall not be justified before thee.
For the enemy pursued my soul; he crushed to the earth my life; he caused me to dwell in darknesses, as the dead of old.
And my spirit will languish upon me, and my heart will be desolate within me.
I remembered the days of old and I meditated in all thy work, and I will meditate upon the work of thy hands.
I spread out my hands to thee: my soul as a weary land for thee. Silence.
Quickly answer me, O Jehovah: my spirit failed: thou wilt not hide thy face from me: I was made like those going down to the pit.
Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee I trusted: cause me to know the way that I shall go; for to thee I lifted up my soul.
Deliver me from mine enemies, O Jehovah: to thee I covered myself.
Teach me to do thine acceptance, for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; thou wilt guide me into a land of uprightness.
For sake of thy name, O Jehovah, thou wilt make me live: in thy justice thou wilt bring forth my soul out of straits.
And in thy mercy thou wilt cut off mine enemies, and thou destroyedst all those pressing my soul: for I am thy servant.
To David. Blessed be Jehovah my rock, teaching my hands for the encounter, my fingers for war;
My mercy and my fortress, my height and delivering for me; my shield, and in him I put my trust; treading down peoples under me.
O Jehovah, what is man and thou wilt know him? the son of man, and thou wilt reckon him?
Man was likened to vanity: his days as a shadow passing away.
O Jehovah, incline thy heavens, and thou wilt come down: touch upon the mountains and they shall smoke.
Send forth the lightning, and thou wilt scatter them: send thine arrows, and thou wilt destroy them.
Send thy hands from height; snatch me away, and deliver me from many waters, from the hand of the sons of the stranger;
Whom their mouth spake vanity, and their right hand a right hand of falsehood.
O God, a new song will I sing to thee; with an instrument of ten strings, I will play on the harp to thee.
Giving salvation to kings: snatch in away David his servant from the evil sword.
Snatch me away and deliver me from the hand of the sons of the stranger, whom their mouth spake vanity, and their right hand a right hand of falsehood:
That our sons as plants growing great in their youth, our daughters as corners variegated, the likeness of a temple:
Our garners being filled, bringing forth from sort to sort; our sheep bringing forth thousands, ten thousands in our streets:
Our oxen bearing no breaking, and no coming forth, and no complaining in our broad places.
Happy the people thus and thus to him: happy the people Jehovah his God.
Praise to David. I will exalt thee my God, the King, and I will praise thy name forever and ever.
In all the day I will praise thee, and I will praise thy name forever and ever.
Great is Jehovah, and being greatly praised; and to his greatness no search.
Generation to generation shall praise thy works, and they shall announce thy powers.
I will speak the splendor of the honor of thy majesty, and the words of thy wonders.
And they shall tell the strength of thy terrible things, and I will recount thy greatnesses.
They shall pour forth the remembrance of the multitude of thy goodness, and they shall shout forth thy justice.
Jehovah is compassionate and merciful; slow to anger, and great of mercy.
Jehovah is good to all, and his mercies over all his works.
All thy works shall praise thee, O Jehovah, and thy godly ones shall praise thee.
They shall tell the glory of thy kingdom, and they shall speak of thy strength;
To make known to the sons of man his powers, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom.
Thy kingdom a kingdom of all times, and thy dominion in every generation and generation.
Jehovah upholds to all falling, and raises up for all bowed down.
The eyes of all hope for thee, and thou givest to them their food in its time.
Opening thy hand and filling the desire to all living.
Jehovah is just in all his ways, and merciful in all his works.
Jehovah is near to all calling upon him, to all who shall call upon him in truth.
He will do the desire of them fearing him, and he will hear their cry and he will save them.
Jehovah watches all loving him, and all the unjust he will destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah, and all flesh shall bless his holy name forever and ever.
Praise ye Jah. Praise Jehovah, O my soul.
I will praise Jehovah in my life; I will play on the harp to my God in my continuing.
Ye shall not trust in nobles: in the son of man, to him no salvation.
His spirit shall go forth, he shall turn back to his earth; in that day his thoughts perished.
Happy is he the God of Jacob for his help, his hope upon Jehovah his God:
He made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them: he watched the truth forever.
He did judgment for the oppressed; he gave bread to the hungering: Jehovah loosed those being bound.
Jehovah opened the eyes of the blind: Jehovah raised those being bowed down: Jehovah loved the just.
Jehovah watched the strangers he will restore the orphan and the widow, and he will overturn the way of the unjust.
Jehovah shall reign forever, thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation. Praise ye Jah.
Praise ye Jah: for it is good to play on the harp to our God; for it is pleasant: praise is becoming.
Jehovah builds Jerusalem: he will collect together the outcasts of Israel.
Healing to the broken of heart, and binding up their pains.
Counting the number to the stars, he will call names to all of them.
Great our Lord, and great of power: to his understanding no number.
Jehovah setting up again the poor, and humbling the unjust even to the earth.
Strike up to Jehovah with praise; play upon the harp to our God:
Covering the heavens with clouds, preparing rain for the earth, causing the grass to spring up on the mountains.
Giving to the cattle its food, to the sons of the ravens which call.
He will not delight in the strength of the horse: he will not be pleased in the legs of a man.
Jehovah being delighted in those fearing him, in those hoping for his mercy.
Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
For he strengthened the bars of thy gates; he blessed thy sons within thee.
Setting thy bound peace, he will fill thee with the fat of the wheat.
Sending his word upon the earth, even till his word shall run quickly.
Giving snow as wool: he will scatter the hoarfrost as ashes.
Casting his ice as morsels: before his cold who shall stand?
He will send his word and melt them: his wind shall blow, the waters will flow.
Announcing his word to Jacob, his laws and judgments to Israel.
He did not thus to every nation: and judgments they knew them not Praise ye Jah.
Praise ye Jah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
Praise ye him all his messengers: praise ye him all his armies.
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise ye him all the stars of light.
Praise ye him, the heavens of heavens, and the waters above the heavens.
They shall praise the name of Jehovah, for he commanded and they were created:
And he will cause them to stand even to forever: he gave a law and it shall not pass away.
Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye dragons and all depths:
Fire and hail, snow and vapor: the spirit of storm doing his word:
Mountains and all hills; the tree of fruit and all cedars:
The beast and all cattle; the creeping thing, and the bird of wing:
Kings of the earth, and all peoples; chiefs and all judges of the earth:
Young men and also virgins; old men with the youths:
They shall praise the name of Jehovah: for his name alone is exalted; his majesty over the earth and the heavens.
And he will lift up the horn to his people, praise to all his godly ones; to the sons of Israel a people drawing near to him. Praise ye Jah.
Praise ye Jah. Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise in the convocation of his godly ones.
Israel shall rejoice in him making him: the sons of Zion shall exult in their king.
They shall praise his name in the dance, and they shall play to him upon the drum and harp.
For Jehovah delighted in his people: he will adorn the humble in salvation.
The godly ones shall triumph in glory; they shall rejoice upon their bed.
The liftings up of God in their throat, and a sword of two mouths in their hand;
To do vengeance upon the nations, chastisements upon the peoples.
To bind their kings in fetters, and their honorable ones in fetters of iron;
To do upon them the judgment written: this honor to all his godly ones. Praise ye Jah.
Praise ye Jah. Praise ye God in his holy place: praise him in the firmament of his power.
Praise ye him in his powers: praise him according to the multitude of his greatness.
Praise ye him with the clangor of the trumpet: praise him with the lyre and the harp.
Praise him with the drum and the dance: praise ye him with strings and the pipe.
Praise ye him with ringing instruments of hearing: praise him with ringing instruments of loud noise.
All breath shall praise Jah. Praise ye Jah.
Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel;
To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice and judgment, and uprightness;
To give craftiness to the simple, and to the youth, knowledge and meditation.
The wise one will hear and he will add learning: and he understanding, shall obtain guidance:
To understand a proverb, and an enigma: the words of the wise and their parables.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: the foolish despised wisdom and instruction.
My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and thou shalt not reject the law of thy mother:
For they a garland of grace to thy head, and necklaces for thy throat.
My son, if they sinning shall entice thee, thou shalt not go in.
If they shall say, Go with us, we will lie in wait for blood, we will hide for the innocent gratuitously;
We will swallow them down living, as hades, and whole, as they going down to the pit:
We shall find precious riches, we will fill our houses with spoil:
Wilt thou cast thy lot in the midst of us; one purse shall be to all:
My son, thou shalt not go in the way with them; withhold thy foot from their beaten paths:
For their feet will run to evil, and they will hasten to pour out blood:
For gratuitously the net was spread in the eyes of all possessing a wing.
And they will lie in wait for their blood; they will hide for their souls.
So the ways of every one plundering plunder; he will take the soul of those possessing it.
Wisdom will cry without; in the broad places she will give her voice:
She will call in the head of sound, in the entrances of the gates: in the city she will say her words:
How long, ye simple, will ye love simplicity? and mockers delight to mock for them, and the foolish hate knowledge?
Ye shall turn back at my reproofs: behold, I will pour forth my spirit to you, I will make known my words to you.
Because I called and ye will refuse; I stretched forth my hands, and none attending;
And ye will reject all my counsels, and ye desired not my reproofs:
Also I will laugh at your ruin: I will deride in the coming of your terror;
In your terror coming as a destroying tempest, and your ruin shall come as a whirlwind; in the coming upon you of straits and distress.
Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me, and shall not find me;
For that they hated knowledge, and chose not the fear of Jehovah:
They desired not for my counsels: and derided all my reproofs.
And they shall eat from the fruit of their way, and be filled with their purposes.
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the error of the foolish shall destroy them.
And he hearing to me shall dwell in confidence, and being quiet from fear of evil.
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commands with thee;
To attend to wisdom thou wilt incline thine ear, thy heart to understanding;
For if thou will call to understanding, wilt give thy voice to understanding.
If thou wilt seek her as silver, and dig for her as hidden treasure;
Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and thou shalt find the knowledge of God.
For Jehovah will give wisdom: from his mouth knowledge and understanding.
He treasured up deliverance for the upright: a shield to those going in uprightness:
To guard the paths of judgment, and he will watch the way of his godly ones.
Then thou shalt understand justice and judgment and uprightness; every good track.
For wisdom shall come into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul.
Meditation shall watch over thee, understanding shall guard thee:
To deliver thee from the evil way, from the man speaking deceit;
Those forsaking the paths of straightness to go in the ways of darkness;
Those rejoicing to do evil will exult in the deceit of evil;
Whose paths are perverted, and in their tracks are bent aside:
To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings;
Forsaking the friend of her youth, and forgetting the covenant of her God.
For her house sunk down to death, and her tracks to the shades.
All going in it shall not turn back, and they shall not overtake the paths of life.
So that thou shalt go in the way of the good, and thou shalt watch the paths of the just.
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the blameless shall remain in it.
And the unjust shall be cut off from the land, and they transgressing shall be wiped off from it.
My son, thou shalt not forget my law, and thy heart shall guard my commands:
For length of days and years of life, and peace they shall add to thee.
Mercy and truth shall not forsake thee: bind them upon thy throat; write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
And find grace and good understanding in the eyes of God and man.
Trust to Jehovah with all thy heart; and thou shalt not lean to thine understanding.
In all thy ways know him, and he will make straight thy paths.
Thou shalt not be wise in thine eyes: fear Jehovah and depart from evil.
It shall be healing to thy sinews, and moistening to thy bones.
Honor Jehovah from thy substance, and from the first-fruits of all thy produce.
And thy storehouses shall be filled with abundance, and thy wine-vats shall break forth with new wine.
My son, thou shalt not reject the instruction of Jehovah, and thou shalt not loathe upon his reproofs:
For whom Jehovah shall love he will rebuke, as a father the son he will delight in.
Happy the man finding wisdom; and the man shall bring forth understanding.
For good her gain above the gain of silver, and her increase above gold.
She is precious above red corals: and all thy delights shall not be equal with her.
Length of days in her right hand; in her left, riches and honor.
Her ways the ways of pleasantness, and all her beaten paths, peace.
She is a tree of life to all holding upon her: and happy he holding her fast.
Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; he prepared the heavens by understanding.
By his knowledge the depths were rent, and the clouds will drop dew.
My son, they shall not depart from thine eyes: keep counsel and meditation:
And they shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy throat.
Then shalt thou go thy way confidently, and thy foot shall not stumble.
If thou shalt lie down thou shalt not be afraid: and thou liest down and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Thou shalt not be afraid from sudden terror, and from the destruction of the unjust when it shall come.
For Jehovah shall be in thy confidence, and he watched thy foot from being taken.
Thou shalt not withhold good from those possessing it in its being to the power of thy hand to do.
Thou shalt not say to thy neighbor, Go, and turn back, and to-morrow I will give; and there is with thee.
Thou shalt not fabricate evil upon thy neighbor, and he dwelling confidently with thee.
Thou shalt not contend with man to no purpose, if he did thee no evil.
Thou shalt not envy against a man of violence, and thou shalt choose in all his ways.
For the perverse is an abomination of Jehovah: and his intercourse with the upright.
The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the unjust one: and he will bless the dwelling of the just.
But he will deride to those deriding: and he will give grace to the humble.
The wise shall inherit glory, and the foolish exalt dishonor.
Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
For I gave to you good instruction; ye shall not forsake my law.
For I was son to my father; tender and only before the face of my mother.
And he taught me, and he will say to me, Thy heart shall hold fast my words: watch my commands and live.
Obtain wisdom, obtain understanding: thou shalt not forget, and thou shalt not decline from the words of my mouth.
Thou shalt not forsake her, and she will watch thee: love her, and she will guard thee.
Wisdom the beginning; obtain wisdom, and with all thine acquisition, obtain understanding.
Lift her up and she shall exalt thee: she will honor thee when thou shalt embrace her.
She will give to thy head a garland of grace: a crown of glory she will deliver thee.
Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of life shall be multiplied to thee.
In the way of wisdom I taught thee; I caused thee to tread in the tracks of uprightness.
In thy going, thy steps shall not be pressed; and if thou shalt run thou shalt not be weak.
Lay hold upon instruction, thou shalt not let go: guard her for she is thy life.
In the path of the unjust thou shalt not go, and thou shalt not advance in the way of the wicked.
Reject it, thou shalt not pass in it; turn aside from it and pass by.
For they slept not, if they shall not do evil; and their sleep was taken away, if they shall not cause to falter.
For they ate the bread of injustice, and they will drink the wine of violences:
The path of the just as the light shining, going and shining even to the day prepared.
The way of the unjust as darkness: they shall not know in what they shall stumble.
My son, attend to my word; incline thine ear to my sayings.
They shall not turn aside from thine eyes; watch them in the midst of thy heart.
For they are life to those finding them, and healing to all their flesh.
Guard thy heart with all watching, for from it the goings forth of life.
Turn away from thee perverseness of mouth, and frowardness of lips remove far oft from thee.
Thine eyes shall look straight before, and thine eyelashes shall be right before thee.
Make level the track of thy feet, and all thy ways shall be prepared.
Thou shalt not decline to the right and the left: turn away thy foot from evil.
My son, attend to my wisdom; incline thine ear to understanding:
To watch meditation, and thy lips shall guard knowledge.
For the lips of the strange woman will drop droppings of the honeycomb, and her palate is smooth above oil:
And her latter state being bitter as wormwood; sharp as a two-mouthed sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps will hold fast to hades.
Lest thou shalt make level the path of life, her tracks wavered; thou wilt not know.
And now, ye sons, hear to me, and ye shall not depart from the words of my mouth.
Remove far off from her thy way, and thou shalt not draw near to the door of her house:
Lest thou shalt give thy strength to others, and thy years to the cruel:
Lest strangers shall be filled with thy strength, and thy labors in the house of strangers;
And thou didst lament in thy latter state, in the consuming of thy flesh and thy fulness,
And thou saidst, How did I hate instruction, and my heart despise reproofs.
And I heard not to the voice of him teaching me, and I inclined not mine ear to him instructing me.
As I was almost in all evil in the midst of the convocation and the assembly.
Drink water from thy pit, and flowing from the midst of thy well.
Thy fountains shall be dispersed without; in the broad places streams of waters.
They shall be to thee alone, and not strangers with thee.
Thy fountain shall be blessed: and rejoice from the wife of thy youth.
The hind of loves and the wild goat of grace; her breasts shall satiate thee in all time; thou shalt always wander in her loves.
And wherefore, my son, wilt thou wander with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
For before the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of man, and he makes level all his tracks.
His iniquities shall take the unjust one, and with the cords of his sins shall he be held fast.
He shall die in not being instructed, and he shall wander in the multitude of his folly.
My son, if thou becamest surety for thy friend, thou didst strike thy hands for a stranger;
Thou wert snared with the sayings of thy mouth, thou wert taken with the sayings of thy mouth.
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself when thou camest into the hand of thy friend; go humble thyself and enlarge thy friend.
Thou shalt not give sleep to thine eyes, and slumber to thine eyelashes.
Deliver thyself as the roe from the hand, and as the bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, thou slothful one; see her ways, and be wise:
Which no leader to her, scribe and ruler;
She will prepare in summer her bread, gathering her food in harvest.
How long, O slothful one, wilt thou lie down? when wilt thou rise from thy sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down:
And thy poverty came as he going, and thy want as a man of the shield.
A man of Belial, a man of iniquity, goes with perverseness of mouth.
Pinching the eyes, speaking with the feet, teaching with his fingers;
Perverseness in his heart, fabricating evil in all time, he will send forth strifes.
For this, his destruction shall come suddenly; in a moment he shall be broken, and none healing.
These six Jehovah hated, and seven an abomination of his soul:
Eyes being lifted up; a tongue of falsehood, and hands shedding innocent blood,
A heart fabricating purposes of iniquity; feet being quick to run to evil,
A witness of falsehood, breathing out lies, and sending strife between brethren.
My son, watch the commands of thy father, and thou shalt not reject the laws of thy mother:
Tie them always upon thy heart; bind them upon thy throat.
In thy going about it shall lead thee; in thy lying down it shall watch over thee; and awaking, it shall speak to thee.
For the command is a lamp, and the law a light; and the way of life the reproof of instruction:
To watch thee from the woman of evil, from the smoothness of the strange tongue.
Thou shalt not desire her beauty in thy heart, and she shall not take thee with her eyelashes.
For by a woman a harlot, even to a round of bread: and a man's wife will hunt the precious soul.
A man taking fire in his bosom, shall his garments not be burnt?
If a man shall go upon burning coals shall his feet not be burnt?
So he going in to his neighbor's wife; all touching upon her shall not be innocent.
They will not despise a thief if he shall steal to fill up his soul; for he will be hungry.
And being found he shall recompense seven fold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
He committing adultery with a woman lacked a heart: destroying his soul he will do it.
A blow and contempt shall he find; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the wrath of man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not lift up the face of any ransom, and he will not be willing if thou shalt increase the reward.
My son, watch my words, and thou shalt hide my commands with thee.
Watch my commands, and live; and my law as the pupil of thine eyes.
Bind them upon thy fingers, and write them upon the tablet of thine heart.
Say to wisdom, Thou my sister; and thou shalt call knowledge to understanding:
To watch thyself from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings.
For in the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,
And I shall see among the simple, I shall perceive among the sons a youth wanting heart,
Passing in the street near her corner; and he will step the way of her house,
In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night, in the thick darkness:
And behold, a woman to his meeting, the attire of a harlot, and hidden of heart.
She being noisy and perverse; her feet will not dwell in her house:
One time without, one time in the broad ways; and she will lie in wait near every corner.
She laid hold upon him and kissed to him; she strengthened her face, and she will say to him,
Sacrifices of peace upon me: today I repaid my vows.
For this, I shall come forth to thy meeting, to seek thy face, and I shall find thee.
With adornings I spread my bed, variegated with thread of Egypt.
I sprinkled my bed with myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.
Come, we will be satisfied with loves till the morning: we will rejoice ourselves with loves.
For the man not in the house, he went in a way far off.
He took a bundle of silver in his hand; he will come to his house the day of the full moon.
With much of her talking she caused him to turn aside; with the smoothness of her lips she will thrust him away.
He went after her suddenly as the ox will go to the slaughter, and as the fetter for the correction of the foolish.
Till an arrow shall cleave his liver; as a bird hastening to the snare, and not knowing that it is for his soul.
And now, ye sons, hear to me, and attend to the sayings of my mouth.
And thy heart shall not deviate to her ways; thou shalt not wander in her beaten paths.
For she cast down many wounded, and the strong all being slain by her.
Her house the ways to hades, going down to the chambers of death.
Shall not wisdom call, and understanding give her voice?
She stood upon the head of the heights, upon the way of the house of the beaten paths.
At the hand of the gates, at the mouth of the city from the coming in of the doors she will cry:
To you, ye men, I shall call, and my voice is to the sons of man.
Understand craftiness, ye simple: and ye foolish, understand the heart.
Hear ye, for I will speak dear things; and the openings of my lips uprightnesses.
For my palate shall meditate the truth, and evil is the abomination of my lips.
In justice are all the sayings of my mouth; nothing in them crooked and perverse.
All of them straight to him understanding, and right to those finding knowledge.
Receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge above tried gold.
For wisdom is good above pearls, and all delights shall not be made equal with her.
I wisdom dwelt with prudence, and I shall find the knowledge of machinations.
The fear of Jehovah hates evil: pride and haughtiness, and the evil way, and the mouth of perverseness I hated.
To me counsel and wisdom: I am understanding; to me is strength.
By me kings shall reign, and princes shall decree justice.
By me chiefs shall have dominion, and nobles all judging the earth.
I loved those loving me: and they seeking me shall find me.
Riches and honor are with me; splendid riches and justice.
My fruit is good above gold, and above pure gold; and my gain above tried silver.
I shall go in the way of justice, in the midst of the beaten paths of judgment:
To cause those loving me to inherit existence: and I will fill their treasures.
Jehovah set me up the beginning of his way, before his works from ancient time.
From forever I was knit together, from the beginning, from the first of the earth.
In no depths was I begun; in no fountains abundant in waters.
Before the mountains were settled; before the hills I had a beginning:
Yet he made not the earth and the fields, and the head of the clods of the habitable globe.
In his preparing the heavens I was there: in his inscribing a circle upon the face of the deep:
In his making firm the clouds from above: in his strengthening the fountains of the deep:
In his setting his law to the sea, and the waters shall not pass by his mouth; in his making firm the foundations of the earth:
And I shall be near him the builder, and I shall be a delight of day, day, smiling before him in all time.
Smiling in the habitable globe of his earth; and my delight with the sons of man.
And now ye sons, hear to me: and the happy shall watch my ways.
Hear ye instructions, and be wise, and ye shall not reject it.
Happy the man hearing to me, to watch at my doors day, day; to watch the door posts of my entrances.
For he finding me, the finding of life, and he shall bring forth acceptance from Jehovah.
And he sinning against me did violence to his soul: all hating me loved death.
Wisdom built her house, she hewed out her seven pillars:
She slaughtered her slaughter; she mingled her wine; also she prepared her table.
She sent forth her girls: she will call upon the wings of the heights of the city,
Who the simple, he shall turn aside here: he wanting heart, she said to him,
Come ye, eat of my bread, and drink ye of the wine I mingled.
Forsake ye the foolish, and live; and go straight in the way of understanding.
He instructing him mocking received to himself dishonor: and he reproving to the unjust one, his blemish.
Thou shalt not reprove him mocking, lest he shall hate thee: reprove to the wise one and he will love thee.
Thou shalt give to the wise one and he will be more wise: make known to the just one and he will add receiving.
The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah, and the knowledge of the holy ones is understanding.
For in me thy days shall be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.
If thou wert wise, thou wert wise for thyself: and thou mockedst, thou alone shalt suffer.
A woman of folly being noisy, simple, and she knew not anything.
And sitting at the door of her house, upon the throne of the heights of the city,
To call to those passing the way, making straight their paths:
Who is simple, he shall turn aside here: and he wanting heart, and she said to him,
Stolen waters will be sweet, and the bread of secrets shall be pleasant.
And he knew not that there the shades; her called ones in the depths of hades.

The king judging the poor in truth, his throne shall be established for a testimony.
The rod and reproofs will give wisdom: and the youth being left shames his mother.
In increasing the unjust, transgressions will increase: and the just all look upon their fall.
Correct thy son and he shall cause thee to rest, and he shall give delight to thy soul.
In no vision the people shall be unruly: and he watching the law, happy is he.
A servant will not be corrected by words: for he will understand and not answer.
Thou sawest a man hasty in his words: hope to the foolish one more than to him.
He bringing up his servant delicately from youth, and his latter state will be a child.
A man of anger will excite strife, and the possessor of wrath increased transgression.
A man's pride shall bring him low: and honor shall uphold him humble of spirit.
He dividing with a thief, hates his soul: he shall hear cursing and shall not announce.
The fear of man will give a snare: and he trusting in Jehovah shall be exalted.
Many are seeking the face of the ruler, and from Jehovah a man's judgment.
A man of iniquity is an abomination of the just; and the upright of way, an abomination of the unjust one.
The words of Agur, son of Jakeh: the lifting up: the declaration of the man to Ithiel; to Ithiel and Ucal:
For I am brutish more than man, and not the understanding of a man to me.
I learnt not wisdom, and I shall not know the knowledge of the holy.
Who went up to the heavens, and came down? who gathered the wind in his fists? who bound the waters in a garment? who set up all the ends of the earth? what his name and what his son's name, if thou shalt know?
All the word of God is purified: he a shield to those trusting in him.
Thou shalt not add to his words lest he reprove in thee, and thou wert false.
Two things I asked from thee, thou wilt not withhold from me before I shall die:
Vanity and the word of falsehood remove far from me; thou wilt not give to me poverty and riches; feed me with bread of my allowance:
Lest I shall be filled and I spake lies, and said, Who is Jehovah? and lest I shall be dispossessed and I stole, and I laid hold upon the name of God.
Thou shalt not slander the servant to his lord lest he shall curse thee, and thou wert guilty.
A generation will curse its father, and will not bless its mother.
A generation pure in its eyes, and not washed from its finding.
A generation, how its eyes were raised up and its eyelashes will be lifted up.
A generation, its teeth swords, and its biter's teeth, knives, to devour the poor from the land, and the needy from man.
To the leech two daughters: Give, give. Behold, three shall not satisfied; four shall not say, Wealth:
Hades; and the closed womb; the earth not filled with water; and fire said not, Wealth.
The eye shall mock to his father, and despise to obey the mother, the ravens of the valley shall bore it out and the sons of the eagle shall eat it.
They three were wonderful above me; and four, I knew them not:
The way of the eagle in the heavens; the way of the serpent upon the rock; the way of the ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
So the way of a woman committing adultery; eating and wiping her mouth, and saying, I transgressed not.
For three the earth was moved, and for four, which it shall not be able to lift up:
For a servant when he shall reign; and the foolish one when he shall be filled with bread;
For a hated woman when she shall be married and a maid when she shall inherit to her mistress.
They four the small of the earth, and they are wise, being made wise:
The ants a people not strong, and they will prepare their bread in the summer;
The rabbits a people not strong, and they will set their house in the rock;
To the locust no king, and it will go forth divided all of them;
The lizard will take hold with their hands, and it is in the temples of the king.
They three making good the step, and four, making good to go:
The lion strong among cattle, and he will not turn back from the face of all;
One girded in loins, or a he goat; and a king, no rising up with him.
If thou wert foolish in lifting up thyself, and if thou purposed, the hand to the mouth.
For the pressure of milk will bring forth cheese, and the pressure of the nose will bring forth blood: and the pressure of wrath will, bring forth contention.
The words of Lemuel the king, the lifting up which his mother will instruct him.
What, my son? and what the son of my womb? and what the son of my vows?
Thou shalt not give thy strength to women, and thy ways to the destroying of kings.
Not for kings, O Lemuel, not for kings to drink and for princes the desire of strong drink:
Lest he shall drink and forget what is prescribed, and change the judgment of all the sons of affliction.
Ye shall give strong drink to him perishing, and wine to the bitter of soul.
He shall drink and forget his poverty, and shall no more remember his toil.
Open thy mouth for the dumb, for the judgment of all the sons of the surviving.
Open thy mouth; judge justly, and contend for the poor and needy.
Who shall find a woman of virtue? for her price is far above pearls.
The heart of her husband trusted in her, and he shall not want spoil.
She rewarded him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She sought wool and flax, and she will work in delight with her hands.
She was as the ships of the merchant; from far off she will bring her bread.
She will rise while yet night, and she will give food to her house, and a portion to her girls.
She purposed a field, and he will take it: from the fruit of her hands she planted a vineyard.
She girded her loins with strength, and she will strengthen her arms.
She tasted that her traffic is good: her light will not go out by night.
She sent forth her hands upon the spindle, and her hands take hold of the whirl.
She spread forth her hands to the poor, and sent forth her hands to the needy.
She will not fear for her house from snow, for all her house put on double.
She made for herself coverings; byssus and purple her clothing.
Her husband was known in the gates, in his sitting with the old men of the land.
She made the under garment, and she will sell; and she gave a girdle to the Canaanite.
Strength and ornament her clothing; and she will laugh to the last day.
She opened her mouth in wisdom, and the law of mercy upon her tongue.
She viewed the goings of her house, and the bread of sloth she will not eat.
Her sons rose up and they will call her happy; her husband, and he will praise her.
Many daughters did virtue, and thou wentest up over all of them.
Favor a falsehood, and beauty vanity: a woman fearing Jehovah, she shall be praised.
Ye shall give her from the fruit of her hands, and her works shall praise her in the gates.
The words of the preacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.
Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; vanity of vanities, all vanity.
What the profit to a man in all the labor he will labor under the sun?
A generation went away, and a generation came: and the earth stood forever.
The sun arose and the sun went down, and panted after its place which it arose there.
Going to the south and turning round about to the north, it turned round about; the wind turned round about, going, and the wind turned back upon its circuits.
All the torrents going into the sea, and the sea not full: to the place the torrents going, there they turn back to go.
All words becoming weary; man shall not be able to speak: the eye shall not be satisfied to see, and the ear shall not be filled from hearing.
What was, that shall be; and what was done, that shall be done: and not anything new under the sun.
Is there a word will be said, See, this is new? This was already to a long time which was before us.
No remembrance to former things; and also to the latter things that shall be; to them shall be no remembrance with them which shall be for the latter state.
I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I gave my heart to seek and to search out in wisdom concerning all which was done under the heavens: this evil business God gave to the sons of man to be occupied in it.
I saw all the works they did under the sun; and behold, all vanity and striving of the spirit.
The crooked thing shall not be able to be made straight: and the deficiency shall not be able to be numbered.
It spake with my heart, saying, Behold, I was magnified, and added wisdom over all that were before me at Jerusalem: and my heart saw much of wisdom and knowledge.
And I will give my heart to know wisdom, and the knowledge of praise and understanding: I knew this also it is the striving of the spirit.
For in abundance of wisdom, abundance of trouble: and he adding knowledge will increase pain.
I said in my heart, Go now, I will prove thee with gladness, and look thou upon good: and behold, this also vanity.
To laughter I said, It is mad: and to gladness, What did this?
I examined in my heart to draw my flesh with wine, and my heart led in wisdom; and to lay hold upon folly till that I shall see what this good to the sons of man which they will do under the heavens the number of the days of their life.
I magnified my work; I builded to me houses; I planted to me vineyards:
I made to me gardens and pleasure grounds, and I planted in them a tree of all fruit.
I made to me pools of waters to water from them the forest, causing trees to spring forth.
I obtained servants and maids, and sons of the house were to me; also obtaining cattle, and many sheep were to me more than all that were before me in Jerusalem.
I gathered to me also silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and the provinces: I made to me men singing and women singing, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and mistresses.
And I was magnified and increased more than all being before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom stood to me.
And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them, and I withheld not my heart from all gladness; for my heart rejoiced from all my labor: and this was my portion from all my labor.
And I looked upon all my works my hands made, and upon the labor I labored to do, and behold, all vanity and striving of the spirit, and no profit under the sun.
And I turned to see wisdom, madness, and folly: for what the man that shall come after the king? with those things they did already.
And I saw there is profit to wisdom more than to folly, as the excellence of the light above darkness.
The wise, his eyes in his head; and the foolish one goes in darkness: and I knew, I also, that one event will meet with them all.
And I said in my heart, As the event of the foolish one, also I, it will meet me; and wherefore then was I more wise? And I spake in my heart, This is also vanity.
For no remembrance for the wise with the foolish one forever, since in the days coming, all being forgotten. And how will the wise die? with the foolish one.
And I hated life, for evil to me the work done under the sun: for all vanity and striving of the spirit.
And I hated all my labor I laboring under the sun: leaving it to the man who shall come after me.
And who shall know whether he shall be wise or foolish? And he shall have dominion over all my labor which I labored, and was wise under the sun. Also this is vanity.
And I turned about to let my heart despair for all the labor I labored under the sun.
For there is man his labor in wisdom, and in knowledge and in success; and to man not laboring in it he shall give his portion. Also this is vanity and much evil.
For what was to man in all his labor, and in the striving of his heart, he labored under the sun?
For all his days pains, and vexation, his labor; also in the night his heart rested not Also this it is vanity.
Not good in man he shall eat and drink and cause his soul to see good in his labor. Also this I saw that it is from the hand of God.
For who shall eat, and who shall hasten forth above me?
For to a man good before his face, he gave wisdom and knowledge and gladness: and to him sinning, he gave labor, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good one before the face of God. Also this is vanity and the striving of the spirit.
To all a season, and a time to every inclination under the heavens:
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up the planting.
A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build:
A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance:
A time to cast away stones, and a time to collect stones a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing:
A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to watch, and a time to cast away.
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak:
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace:
What the excellence of him working in what he labored?
I saw the labor which God gave to the sons of man to be humbled in it.
He made everything beautiful in his time: also he gave hidden time in their heart, so that man shall not find the work which God did from the beginning and even to the end.
I knew that no good is in them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.
And also every man shall eat and drink, and see the good in all his labor; it is the gift of God.
I knew that all which God will do it shall be forever: to it not to be added, and from it not to be taken away: and God doing they shall be afraid from his face.
What was, it is already; and what to be, was already; and God will seek him being driven away.
And yet I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there the unjust one; and the place of the just one, there the unjust one.
I said in my heart, The just one and the unjust one, God will judge: for a time for every inclination and for every work there.
I said in my heart concerning the speeches of the sons of man, for God to separate them, and for them to see that they are cattle to themselves.
For the event of the sons of man, and the event of the cattle, one event to them: as this, so dies this; and the breath of one to all; and the preeminence of man not above the cattle: for all is vanity.
All go to one place; all were from dust, and all turned back to dust.
Who shall know the spirit of the sons of man? it ascending to above, and the spirit of cattle, it going downwards to the earth.
And I saw that no good more than that man shall rejoice in his works; for this is his portion: for who shall bring him to look upon what shall be after him?
And I turned back, and I shall see all the oppressions which are doing under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforting to them; and from the hand of those oppressing them was power, and none comforting to them.
And I praise the dead already dead more than the living they yet living.
And good above them two which were not yet, which saw not the evil work which was done under the sun.
And I saw all the labor and all the success of the work, for this the jealousy of a man from his neighbor. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.
The foolish one folded his hands together, and ate his flesh.
Good a hand filled with rest, above two hands full of labor and striving of spirit.
And I turned back, and I shall see vanity under the sun.
There is one, and not a second; also a son and brother not to him: and no end to all his labor; also his eye shall not be satisfied with riches: and for whom do I labor and diminish my soul from good? Also this is vanity, and it is an evil labor.
Two are good above one, because there is to them a good reward in their labor.
For if they shall fall, the one will raise up his companion: and wo to him, the one that shall fall, and not a second to raise him up.
Also if two shall lie down, and heat to them: and to the one it shall not be warm.
And if one shall become strong against him, two shall stand before him; and a three-fold thread shall not be quickly broken.
Good a poor and wise child above an old and foolish king, who knew not more to receive instruction.
For from the house of those turning away he came forth to reign; for also he being born in his kingdom became poor.
I saw all the living going under the sun, with the second child which shall stand in his stead.
No end to all the people, to all which were before them: also the last ones shall not rejoice in him. For also this is vanity and striving of the spirit.
Watch thy feet when thou shalt go to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than give the sacrifice of the foolish, for they not knowing the doing of evil.
Thou shalt not hasten with thy mouth, and thy heart shall not be quick to bring forth a word to the face of God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon the earth: for this thy words shall be few.
For the dream came in the multitude of labor; and the voice of the foolish one in the multitude of words.
When thou shalt vow a vow to God, thou shalt not delay to repay it; for there is no desire in the foolish: repay what thou shalt vow.
Good that thou shalt not vow rather than thou shalt vow and not requite.
Thou shalt not give thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; and thou shalt not say to the face of the messenger that it is an error: wherefore shall God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?
For in the multitude of dreams, and vanities, and many words: but fear thou God.
If thou shalt see the oppression of the poor one, and the spoiling of judgment and justice in a province, thou shalt not wonder at the inclination: for the high one above the high one is watching, and the high ones over them.
And the profit of the earth in all: it is the king being served to the field.
He loving silver shall not be satisfied with silver; and whoever loved not the increase with the multitude. Also this is vanity.
In the multitude of good they were multiplied eating it: and what the success to its possessors but seeing with his eyes?
The sleep of the servant is sweet, if little, or if much he shall eat: and the satiety to the rich not permitting to him to sleep.
There is an evil making sick I saw under the sun: riches watched to its owners for their evil.
And those riches shall perish by evil labor: and he begetting a son, and not anything in his hand.
According as he came forth from his mother's womb, naked he shall turn back to go as he came, and he shall not take away anything in his labor that shall go in his hand.
And also this an evil making sick, wholly as he came so shall he go: and what to him he shall labor for the wind?
Also all his days in darkness shall he eat, and much vexation and his sickness and his anger.
Behold, what I saw: good, which is beautiful to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he will labor under the sun the number of the days of his life, which God gave to him; for this his portion.
Also every man which God gave to him wealth and riches, and permitted him to eat from it, and to lift up his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this the gift of God himself.
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; for God humbles him in the gladness of his heart.
There is evil which I saw under the sun, and it is much upon man:
A man which God will give to him wealth and riches and honor, and wanting not to his soul from all which he shall desire, and God will not permit him to eat from it, for a man, a stranger shall eat it. This is vanity and it is an evil disease.
If a man shall beget a hundred, and live many years, and a multitude shall be the days of his years, and his soul shall not be satisfied from good, and also there was no burial to him; I said, Good above him an abortion.
For in vanity he came, and in darkness he will go away, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
Also he saw not the sun, and he knew not rest to this above this.
And although he lived a thousand years twice, and he saw not good. Did not all go to one place?
All the labor of man for his mouth, and also the soul shall not be filled.
For what will remain to the wise one more than the foolish one? what to the poor that shall know to go before the living.
Good the sight of the eyes above the going of the soul. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.
What was, its name was called already, and it was known that it is man: and he shall not be able to contend with the powerful above him.
For there is many words increasing vanity, what shall remain to man?
For who shall know what is for man in life, the number of the days of the life of his vanity, and he will make them as a shadow? for who shall announce to man what shall be after him under the sun?
A good name is above good oil, and the day of death above the day of birth.
Good to go to the house of mourning rather than to go to the house of drinking, in that it is the end of every man; and he living shall give to his heart.
Good is grief above laughter: for in the illness of the face the heart shall be good.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; and the heart of the foolish in the house of gladness.
Good to hear the reproof of the wise one, above a man hearing the song of the foolish:
For as the voice of thorns under the pot, so the laughter of the foolish one. Also this is vanity.
For oppression will make foolish the wise one; and a gift will destroy the heart.
Good the last of a word above its beginning: good slowness of spirit above pride of spirit.
Thou shalt not be hastened in thy spirit to be angry, for anger shall rest in the bosom of fools.
Thou shalt not say, Why was it the former days were good above these? for thou didst not ask from wisdom concerning this.
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and a remainder to those seeing the sun.
For in the shadow, wisdom; in the shadow, silver: and the excellence of knowledge is wisdom shall preserve alive those possessing it.
See the work of God: for who shall be able to make straight what he made it crooked?
In the day of good, be in good; and in the day of evil, see thou: also God made this over against this, to the end that man shall not find anything after him.
I saw all in the days of my vanity: there is a just one perishing in his justice, and there is an unjust one, being prolonged in his evil.
Thou shalt not be greatly just; and thou shalt not be exceedingly wise: wherefore wilt thou be made desolate?
Thou shalt not be greatly wicked, and thou shalt not be foolish: wherefore wilt thou die not in thy time?
Good that thou shalt hold fast upon this; also from this thou shalt not lead away thy hand: for he fearing God shall come forth with all of them.
Wisdom shall strengthen to the wise one more than ten having power which were in the city.
For not a just man in the earth, who shall do good and not sin.
Also to all the words that shall be spoken thou shalt not give thy heart, that thou shalt not hear thy servant cursing thee.
For also many times thy heart knew that thou didst also curse others.
All this I proved by wisdom: I said I will be wise, and it was removed far off from me.
What was far off, and the depth, deep, who shall find it?
I went round about, I and my heart, to know, and to examine, and to search out wisdom and understanding, and to know the injustice of folly, and the folly of wickedness:
And I find bitter above death the woman that her heart it is snares and nets, her hands are bonds: the good one before God shall escape from her, and he sinning shall be taken by her.
See, this I found, said the preacher: one to one to find understanding.
Which yet my soul sought, and found not; one man from a thousand I found; and a woman in all these I found not.
Only see, this I found, that God made man upright; and they sought out many purposes.
Who as the wise one? and who will know the interpretation of the word? The wisdom of man shall enlighten his face, and the hard of face shall be hated.
I am to watch the king's mouth by reason of the oath of God.
Thou shalt not hasten going from his face: thou shalt not stand by the word of evil; for he shall do all that he will desire.
Wheresoever the word of a king, it is powerful: and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?
He watching the command knew no evil word: and time and judgment the wise one will know.
To every inclination there is time and judgment; for man's evil is great upon him.
For he will not know what shall be: for as it shall be who shall announce to him?
No man having power in spirit to restrain the spirit: and no power in the day of death: and no sending forth in war; and injustice shall not deliver its possessors.
All this I saw, and giving my heart to every work which was done under the sun: a time which man had power over man for evil to him.
And so then I saw the unjust buried, and they came and they will go from the holy place, and they will be forgotten in the city where they did thus: also this is vanity.
Because a decree was not done quickly upon an evil work, for this the heart of the sons of man was filled in them to do evil.
Whoever sinned, doing evil a hundred, and it being prolonged to him, for also I know that it will be to those fearing God, who shall be afraid from his face.
And it shall not be good to the unjust one; he shall not lengthen the days as a shadow, for he feared not from before the face of God.
There is vanity which was done upon the earth; that there is the just which it comes upon them according to the work of the unjust: and there is the unjust, it comes upon them according to the work of the just. I said, Also this is vanity.
And I praised joy, because there is no good to man under the sun but to eat and to drink, and to rejoice: for this shall lodge with him in his labor the days of his life which God gave to him under the sun.
According as I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the labor that was done upon the earth: for also in the day and in the night he saw not sleep with his eyes.
And I saw all the work of God, that no man shall be able to find out the work that was done under the sun in whatsoever a man shall labor to seek out, and he shall not find: and also if the wise one shall say to know, he shall not be able to find.
For all this I gave to my heart, and to examine all this, that the just and the wise and their works are in the hand of God: also love, also hatred, no man shall know of all before them.
All according to all: one event to the just one and to the unjust one; to the good one and to the clean one, and to the unclean one; to him sacrificing and to him not sacrificing: as the good one, so the sinning one; he swearing, as he who shall fear an oath.
This an evil in all being done under the sun, thus one event is to all: and also the heart of the sons of man being full of evil, and folly in their heart in their living, and after it to their deaths.
For whoever shall choose to all the living there is hope: for to a living dog it is good above a dead lion.
For the living know they shall die: and the dead know not any thing, and no more to them a reward; for their remembrance was forgotten.
Also their love, also their hatred, also their envy perished already; and no more portion to them forever in all which was done under the sun.
Go eat in joy thy bread, and drink thy wine in a good heart; for already God was satisfied with thy works.
In all time thy garments shall be white; and ointment shall not be wanting upon thy head.
See life with the wife which thou didst love all the days of the life of thy vanity which he gave to thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for this thy portion in life, and in thy labor which thou laborest under the sun.
All which thy hand shall find to do, with thy strength, do thou; for no work and understanding and knowledge and wisdom, in hades where thou goest there.
I turned back, and saw under the sun that not to the fleet the race, and the war not to the strong, and also not to the wise, bread; and also not to the understanding ones, riches; and also not to the knowing, favor; for time and chance will light upon all of them.
For also man knew not his time: as the fishes being laid hold of in an evil net, and as the birds laid hold of in the snare, as they, the sons of men being snared for an evil time, as it will fall upon them suddenly.
Also this I saw, the wisdom under the sun, and it was great to me:
A little city, and men in it few; and a great king came against it, and surrounded it, and built against it great entrenchments:
And a poor wise man was found in it, and he delivered the city by his wisdom; and not a man remembered that poor man.
And I said, Wisdom is good above strength: and the wisdom of the poor one was despised, and his words not heard.
The words of the wise being heard in quiet more than the cry of him ruling among the foolish.
Wisdom is good above the instruments of encounter: and one sinning will destroy much good.
Flies of death will cause the oil of the perfume to stink, it will ferment: the preciousness of wisdom above the honor of the least folly.
The heart of the wise one to his right, and the heart of the foolish one to his left.
And also as the foolish one went in the way, his heart was wanting, and he said to all, It is folly.
If the spirit of him ruling shall go up against thee, thou shalt not leave thy place; for quietness will put down great sins.
There is an evil I saw under the sun as an error going forth from before him having power:
Folly was given to great heights, and the rich were set in lowness.
I saw servants upon horses, and chiefs going as servants upon the earth.
He digging a ditch shall fall into it; he breaking down a wall, a serpent shall bite him.
He removing stones; shall suffer pain by them; and he cleaving woods asunder shall be endangered by them.
If the iron became dull and he polished not the face, and he will strengthen the forces: and wisdom will make preeminence to prosper.
If a serpent will bite without magic; and no preeminence to the possessor of the tongue.
The words of the wise one's mouth, grace; and the lips of the foolish one shall swallow him down.
The beginning of the words of his mouth, folly: and the latter state of his mouth the folly of evil.
And the foolish one will multiply words: man shall not know what shall be; and what shall be after him, who shall announce to him?
The labor of the foolish will weary them, because he knew not to go to the city.
Wo! to thee, O land: thy king a youth, and thy chiefs will eat in the morning.
Happy thou, O land: thy king the son of nobles, and thy chiefs shall eat in time, in strength and not in drinking.
By sloth the frame work will pine away; and by the letting down of the hands, the house will drop.
For laughter they make bread, and wine will gladden the living: and silver will answer with all.
Thou shalt not curse the king in thy consciousness, and in thy bed-chamber thou shalt not curse the rich for the bird of the heavens will bring the voice, and the possessor of wings shall announce the word.
Send forth thy bread upon the face of the waters, for in a multitude of days thou shalt find it.
Thou shalt give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou shalt not know what shall be evil upon the earth.
If the clouds shall be filled with rain, they shall pour out upon the earth: and if the tree shall fall in the south or in the north, the place the tree shall fall, there it shall be.
He watching the wind shall not sow; and he looking in the clouds, shall not reap.
As thou wilt not know what the way of the spirit, as the bones in the womb of her being filled, so thou shalt not know the work of God who will make all.
In the morning sow thy seed, and at evening thou shalt not let thy hand rest: for thou shalt not know whether this shall be right, this or that, or if they two as one being good.
And the light is sweet, and good to the eyes to see the sun:
If man shall live many years, in them all shall he rejoice; and he shall remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. All coming is vanity.
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and thy heart shall do thee good in the days of thy youth, and go in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: and know thou, that for all these God will bring thee into judgment.
And put away anger from thy heart, and cause evil to pass away from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.
And remember him creating thee in the days of thy youth, till even when the days of evil shall not come, and the years draw near in which thou shalt say, Not to me delight in them;
Till when the sun shall not be darkened, and the light, and the moon, and the stars, and the clouds turned not back after the rain:
In the day those watching the house shall tremble, and the strong men bent themselves, and the grinders ceased for they were few, and they looking through the lattice were darkened,
And the doors were shut in the street, in the lowness of the voice of the grinding, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of the song shall bow down;
Also from height they shall be afraid, and being dismayed in the way, and the almond tree shall be despised, and the locust shall become a burden, and the caperberry shall fail: for man shall go to his eternal house, and they mourning, went about in the street:
Till when the cord of silver shall be removed far off, and the bowl of gold be broken, and the bucket shall be broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the cistern.
And the dust shall turn back to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall turn back to God who gave it.
Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; all is vanity.
And besides, the preacher was wise; he yet taught the people knowledge; and he gave ear, and sought out, setting in order many parables.
The preacher sought to find words: of delight: and that written was straight, words of truth.
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails planted of the masters of the gatherings; they were given from one shepherd.
And besides, from these, my son, beware: of making many books, no end; and much study wearies the flesh.
We will hear the end of all the word: Fear thou God, and watch his commands: for this is all man.
For God will bring every work into judgment, with every thing hidden, whether good, and whether evil.
The song of songs which is to Solomon.
He shall kiss me from the kisses of his mouth: for thy good breasts are above wine.
To the odor of the good ointments thy name shall be poured forth an ointment; for this, the maidens loved thee.
Draw me, we will run after thee: the king brought me to his chambers: we will exult and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy breasts above wine: the upright loved thee.
I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
Thou shalt not see me, I am black; the sun searched me: my mother's sons were angry with me; they set me to watch the vineyards; my vineyard I watched not for me.
Announce to me, thou whom my soul loved, where thou wilt feed, where thou wilt lie down at noon: wherefore shall I be as he covered by the herds of thy companions.
If thou shalt not know for thyself, O fair one among women, come forth for thyself at the heels of the flock, and feed thy kids by the shepherds tents.
To my mares in Pharaoh's chariots I likened thee, O my neighbor.
Thy cheeks were beautiful with with rows, thy neck with strings of pearls.
We will make for thee rows of gold, with marks of silver.
The king yet in his divan, my spikenard gave its odor.
A bundle of myrrh my beloved to me; he shall lodge between my breasts.
A cluster of cypress my beloved to me in the vineyards of the kids fountain.
Behold thee fair, my friend; behold thee beautiful; thine eyes are doves'.
Behold thee beautiful, my beloved, also pleasant: also our bed is green.
The walls of our houses cedars, our carved ceilings, cypresses.
I am the flower of the plain, the lily of the valleys.
As the lily between thorns, so is my friend between the daughters.
As the apple among the trees of the forest, so my beloved between the sons. In his shadow I delighted, and I sat down, and his fruit was sweet to my palate.
He brought me to the house of wine, and his banner over me was love.
Sustain me with cakes, and refresh me with apples, for I am pierced of love.
His left hand is under my head, and his right shall embrace me.
I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, if ye shall awake and if ye shall arouse love till he shall desire.
The voice of my beloved I behold him coming leaping upon the mountains, springing upon the hills.
My beloved is like to the roe or to the fawn of the hinds: behold him standing behind our wall looking forth from the windows, glancing from the lattices.
My beloved answered and said to me, Rise up for thyself, my friend, my beautiful one, and go for thyself.
For behold, the winter passed away, the rain glided away; it went for itself.
The flowers were seen in the earth; the time of pruning came, and the voice of the turtle-dove was heard in our land.
The fig tree ripened its unripe figs, and the vines are in blossom; they gave an odor. Rise up, my friend, my beautiful one, and go for thyself.
My dove in the refuges of the rock, in the biding of the steep mountain: cause me to see thy form, cause me to hear thy voice; for thy voice is sweet and thy form becoming.
Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes destroying the vineyards: and our vineyards are in blossom.
My beloved to me, and I to him: he feeding among the lilies.
Until the day shall breathe and the shadows fled away, turn, thou, it being likened to thee, my beloved, to the roe, or to the fawn of the hind upon the mountains of section.
Upon my bed in the night I sought him whom my soul loved: I sought him, and I found him not.
I will arise now, and I will go round about in the city; in the streets, and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loved. I sought him, and I found him not.
They watching going about in the city, found me: Saw ye him that my soul loved?
As a little I passed from them till I found him my soul loved: I held him fast, and I shall not let him go till I brought him into my mother's house, and to the chamber of her conceiving me.
I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, if ye shall awake and if ye shall arouse love till he shall desire.
Who is this coming up from the desert as columns of smoke of burning incense, of myrrh and frankincense from all the powder of the trader.
Behold his bed of Solomon: sixty strong ones round about it from the strong ones of Israel.
All of them holding the sword, being trained to war: each his sword upon his thigh from terror in the night.
King Solomon made for himself a litter from the woods of Lebanon.
Its pillars he made silver, its support gold, its seat reddish purple, its midst tesselated with love from the daughters of Jerusalem.
Go forth, ye daughters of Zion, and look upon king Solomon; upon the crown his mother crowned to him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
Behold thee beautiful, my friend, behold thee beautiful; thine eyes doves from behind to thy veil: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from mount Gilead.
Thy teeth as a herd of the shorn which came up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.
As a scarlet thread thy lips, and thy speech becoming: as a piece of pomegranate, thy temples from behind thy veil.
As the tower of David thy neck, built for the weapons; a thousand shields hung upon it, all shields of the powerful.
Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe deer feeding among the lilies.
Till the day shall breathe, and the shadows fled away, I will go for myself to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of Lebanon.
All of thee beautiful, my friend, and no blemish in thee.
Thou shalt come with me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon: thou shalt go round about from the head of faith, from the head of Shenir and Hermon, from the dwellings of lions, from the mountains of panthers.
Thou didst rob me of the heart, my sister, O bride; thou didst rob me of the heart with one of thine eyes, with one necklace of thy neck.
How beautiful were thy breasts, my sister, O bride! how good were thy breasts above wine, and the odor of thine ointments above all spices.
Thy lips will drop honey droppings, O bride: honey and milk under thy tongue, and the odor of thy garments as the odor of Lebanon.
A garden shut up, my sister, O bride; a reservoir shut up, a fountain sealed.
Thy sendings forth a park of pomegranates, with most precious fruits, cypresses with spikenards,
Spikenard and saffron; the reed and cinnamon, with all the woods of Lebanon; myrrh and aloes, with all the heads of spices.
A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and flowings from Lebanon.
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south, blow upon my garden; its spices shall flow out. My beloved shall come to his garden, and he shall eat his most precious fruits.
I Came to my garden, my sister, O spouse: I gathered my myrrh with my spices; I ate my droppings with my honey; I drank my wine with my milk: Eat, O friends; drink ye, and drink to the full, O beloved ones.
I slept and my heart waked: the voice of my beloved knocks at the door; Open to me, my sister, my friend, my dove, my perfect one: my head was filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.
I put off my tunic, and how shall I put it on? I washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
My beloved sent his hand from the hole, and my bowels were disquieted for him.
I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped myrrh, and my fingers, myrrh overflowing upon the hands of the bolt.
I opened to my beloved, and my beloved turned about, he passed away: my soul went forth in his speaking: I sought and I found him not; I called him and he answered me not.
They watching going round about in the city, found me; they struck me, they wounded me: they watching the wall took away my veil from me.
I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye shall find my beloved, what ye shall announce to him: I am pierced by love.
What is thy beloved above the beloved, O beautiful one among women? What thy beloved above the beloved, that thou didst thus adjure us?
My beloved is white and ruddy, bearing the standard of ten thousand.
His head purified gold, his locks waving branches, black as a raven.
His eyes as doves upon channels of waters washed with milk, sitting upon fulness.
His cheeks as beds of spices, towers of aromatic herbs: his lips lilies, dropping overflowing myrrh.
His hands rings of gold completed in Tarshish: his bowels wrought ivory covered over with sapphires.
His legs bases of white marble, founded upon of pure gold: his aspect as Lebanon, choice as the cedars.
His palate, sweetness: he is all loveliness. This my beloved, and this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
Where went thy beloved, O beautiful one among women? where turned away thy beloved, and we will seek him with thee.
My beloved went down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
I to my beloved, and my beloved to me: he feeding among the lilies.
Thou art beautiful my friend, as delight; becoming as Jerusalem, a terror as those being furnished with banners.
Turn away thine eyes from before me; they enlarged me: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from Gilead.
Thy teeth as a herd of sheep which went up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.
As a piece of pomegranate thy temples from behind thy veil.
They are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens no number.
She is one, my dove, my perfect one; she is one to her mother, she is the chosen to her bearing her. The daughters saw her and pronounced her happy; the queens and the concubines, and they will praise her.
Who this looking forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, a terror as those being furnished with banners?
I went down into the garden of nuts to look upon the greens of the valley, to see whether the vine was fruitful, whether the pomegranates blossomed.
I knew not my soul set me the chariots of my willing people.
Turn back, turn back, thou Shulamite; turn back, turn back, and we will look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As the stringed instrument of the camps.
How beautiful were thy steps with shoes, O daughter of a noble! the circuits of thy thighs a necklace, the work of the hands of an artist.
Thy navel a bowl of roundness, it will not want mixed wine; thy belly a heap of wheat enclosed with lilies.
Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe-deer.
Thy neck as a tower of ivory; thine eyes pools in Heshbon, by the gate of the daughter of many: thy nose as the tower of Lebanon viewing the face of Damascus.
Thy head upon thee as Carmel, and the locks of thy head as purple; the King being bound in curls.
How beautiful and how pleasant thou wert, O love, in delights!
This thy height was like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters.
I said, I will go up upon the palm tree, I will hold fast upon its branches: and now thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the odor of thy nose as apples.
And thy palate as good wine going to my beloved for uprightness, causing the lips of the sleeping to flow softly.
I to my beloved, and upon me his desire.
Come, my beloved, we will go forth to the field; we will lodge in the villages.
We will rise early to the vineyards; we will see if the vine was fruitful, the vine blossoms opened, the pomegranates blossomed: there will I give my beloved to thee.
The mandrakes gave an odor, and upon our entrances all precious things, new also old, my beloved, I laid up for thee.
Who will give thee as a brother to me, sucking the breasts of my mother? I shall find thee without, I shall kiss thee; also they shall not despise me.
I will lead thee, I will bring thee to the house of my mother; thou wilt teach me: I will give thee to drink from spiced wine from the new wine of my pomegranate.
His left hand under my head, and his right shall embrace me.
I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, why will ye awake, and why will ye rouse love till he shall desire?
Who this coming up from the desert, leaning herself upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused thee: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she bearing thee, brought forth.
Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love was strong as death; jealousy hard as hades: its flames, flames of fire, flames of Jehovah.
Many waters shall not be able to quench love, and rivers shall not overwhelm it: if a man shall give all the riches of his house for love, despising, they shall be despised for him.
A little sister to us, and no breasts to her: what shall we do for our sister in the day it shall be spoken for her?
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a fortress of silver: and if she is a door we will bind upon her a tablet of cedar.
I am a wall, and my breasts as towers: then was I in his eyes as finding peace.
A vineyard was to Solomon in the place of a multitude; he gave the vineyards to those watching; each shall bring in its fruit a thousand of silver.
My vineyard to me before me: a thousand to thee, O Solomon, and two hundred to those watching its fruit.
Thou sitting in the gardens, the companions attending to thy voice: cause thou me to hear.
Flee, my beloved, and be it likened to thee to the roe or to the fawn of the hinds upon the mountains of spices.
The vision of Isaiah son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Hear, ye heavens, and give ear thou earth, for Jehovah spake: for I caused to grow and lifted up sons, and they rebelled against me.
The ox knew his possessor, and the ass his lord's stall: Israel knew not; my people understood not.
Wo! sinful nation, a people heavy with sin, a seed doing evil, sons acting wickedly; they forsook Jehovah; they despised the holy one of Israel; they separated themselves backward.
For what shall ye be yet struck? will ye add apostasy? every head for sickness, and every heart sick.
From the sole of the foot and even to the head, no wholeness in it; a wound and bruise, and a fresh blow: they were not pressed out, and they were not bound up, and they were not softened with oil.
Your land made desolate, your cities burnt with fire, your land before your strangers eating it up, and made desolate, as the overthrow of strangers.
And the daughter of Zion was left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a field of cucumbers, as a city besieged.
Unless Jehovah of armies left to us an escaping so small, we were as Sodom and we were made like to Gomorrah.
Hear the word of Jehovah, ye leaders of Sodom: give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.
For what to me the multitude of your sacrifices? Jehovah will say: I was filled with the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fatlings; and I delighted not in the blood of bullocks, and of he lambs and of he goats.
When ye shall come to be seen before me who sought this from your hand to tread my enclosure.
Ye shall not add to bring gifts of iniquity; incense, this an abomination to me; the new moon and the Sabbath, the calling of the assembly; I shall not be able to bear vanity and restraining.
Your new moons and your appointments my soul hated; they were for a burden upon me; I was wearied to lift up.
And in the spreading forth of your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; also when ye shall multiply prayer I hear not: your hands were full of blood.
Wash ye, cleanse yourselves: turn away evil from your doings from before mine eyes; leave off the evil;
Learn to do good; seek out judgment, lead right the oppressor, judge the orphan, contend for the widow.
Come now we will confute together Jehovah will say: if your sins shall be as deep scarlet, they shall be white as snow; if they shall be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.
If ye shall be willing and hear, ye shall eat the good of the land.
And if ye shall refuse and rebel, ye shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
How was the faithful city for a harlot! I filled with judgment; justice will lodge in her; and now they are killing.
Thy silver was for dross, thy wine adulterated with water.
Thy chiefs turning away, and associates of thieves: every one loving a gift and following recompenses: the orphan they will not judge, and the cause of the widow will not come to them.
For this says the lord Jehovah of armies, the mighty one of Israel, Wo! I will take vengeance of mine adversaries, and I will avenge myself of mine enemies:
And I will turn back my hand upon thee, end I will straiten thy dross according to pureness, and I will remove all thine alloy:
And I will turn back thy judges as in the beginning, and thy counsellors as in the beginning: after this he shall call to thee, The city of justice, the faithful city.
Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her captivity with justice.
Breaking the transgressing and the sinning together, and they forsaking Jehovah shall be finished.
For they shall be ashamed of their mighty ones which ye desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens which ye chose.
For ye shall be as an oak the leaf withering, and as a garden which there no water to it.
And the strong was for tow, and his work for a spark, and they two were burnt together, and none quenching.
The word which Isaiah son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
And it was in the last days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be prepared upon the head of the mountains, and lifted up above the hills; and all nations flowed to it.
And many people went and said, Come, and we will go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us from his ways, and we will go in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
And he judged between the nations, and he will decide for many peoples: and they shall beat down their swords to plough-shares and their spears to pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall no more learn war.
O house of Jacob, come ye, and we will go in the light of Jehovah.
For thou didst cast out thy people the house of Jacob, for they were filled from the east, and practicing magic as the rovers, and they will strike hands with the children of strangers.
And their land shall be full of silver and gold, and no end to their treasures; and their land shall be full of horses, and no end to their chariots.
And their land will be full of nothings; they will worship to the work of their hand, to what their fingers made:
And man will bow down, and a man will humble himself, and thou shalt not lift up to them.
Go into the rock, and hide in the dust from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty.
The lofty eyes of man were humbled, and the height of men bowed down, and Jehovah alone was exalted in that day.
For the day to Jehovah of armies is upon all the haughty and the high, and upon all lifted up; and he was humbled:
And upon all the cedars of Lebanon being high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills being lifted up,
And upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,
And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all the flags of desire.
And the haughtiness of man was bowed down, and the height of man was humbled: and Jehovah alone was exalted in that day.
And the nothings he shall cause to wholly pass away.
And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the caverns of the dust, from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty in his rising to terrify the earth.
In that day man shall cast the nothings of his silver and the nothings of his gold which they made for him to worship, to the digging of moles and to bats.
To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the fissures of the rocks from the face of the fear of Jehovah, and from the splendor of his majesty in his rising to terrify the earth.
Cease to you from man of whom the breath is in his nose: for in what was he reckoned?
For behold, the Lord Jehovah of armies taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay, and the stay, all the stay of bread, and all the stay of water.
The strong one and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the divines, and the old man,
The captain of fifty and the elevated of face, and the counselor, and the wise of the artificers, and the intelligent one enchanting.
And I gave boys their chiefs, and the petulant shall rule over them.
And the people were pressed, man by man, and a man by his neighbor: the boy shall enlarge himself against the old man and the despised against the honorable.
For a man shall seize upon his brother of the house of his father, A garment to thee, thou shalt be chief to us, this ruin under thy hand:
He shall lift up in that day, saying, I will not be binding up; and in my house no bread and no garment: thou shalt not set me a chief of the people.
For Jerusalem was weak, and Judah fell: for their tongues and their doings are against Jehovah to embitter the eyes of his glory.
The withdrawing of their face answered against them; and they announced their sins as Sodom, and they covered not. Wo to their soul! for they rewarded evil to themselves.
Say to the just, that it is good that they shall eat the fruit of their doings.
Wo to the unjust! evil! for the reward of his hands shall be done to him.
My people, their tyrants from children, and women ruled over them. My people, they calling thee happy, causing to err; they destroyed the way of thy paths.
Jehovah stood up to contend and he stood to judge the peoples.
Jehovah will go into judgment with the old men of his people and his chiefs: and ye burnt up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.
Why will ye crush my people and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of armies.
And Jehovah will say, Because the daughters of Zion were lifted up, and they will go extending the neck and ogling their eyes, going and tripping their going, and binding back their feet:
And Jehovah made bald the crown of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah opened the redundance.
In that day Jehovah will turn away the ornament of the ankle bands, and the inter-weavings, and the crescents,
The drops, and the chains, and the veils,
The head-dresses and the step chains, and the girdles, and the houses of the soul, and the amulets.
The signet rings and the rings of the nose.
The costly garments and the cloaks, and the mantles, and the caskets.
The mirrors and the shirts and the turbans and the veils.
And it was instead of a sweet smell there shall be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of turned work, baldness, and instead of a variegated garment, a girding of sackcloth a brand instead of beauty.
Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy strength in the war.
And her entrances sighed and mourned; and being clean, she shall sit upon the earth.
And seven women shall lay hold upon one man in that day, saying, We will eat our bread, and we will be clothed with our garments: only thy name shall be called upon us to take away our reproach.
In that day shall the springing up of Jehovah be for beauty and for glory, and the fruit of the earth for majesty and for ornament, for the escaping of Israel.
And it was he being left in Zion and he remaining in Jerusalem, he shall say to him holy, all being written for their life in Jerusalem.
When Jehovah washed out the excrements of the daughters of Zion, and he shall cleanse the blood of Jerusalem from her midst with the spirit of judgment, and with the spirit of burning.
And Jehovah created upon all the foundation of mount Zion and upon all her convocation, a cloud by day, and smoke, and the shining of afire of flame by night: and upon all the glory a covering.
And a booth shall be for a shadow by day from heat, and for a refuge, and for a hiding place from the storm, and from rain.
I will sing now to my beloved a song of my love for his vineyard. There was a vineyard to my beloved in the horn of the son of oil:
And he will dig it up, and he will free it from stones, and he will plant it with a vine of purple grapes, and build a tower in its midst, and he will also hew out a wine-vat in it: and he will wait for grapes to be made, and it will make wild grapes.
And now, ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge ye now, between me and between my vineyard.
What to do more to my vineyard, and did I not in it? wherefore I waited for grapes to be made, and it will make wild grapes.
And now I will make known to you now what I do to my vineyard, taking away its hedge, and it was for consuming, breaking down its wall, and it was for a treading down.
And I will make it a desolation; it shall not be pruned and it shall not be dressed, and there came up sharp points and thorns: and upon the clouds I will command from raining rain upon it.
For the vineyard of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah the plant of his pleasures: and he will wait for judgment, and behold bloodshed; for justice, and behold a cry.
Wo to those touching house upon house, they will bring near field upon field, till no more place, and ye dwelt yourselves alone in the midst of the earth.
In the ears of Jehovah of armies, If not many houses shall be for desolation, great and good from none dwelling.
For ten measures of a vineyard shall make one bath, and the seed of an omer shall make an ephah.
Wo to those rising early in the morning, they will follow strong drink; remaining in the evening, wine will inflame them.
And there was the harp and the lyre, the drum and the pipe, and the wine of their drinking's: but the work of Jehovah they will not look at, and the work of his hands they saw not.
For this my people were carried into exile from not knowing; and their honor, men of famine, and their multitude dry with thirst.
For this, hades enlarged her soul, and opened wide her mouth without bound: and her honor shall go down, and her multitude, and her tumult, and he rejoicing, into her.
And man shall bow down, and man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled.
And Jehovah of armies shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God consecrated in justice.
And the lambs feed according to their word, and the deserts of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
Wo to those drawing iniquity with cords of evil, and sin as the cords of a wagon:
Saying, He shall hasten, he shall urge on his work, so that we shall see: and the counsel of the holy one of Israel shall draw near and come and we shall know.
Wo to those saying, to evil, good, and to the good, evil; putting darkness for light, and light for darkness; putting bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitten.
Wo to the wise in their eyes, and knowing before their face.
Wo to the strong to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink:
Justifying the unjust on account of a gift, and they will take away the justice of the just from him.
For this as the tongue of fire consumes the straw, and the dry grass of flame will collapse: their root shall be as rottenness, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of Jehovah of armies, and the saying of the Holy One of Israel they despised.
For this the anger of Jehovah was kindled against his people, and he will stretch forth his hand against them and strike them: and the mountains will be moved and their carcasses shall be as dung in the midst of the streets. In all this his anger was not turned back, and his hand was yet stretched out.
And he lifted up a signal to the nations from far off, and he hissed to them from the extremity of the earth; and behold, they shall come swift from haste.
None fainted, and none were weak among them; none shall slumber and none shall sleep; and the girdle of their loins was not loosed, and the thong of their shoes was not broken:
Whose arrows were sharpened, and all their bows bent, the hoofs of their horses were reckoned as the rock, and their wheels as the whirlwind.
The roaring to him as the lion, and he roared as the young lions: and they shall groan and shall lay hold of the prey, and it shall escape, and none delivering.
And they shall groan against them in that day as the groaning of the sea: and they looked to the land and, behold, straitened darkness, and the light darkened in its clouds.
In the year king Uzziah died, and I shall see Jehovah sitting upon his throne, high and lifted up, and his train filling the temple.
And seraphs standing from above to it; six wings, six wings to one; with two he will cover his face, and with two he will cover his feet, and with two he will fly.
And this called to this, and said, Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of armies: all the earth full of his glory.
The foundations of the thresholds will tremble from the voice calling, and the house will be filled with smoke.
And saying, Wo to me! for I was cut off; because I a man of unclean lips, and in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell: for mine eyes saw the king, Jehovah of armies.
And one from the seraphs will fly to me, and in his hand a hot stone, he took with the tongs from off the altar:
And he will touch upon my mouth, and say, Behold, this touched upon thy lips; and took away thine iniquity, and thy sin shall be covered.
And I shall hear the voice of Jehovah, saying, Whom shall I send, and who shall go for us? and behold me saying, Send me.
And he will say, Go, and say to this people, Hearing, hear ye, and ye shall not understand; and seeing, see ye, and ye shall not know.
Make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes, lest they shall see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and their heart shall understand and turn back and be healed to them.
And saying, How long, O Lord? And he will say, Till when the cities were laid waste from not being inhabited, and the houses from not a man, and the land shall be laid waste with desolation.
And Jehovah put man far away, and much forsaking in the midst of the land.
And yet in it a tenth, and it turned back, and it was for consuming, as the terebinth and as the oak which in casting the trunk in them the holy seed its pillar.
And it will be in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Aram came up, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to war against her, and he was not able to fight against her.
And it will be announced to the house of David, saying, Aram rested upon Ephraim; and his heart will move to and fro and the heart of his people, as the woods of the forest moved from the face of the wind.

In that day shall be a highway from Egypt to Assur, and Assur came into Egypt, and Egypt into Assur, and the Egyptians served with Assur.
In that day Israel shall be the third to Egypt and to Assur, and a blessing in the midst of the land:
Whom Jehovah of armies blest him, saying, Blessed my people of Egypt, and the work of my hand, Assur, and my inheritance Israel.
In the year Tartan came to Ashdod, (in Sargon's sending him, king of Assur) and he will fight with Ashdod and take it:
In that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah, son of Amos, saying, Go loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thou shalt draw off the shoe from thy foot And he will do so, going naked and barefoot.
And Jehovah will say, As my servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot three years, a sign and miracle upon Egypt and upon Cush:
Thus shall the king of Assur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the exile of Cush, boys and old men naked and barefoot, and buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.
And they were dismayed and ashamed of Cush their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
And he inhabiting this island said in that day, Behold, thus our expectation, where we fled there for help to be delivered from the face of the king of Assur: and how shall we escape?
The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south for passing through, from the desert it came, from a fearful land.
A hard vision was announced to me: The spoiler spoiled, and he laying waste, laid waste. Go up, O Elam: press, O Media; all her sighing I caused to cease.
For this, my loins were filled with pain: distress took hold of me as the pains of her bringing forth: I was shaken from hearing; I trembled from seeing.
My heart wandered; trembling made me afraid: the evening twilight of my desire he put to me for fear.
Set in order the table; view the watch-tower; eat, drink: arise ye chiefs, anoint the shield.
For thus said Jehovah to me, Go set up a watchman, he shall announce what he shall see.
He will see a chariot, a pair of horse men, the rider of an ass, the rider of a camel; and listening, he listened with much attention.
And he will call, A lion: on the watch-tower my lord, I stand continually in the day, and upon my watch I stand all the night.
And behold, here came a chariot, a man, a pair of horsemen. And he will answer and say, She fell, Babel fell; and the carved images of her god he brake in pieces to the earth.
O my threshing, and the son of my threshing-floor, what I heard from Jehovah of armies the God of Israel, I announced to you.
The burden of Dumah. He called to me from Seir, Watch, what of the night? watch, what of the night?
The watch said, I will mark out morning, and also night; if ye will seek, seek ye: turn back, come.
The burden of Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, ye wayfarers of Dedanim.
To meet the thirsty, bring ye water, O inhabitants of the land of Tema: anticipate ye him wandering, with bread.
For they fled from the face of the swords, the sword drawn out, and from the face of the bent bow, and from the face of the heaviness of war.
For thus said the Lord to me, Within yet a year; as the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar was finished.
And the rest of the bows of the strong sons of Kedar shall be few: for Jehovah God of Israel spake.
The burden of the valley of vision. What to thee now, that thou wentest up all of thee, to the roofs?
The city put in commotion was filled with noise, the exulting city: thy wounded not wounded of the sword, and not the dead of war.
All thy chiefs fled together, they were bound of the bow: all they finding thee were bound together; they fled from from far off.
For this I said, Look ye away from me; I will be bitter in my weeping, ye shall not hasten to comfort me upon the desolation of the daughter of my people.
For a day of consternation, and of treading down, and perplexity by the Lord Jehovah of armies of the valley of vision, of undermining the wall, and of a cry for help to the mountains.
And Elam lifted up the quiver with the chariot of men, horsemen; and Kir made naked the shield.
And it shall be the chosen of thy valleys was filled with chariots, and the horsemen placed a seat at the gate.
And he will uncover the covering of Judah, and thou wilt look in that day to the weapons of the house of the forest.
The clefts of the city of David ye saw, that they were many: and ye shall gather the water of the lowest pool.
The houses of Jerusalem ye numbered, and ye will break down the houses to fortify the wall.
And ye made a gathering place between the two walls for the water of the old pool; and ye looked not to him making it, and ye saw not him forming it from far off.
And the Lord Jehovah of armies in that day will call to weeping and to wailing, and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth:
And behold, gladness and joy, killing cattle and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.
And it was uncovered in the ears of Jehovah of armies, If this iniquity shall be expiated to you till ye shall die, said the Lord Jehovah of armies.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah of armies, Go, come in to this associate to Shebna who is over the house,
What to thee here, and who to thee here, that thou hewedst to thee here a tomb, he hewing from on high his tomb and cutting in a dwelling in a rock to himself?
Behold, Jehovah casting thee down, the casting down of a man, and covering, he covered thee.
Rolling, he will roll thee a roll as a ball into a land broad of hands: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory the dishonor of thy lord's house.
And I thrust thee from thy station, and from thy standing place he will pull thee down.
And it was in that day I called for my servant, for Eliakim, son of Hilkiah:
And I will clothe him with thy tunic, and I will strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will give thy dominion into his hand, and he was for a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
And I gave the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he opened and none shut, and he shut and none opened.
And I fastened him a peg in a faithful place; and he was for a throne of glory to his father's house.
And they hung upon him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the sprouts, all the vessels of smallness, from the vessels of lavers and even to all the vessels of flasks.
In that day, says Jehovah of armies, shall the peg fastened in a faithful place give way, and it was cut down, and it fell; and the lifting up which was upon it was cut off: for Jehovah spake.
The burden of Tyre. Wail, ye ships of Tarshish, for it was laid waste from a house from going in: from the land of Chittim it was uncovered to them.
Be ye silent, O inhabitants of the isle; the merchants of Zidon passing over the sea filled thee.
On many waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river her produce; and she shall be the emporium of nations.
Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea said, the strength of the sea, saying, I was not pained, I brought not forth, and I caused not youths to grow, and I raised not up virgins.
As the hearing to Egypt; they shall be pained as the hearing of Tyre.
Pass ye through Tarshish; wail, ye inhabitants of the isle.
This to you the exulting from the days of old, her beginning; her feet shall fail her sojourning from far off.
Who will counsel this against Tyre, encircled with a crown, whom her merchants, chiefs; her merchants the honored of the earth.
Jehovah of armies purposed it to profane the pride of all glory, to make light all the honored of the earth.
Pass through thy land as a river, thou daughter of Tarshish: no more girding.
He stretched forth his hand over the sea, he disquieted kingdoms: Jehovah commanded to Canaan to destroy her fortress.
And he will say, Thou shalt no more add to exalt, thou violated virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; also there it shall not be rest to thee.
Behold the land of the Chaldees; this people was not; Assur founded it for the inhabitants of the desert: they set up its watch-towers, they raised up its fortresses, he set it for ruins.
Wail, ye ships of Tarshish: your strength was laid waste.
And it was in that day, and Tyre was forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: from the end of seventy years it shall be to Tyre as the song of a harlot.
Take a harp, go about the city, O harlot having been forgotten; be cheerful, playing on the instrument; increase the song so that thou shalt be remembered.
And it was from the end of seventy years, Jehovah will review Tyre, and she turned back to her gift, and she committed fornication with all the kingdoms of the land upon the face of the earth.
And her traffic and her gift holy to Jehovah: it shall not be treasured up, and it shall not be laid up; for to those dwelling before Jehovah her traffic shall be for eating to be satisfied, and for a splendid covering.
Behold, Jehovah emptying the earth and making it waste, and subverting its face, and scattering its inhabitants.
And it was as the people, so the priest; as the servant, so his lord; as the maid, so the mistress; as the buyer, so he selling; as he lending, so the borrower; as be lending on interest, so he exacting interest to him.
Being emptied, the land shall be emptied: and being plundered, it shall be plundered: for Jehovah spake this word.
The earth mourning, fell away: the habitable globe languishing, fell away: the heights of the people of the land languished,
And the earth was polluted under its inhabitants, for they passed by the instructions, they changed the law, they broke the eternal covenant.
For this, the curse consumed the earth, and they dwelling in it, will transgress: for this, they dwelling upon the earth were burned, and those remaining, men of fewness.
The new wine mourned, the vine languished, all they joyful of heart, sighed.
The exulting of the drums ceased, the noise of those triumphing, left off, the exulting of the harp ceased.
They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to those drinking it.
The city of desolation was broken down: every house was shut up from coining in.
An outcry for wine in the streets; all joy grew dark, the exulting of the earth was carried into exile.
Desolation was left in the city, and the gate shall be struck in ruins.
For thus it shall be in the midst of the land in the midst of the peoples, as the beating of the olive, as the gleanings if the vintage was finished.
They shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for joy in the majesty of Jehovah they cried aloud from the sea.
For this, with lights they honored Jehovah in the isles of the sea, the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
From the wing of the earth we heard songs, glory to the just one. And saying, Destruction to me, destruction to me, wo to me! they acting deceitfully, acted deceitfully; and spoiling, they acting deceitfully, acted deceitfully.
Fear, and the pit, and the snare, upon thee, thou inhabiters of the earth.
And it was he fleeing from the voice of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he coming up out of the midst of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from the height were opened, and the foundations of the earth, will tremble.
And being broken, the earth was broken to pieces, and the earth being abolished, it was abolished; the earth being shaken, shook.
The earth moving to and fro, shall move to and fro as the intoxicated, and it was removed as a lodge; and its transgression was heavy upon it and it fell, and it shall not add to rise.
And it was in that day Jehovah shall review upon the army of the height upon the height, and upon the kings of the earth upon the earth.
And they gathered a collection of the bound into the dungeon, and they were shut up into a shutting up, and after many days they shall be reviewed.
And the moon blushed, and the sun was ashamed, for Jehovah of armies reigned in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and was honored before his old men.
O Jehovah, thou my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name, for thou didst a wonder; counsels from far off, stability, faithfulness.
For thou didst set from a city to a heap, a fortified city to ruins: a palace of strangers from a city; it shall not be built forever.
For this shall the strong people honor thee, the city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
For thou wert a fortress to the poor, a fortress to the needy in straits; to him a refuge from the inundation, a shadow from the heat when the wind of the terrible ones as the inundation of the wall.
As the heat in Zion the noise of strangers thou shalt bring down; the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the song of the terrible shall be humbled.
Jehovah of armies will make to all peoples in this mountain a drinking of fatness, a drinking of lees of wine, fatness of marrows, strained lees of wine.
And he will swallow up in this mountain the face of the covering covered over all peoples, and the veil covered over all nations.
He swallowed up death for glory, the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people he will remove from off all the earth, for Jehovah spake.
And it was said in that day, Behold, this our God, we hoped for him, and he will save us: this Jehovah, we hoped for him, we will rejoice and be glad in his salvation.
For the hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain, and Moab was thrust down under him as straw was thrust down in the water of the dunghill.

And the fortress of the height of thy walls shall be brought low; be humbled, be struck to the earth, even to the dust.
In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city to us; he will set salvation the wall and the fortification.
Open ye the gates and the just nation watching truths shall come in.
The mind placed upon thee thou wilt form peace, peace, because he trusted in thee.
Trust ye in Jehovah even to eternity, for in Jah Jehovah is the rock of ages.
For he bows down those dwelling in height; for the city set up on high he will bring it down; he will bring it down even to the earth; he will cause it to touch even to the dust.
The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the humble, the steps of the poor.
The way to the just one is straightness: being upright, thou wilt prepare the departing of the just one.
Also the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we hoped for thee; to thy name and to thy remembrance is the desire of the soul.
My soul desired thee in the night; also my spirit in the midst of me I will seek thee: for when thy judgments to the earth, those dwelling in the habitable globe will learn justice.
Shall the unjust be shown favor? He learnt not justice; in the land of justice he will act perversely, and he will not see the majesty of Jehovah.
O Jehovah, high thy hand, they will not see: they shall see and be ashamed for their jealousy of the people; also the fire of thine enemies shall consume them.
O Jehovah, thou wilt judge peace for us: for also all our works thou didst for us.
O Jehovah our God, lords besides thee had dominion over us; but in thee alone will we make mention of thy name.
The dead shall not live; shades shall not rise; for this, thou reviewedst and thou wilt destroy them, and all remembrance to them shall perish.
Thou didst add to the nation, O Jehovah, thou didst add to the nation thou wert honored: thou didst put far; away all the ends of the earth.
O Jehovah, in straits they looked after thee; they poured out a whispering thy correction to them.
As she conceiving will draw near to bring forth, she will be pained and cry out in her pangs, thus were we from before thee, O Jehovah.
We conceived, we were pained, thus we brought forth wind; we shall not make the earth salvation, the inhabitants of the habitable globe shall not fall.
Thy dead shall live, with my corpse shall they rise. Awake and shout, ye dwelling in dust: for the dew of brightness is thy dew, and the land of the shades shall fall.
Go, my people, enter into thy apartments and shut thy doors about thee: hide thee as a little moment till the wrath shall pass by.
For behold, Jehovah will come forth out of his place to review the iniquity of him dwelling in the earth upon him; and the earth uncovered her bloods, and she will no more cover over her slain.
In that day Jehovah will review with his hard and great and strong sword upon leviathan the serpent fleeing, and upon leviathan the winding serpent; and he killed the dragon which was in the sea.
In that day, A vineyard being red, sing to her.
I Jehovah watched her; for the moments I will water her; lest he will review upon her, night and day I will watch her.
Wrath not to me: who shall distribute to me the sharp point of the thorn in battle? I will rush upon her; I will set her on fire together.

For the fortified city was separated, the habitation being cast out and forsaken as the desert: there shall the calf feed, and there he shall lie down, and there he finished its branches.

And it was in that day Jehovah will beat off from the stream of the river even to the torrent of Egypt, and ye shall be gathered together by one, one, ye sons of Israel.

O to the crown of pride, wo to the hirelings of Ephraim! a flower falling away is the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness of those smitten with wine.
Behold, a strong and active one to Jehovah, as a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, as a storm of vast waters overflowing, let fall to the earth with the hand.
With the feet shall the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, be trodden down.
And the flower falling away was the glory of his beauty which is upon the head of the valley of fatness, as the first-fruits before fruit harvest which he looking at it shall see, in its continuing in his hand he will swallow it up.
In that day shall Jehovah of armies be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people.
And for a spirit of judgment to him sitting upon the judgment, and for strength of them turning back the battle of the storm.
And these also went astray by wine, and by strong drink they erred; the priest and the prophet went astray by strong drink, they were swallowed up from wine, they erred from strong drink, they went astray in seeing, they wavered in judgment.
For all tables were full of vomit, of filth without place.
Whom shall he teach knowledge? whom shall he cause to understand hearing? those weaned from milk and those taken away from the breasts.

For with the stammerings of the lip and with another tongue he will speak to this people.
To whom he said to them, This the rest they caused to the weary to rest; and this the quiet: and they would not hear.
And the word of Jehovah was to them, precept to precept, precept to precept; line to line, line to line; a little there, a little there, so that they shall go and they stumbled backward, and were broken and snared and taken.
For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, ye men of scorn, ruling this people which is in Jerusalem.
Because ye said, We cut out a covenant with death, and with hades we did this; when this overflowing scourge passed through it shall not come to us, for we set falsehood our refuge, and in a lie we hid ourselves.
For this, thus said the Lord. Jehovah, Behold me placing for a foundation in Zion a stone, a stone of trial, a corner precious, a foundation being founded: and he believing shall not hasten.
And I set judgment to the line and justice to the weight: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of falsehood, and the waters shall overflow the covering.
And your covenant with death was obliterated, and your league with hades shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through and ye were for a treading down to it.
When passing through it shall take you: for by morning by morning it shall pass through in the day and in the night: and it was only an agitation to;understand the hearing.

Did he not make level its face and disperse the fennel flower, and he will scatter the cummin, and he set the wheat in order, and designated the barley, and the spilt in his bound?
He will instruct him, according to judgment his God will teach him.
For the fennel flower shall not be beaten with the threshing sledge, and the wheel of a wagon shall not be turned about upon the cummin; for the fennel flower shall be beaten out with the rod and the cummin with the rod.
Bread shall be beaten small; for threshing, he will not forever thresh it; and the wheel of his wagon he put in motion and his horsemen shall not beat it small.
Also this shall come forth from Jehovah of armies, he being wonderful of counsel and great of understanding.
Wo to Ariel, Ariel, the city David encamped in! add ye year upon year; the festivals shall run their circle.

And the vision of all will be to you as the words of the book being sealed, which they shall give to him, to him knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I shall not be able, for it was sealed.
And the book was given to him not knowing writing, saying, Read now, this: and he said, I know not writing.
And Jehovah will say, Because that this people drew near with their month, and honored me with their lips, and their heart was far from me, and their fear towards me shall be taught from the command of men.
For this, behold me adding to be wonderful with this people, dealing wonderfully and being a wonder: and the wisdom of their wise perished, and the understanding of their understanding ones shall be hid.
Wo to those making deep to hide counsel from Jehovah, and their work was in darkness, and they will say, Who saw us? and who knew us?

For the terrible one ceased, the mocker was consumed, and they watching vanity were cut off:

And the heart of the hasty shall understand to know, and the tongue of those stammering shall hasten to speak plain.
Liberal shall no more be called to the foolish, and noble shall not be said to the deceiver.
For the foolish will speak folly, and his heart will do vanity to do profaneness and to speak error to Jehovah, to empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
And the implements of the deceiver are evil: he will meditate counsels to destroy the humble with words of falsehood, and in the needy's speaking judgments.
And the liberal will counsel liberal things, and upon liberal things shall he stand.
Rise up, ye careless women; hear my voice, ye confident daughters; give ear to my word.
Days over a year shall ye being confident, be disturbed; for the vintage being finished, the ingathering shall not come.
Tremble, ye careless be disturbed, ye, confident: strip and be naked, gird upon the loins.
Smiting upon the breasts for the fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.
Upon the land of my people shall come up the thorn of the sharp point; so upon the houses of rejoicing of the exulting city.
For the fortress was left, the multitude of the city was forsaken; the hill and the watch-tower for caves even forever; the rejoicing of the wild asses a pasture of the flocks;
Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the desert be for Carmel, and Carmel be reckoned for a forest.
And judgment dwelling in the desert, and justice shall sit in Carmel.
And the work of justice was peace, and the service of justice, rest and confidence, even to forever.
And my people shall sit in a dwelling of peace, and in habitations of trust and in quiet resting places.
And the hail hailing upon the forest; and the city shall be made low in lowness.
Happy ye sowing upon all waters, sending the foot of the ox and the ass.
Wo to thee oppressing, and thou not oppressed; and spoiling, and they spoiled not upon thee! when thou finishing to oppress, thou shalt be oppressed; when thou ceasing to spoil, they shall spoil upon thee.
O Jehovah, pity us: we hoped for thee: be thou their arm for the mornings, also our salvation in time of straits.
From the voice of the multitude peoples fled; from thy lifting up, nations were scattered.
And your spoil was gathered the gathering of the locust: as the running about of locusts he ran to and fro upon it.
Jehovah was exalted; for he dwells On high: he filled Zion with judgment and justice.
And the stability of thy times, the strength of salvation, was wisdom and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah this his treasure.
Behold the lions of God they cried out without: the messengers of peace shall weep bitterness.
The highways lay waste, the traveler passing by, ceased: he brake the covenant, he despised the cities, he reckoned them not men.
The earth mourning, languished: Lebanon being ashamed, pined away: Sharon was as a sterile region, and Bashan was shaken, and Carmel.
Now will I rise, Jehovah will say; now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.
Ye shall conceive dry grass, ye shall bring forth straw: your spirit of fire shall consume you.
And peoples were the burnings of lime; thorns cut down, in fire shall they be burnt.
Hear, ye afar off, what I did and know, ye drawing near, my strength.
The sinners in Zion trembled; trembling seized the profane. Who to us shall sojourn with devouring fire? who to us with everlasting burning?
He going in justice and speaking uprightness, rejecting in the plunder of oppression; shaking his hands from holding upon a gift, shutting his ear from the hearing of bloods, and binding up his eyes from looking upon evil;
He shall dwell upon heights: the strongholds of rocks his height: his bread was given; his waters sure.
Thine eyes shall perceive the king in his beauty: they shall see the land from far off.
Thy heart shall meditate terror. Where the scribe? where the weigher? where he writing the towers?
Thou shalt not see a firm people, a people of a deep lip above hearing; of a stammering tongue, of no understanding.
Behold Zion the city of our appointment: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet dwelling, the tent shall not remove; its pegs shall not be pulled up forever, and none of its cords shall be broken.
But there the mighty Jehovah to us a place of rivers, rivers broad of hands; a ship with the oar shall not go in it, and a mighty ship shall not pass over it.
For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah our law-giver, Jehovah our king; he will save us.
Thy cords were broken in pieces; they will not well strengthen their mast; they spread not the flag: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame plundered the plunder.
And the inhabitant shall not say, I was sick: to the people dwelling in it, iniquity was lifted up.
Draw near, ye nations, to hear; and ye people, attend: the earth shall hear, and its fulness; the habitable globe, and all its offspring.
For the wrath of Jehovah is upon all nations, And anger upon all their army: he devoted them to destruction, he gave them to slaughter.
And their wounded shall be cast out, and their carcasses the stench shall go up, and the mountains flowed down from their blood.
And all the army of the heavens melted, and the heavens shall roll together as a book, and all their army shall fall away as the leaf falling from the vine, and as a falling from the fig tree.
For my sword was drunk in the heavens: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of destruction for judgment.
The sword of Jehovah was filled with blood, it was made fat from the fat of the blood of lambs and he goats, from the fat of kidneys of rams: for a sacrifice to Jehovah in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
And the buffaloes shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the strong ones; and their land was drunk from blood, and from fat shall their dust be made fat.
For a day of vengeance to Jehovah, a year of retributions for the contention of Zion.
And its torrents turned to pitch, and its dust to sulphur, and its land to burning pitch.
Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall be laid waste; none passing through it forever to forever.
And the pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; the ibis and the raven shall dwell in it: and he stretched out upon it the line of desolation and the stones of emptiness.
Its nobles shall be called to the kingdom, and none there, and all its chiefs shall be no more.
And thorns came up in her palaces, the nettle and the thorn bush in her fortifications, and it was a dwelling of jackals, an enclosure for the daughters of the ostrich.
And animals of the desert lighted upon the howlers, and the he goat shall call to his neighbor; also there the night spectre rested, and found for herself a resting place.
There the arrow-snake nested, and she will lay eggs and hatch, and brood in her shadow: also there the falcons were collected, the female with her companion.
Seek ye from the book of Jehovah, and read: One of these was not wanting; a female her companion they missed not: for my mouth it commanded, and his spirit it collected them.
And be cast the lot for them, and his hand divided it to them by line; they shall possess it even forever, to generation and generation they shall dwell in it.
The desert and the dryness shall be glad for them; and the sterile region shall rejoice and blossom as the meadow flower.
Blossoming, it shall blossom and rejoice, also with joy and shouting: the glory of Lebanon was given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God.
Strengthen the relaxed hands and make firm the feeble knees.
Say to those hasty of heart, Be strong ye shall not fear; behold, your God will come with vengeance, the recompense of God; he will come and save you.
Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened.
Then shall the lame one leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall give forth the voice: for waters brake forth in the desert, and torrents in the sterile region.
And the dry was for a pool, and the thirsty land for fountains of water: in the dwelling of jackals its lying down, an enclosure for the reed and the bulrush
And a highway was there, and a way, and it shall be called to it, A way of holiness; the unclean one shall not pass through it; and it is for them; he going the way, and the foolish shall not err.
The lion shall not be there, and the rapacious beast shall not go up upon it, it shall not be found there; and the redeemed went.
And the ransomed of Jehovah shall turn back and come to Zion with a shout of joy and eternal joy upon their heads: and they shall attain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
And it will be in the fourteenth year to king Hezekiah, Senherib kind of Assur came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and he will seize them.
And the king of Assur will send Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a weighty army. And he will stand by the channel of the higher pool in the highway of the fuller's field.
And Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, will come forth, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah Asaph's son, remembering.
And Rabshakeh will say to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus said the king, the great king of Assur, What this trust in which thou trustedst?
I said, (also a word of the lips) Counsel and strength for the war; now upon whom trustedst thou that thou didst rebel against me?
Behold, thou trustedst upon the staff of this broken reed, upon Egypt; which, shall a man rest upon it, it was into his hand and pierced it: thus Pharaoh king of Egypt to all trusting upon him.
And if thou shalt say to me, We trusted to Jehovah our God: is it not he whom Hezekiah turned away his heights, and his altars, and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, Before this altar shall ye worship?
And now, become surety now, to my lord the king of Assur, and I will give to thee two thousand horses if thou shalt be able to give to thee riders upon them.
And how wilt thou turn back the face of one prefect of the servants of my lord, the smallest of them, aid trust for thee upon Egypt for chariot and for horsemen?
And now came I up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
And Eliakim will say, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak now to thy servants Aramean, for we hear; and thou shalt not speak to us Judaic in the ears of the people who are upon the wall.
And Rabshakeh will say, Did my lord send me to thy lord and to thee to speak these words? did he not to the men sitting upon the wall to eat their excrements and to drink their urine with you?
And Rabshakeh will stand and call with a great voice in Judaic, and say, Hear ye the words of the king, the great king of Assur.
Thus said the king, Hezekiah shall not lift up to you, for he will not be able to deliver you.
And Hezekiah shall not cause you to trust to Jehovah, saying, Delivering, Jehovah will deliver us: this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
Ye shall not hear to Hezekiah; for thus said the king of Assur, Make to me a blessing, and come forth to me: and eat a man of his vine and a man of his fig tree, and drink ye a man water of his cistern;
Till my coming and I took you to a land as your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
Lest Hezekiah shall stimulate you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Did each of the gods of the nations deliver his land from the hand of the king of Assur?
Where the gods of Hamath and Arpad? where the gods of Sepharvaim? and when have they delivered Shomeron from my hand?
Who among all the gods of these lands who delivered their land from my hand, that Jehovah will deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
And they will be silent and not answer him a word: for this the command of the king, saying, Ye shall not answer.
And Eliakim son of Hilkiah who was over the house, will go in, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, remembering, to Hezekiah, their garments rent, and they will announce to him the words of Rabshakeh.
And it will be when king Hezekiah heard, and he will rend his garments, and he will be covered with sackcloth and go in to the house of Jehovah.
And he will send Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the old men of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah, son of Amos, the prophet.
And they will say to him, Thus said Hezekiah, A day of straits and chastisement and reproach, this day; for the sons came even to the breaking forth and not strength to bring forth.
Perhaps Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh whom his lord the king of Assur sent him to reproach the living God, and judge upon the words which Jehovah thy God heard; and lift thou up a prayer for the remnant being found.
And the servants of king Hezekiah will come to Isaiah.
And Isaiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to your lord, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not fear from the face of the words which thou heardest which the boys of the king of Assur reviled me.
Behold me giving a spirit into him and he heard a report, and he turned back to his land; and I caused him to fall by the sword in his land.
And Rabshakeh will turn back and find the king of Assur warring against Libnah: for he heard that he removed from Lachish.
And he heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Cush, saying, He came forth to war with thee. And he will hear, and send messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Thy God in whom thou trustest shall not lift thee up in him, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assur.
Behold, thou heardest what the kings of Assur did to all the lands to destroy them; and shalt thou be delivered?
Did the gods of the nations deliver them which my fathers destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden which were in Thelassar?
Where the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king to the city of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah?
And Hezekiah will take the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it: and he will go up to the house of Jehovah, and Hezekiah will spread it before Jehovah.
And Hezekiah will pray to Jehovah, saying,
Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, dwelling in the cherubim, thou thyself God alone to all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made the heavens and the earth.
Bend, O Jehovah, thine ear, and hear; open, O Jehovah, thine eye, and see; and hear all the words of Senherib which he sent to reproach the living God.
Indeed, O Jehovah, the kings of Assur laid waste all the lands, and their land;
And he gave their gods into fire; for they were not God but the work of man's hands, wood and stone: and they will destroy them.
And now, Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou alone art Jehovah.
And Isaiah son of Amos will send to Hezekiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Because thou didst pray to me against Senherib the king of Assur.
This the word that Jehovah spake concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion despising to thee, deriding to thee; the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head after thee.
Whom didst thou reproach and revile, and against whom didst thou raise up the voice, and wilt thou lift up thine eyes on high to the Holy One of Israel?
By the hand of thy servants thou didst reproach Jehovah, and wilt thou say, By the multitude of my chariots I came up to the height of the mountains, to the thighs of Lebanon; and I will cut down the stature of his cedars, the choicest of his cypresses: and I will go into the height of his extremity, the forest of his Carmel.
I dug and drank water; and I will dry up with the sole of my footstep all the rivers of Egypt,
Didst thou not hear to remoteness I did it? from days of old and I formed it? now did I bring it and thou shalt be to lay waste fortified cities into straits.
And their inhabitants short of hand; they were dismayed and ashamed; they were the greet herb of the field and the verdure, and the tender grass of the enclosure of the roofs, and a blasting before it rose up.
And thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, I knew; and thine anger against me.
Because thine anger against me and thine arrogance came up into mine ear, and I put my hook in thy nose and my curb in thy lips, and I turned thee back in the way which thou camest in it.
And this the sign to thee: To eat this year the self-sown; and in the second year, that growing of itself: and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruits.
And the escaping of the house of Judah being left shall add a root downward and make fruit upward:
For from Jerusalem shall come forth a remnant, and the escaping from mount Zion: the zeal of Jehovah of armies shall do this.
For this, thus said Jehovah concerning the king of Assur, Thou shalt not come into this city, and thou shalt not shoot an arrow there, and thou shalt not go before it with a shield, and thou shalt not cast a mound against it.
In the way which he came in it he shall turn back, and to this city he shall not come in, says Jehovah.
And I covered over this city to Save it for my sake, and for the sake of David my servant.
And the messenger of Jehovah will go forth, and strike in the camp of Assur a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they will rise early in the morning, and behold, all of them dead corpses.
And Senherib king of Assur will remove and go and turn back and dwell in Nineveh.
And it will be he worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat; and Esar-Haddon his son will reign in his stead.
In those days Hezekiah was sick to death. And Isaiah son of Amos, the prophet, will come in to him, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Command to thy house, for thou diest, and shalt not live.
And Hezekiah will turn his face to the wall and pray to Jehovah.
And he will say, O Jehovah, remember now how I went before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and I did the good in thine eyes: And Hezekiah will weep a great weeping.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Isaiah, saying,
Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus said Jehovah, the God of David thy father, I heard thy prayer; and I saw thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.
And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assur: and I covered over this city.
And this to thee the sign from Jehovah that Jehovah will do this word which he spake:
Behold me turning back the shadow of the steps which will go down in the steps of Ahaz in the sun, backward ten steps. And the sun will turn back ten steps in the steps which it will go down.
The writing to Hezekiah king of Judah in his being sick, and he will live from his sickness:
I said in the quiet of my days, I shall go to the gates of hades: I was missed the remainder of my years.
I said, I shall not see Jah Jah, in the land of the living: I shall no more behold man with the inhabitants of the place of rest.
Mine age removed, and was carried away from me as a shepherd's tent: I rolled together as a weaver my life: from the thread he will cut me off: from the day even to the night thou wilt finish me.
I set till the morning, as the lion thus will he break all my bones: from the day even to the night thou wilt finish me.
As the twittering swallow so shall I chirp: I shall murmur as the dove: mine eyes languished for height: O Jehovah, oppression is to me; be surety for me.
What shall I speak? and he said to me, and he did: I shall go slowly all my years upon the bitterness of my soul.
O Jehovah, upon these they shall live, and for all of these the life of my spirit: and thou wilt heal me and cause me to live.
Behold, for peace bitterness, to me bitterness: and thou didst cleave to my soul from the pit of destruction: and thou didst cast all my sin behind my back.
For not hades shall praise thee, death celebrate: they going down to the pit shall not hope for thy truth.
The living; the living, he shall praise thee, as from me this day the father to the sons shall make known for thy truth.
Jehovah to save me; and striking my stringed instruments all the days of our life for the house of Jehovah.
And Isaiah will say, They shall lift up round cakes of figs, and rub over the burning sore, and he shall live.
And Hezekiah will say, What the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
In that time Merodach-Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babel, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah: and he will hear that he was sick, and he will be strengthened.
And Hezekiah rejoiced over them, and he will cause them to see the house of the spices, the silver and the gold and the aromatics, and the good oil, and all the house of his vessels: and all which was found in his treasures, there was not a word which Hezekiah caused them not to see, in his house and in all his dominions.
And Isaiah the prophet will come to king Hezekiah, and say to him, What said these men? and from whence will they come to thee? And Hezekiah will say, From a land far off came they to me, from Babel.
And he will say, What saw they in thy house? and Hezekiah will say, All which is in my house they saw: there was not a word that I caused them not to see in my treasures.
And Isaiah will say to Hezekiah, Hear thou the word of Jehovah of armies:
Behold, the days coming and all which is in thy house and which thy fathers treasured up, even to this day, being lifted up to Babel: there shall not be left a word, said Jehovah.
And from thy sons that shall come forth from thee which thou shalt beget, they shall take; and they were eunuchs in the temple of the king of Babel.
And Hezekiah will say to Isaiah, Good the word of Jehovah which thou spakest And he will say, That there shall be peace and truth in my days.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will your God say.
Speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem, and call to her that her war was filled up, her iniquity was paid off: that she received from the hand of Jehovah double for all her sins.
The voice of him calling in the desert, Prepare ye the way of Jehovah, make straight in the sterile region a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the acclivity was for evenness, and the mountain ranges for a valley:
And the glory of Jehovah was uncovered, and all flesh saw it together: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
The voice said, Call And he said, What shall I call? All flesh grass, and all its goodness as the flower of the field:
The grass was dried up, the flower fell away: for the spirit of Jehovah blew upon it: surely the people grass.
The grass was dried up, the flower fell away: and the word of our God shall stand forever.
Upon the high mountain come up for thee, O Zion: announcing the good news, lift up thy voice with strength, O Jerusalem; announcing the good news, lift up, thou shalt not be afraid; say to the cities, Behold your God!

As a shepherd he will feed his flock: with his arm he will gather the lambs, and will lift up into his bosom, he will lead those coming up.
Who measured the water in his palm, and measured the heavens with a span, and held the dust of the earth in a third, and weighed the mountains in a balance and the bills in scales?
Who measured the spirit of Jehovah? and will a man of his counsel make him to know?
With whom did he consult, and will he cause him to understand and teach him in the path of judgment, and teach him knowledge, and cause him to know the way of understanding?
Behold, the nations as a drop from a bucket; they were reckoned as the fine dust of the scales: behold, he will cast down the isles as small dust.
And Lebanon not enough to burn, and its beasts not enough for a burnt-offering.
All the nations as nothing before him; they were reckoned to him from nothing, and vanity.
And to whom will ye liken God? what likeness will ye compare to him?
The artificer cast the carved image, and the founder will spread it out with gold, and he smelted chains of silver.
And he being poor of oblation will choose wood that will not be rotten; he will seek to him a wise artificer to prepare a carved image that will not shake.
Will ye not know? will ye not hear? was it not announced to you from the beginning? did ye not understand from the foundations of the earth?
He sitting upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants as locusts; he stretching out the heavens as fine cloth, and he will extend them as a tent to dwell in:
He gave princes to nothing; he made the judges of the earth as vanity.
Also they were not planted: also they were not sown: also their stock took not root in the earth: and he also blew upon them and they will be dried up, and the storm will lift them up as straw.
And to whom will ye liken me, and shall I be equal? will say the Holy One.
Lift up your eyes on high, and see who created these, bringing forth their army by number: he will call to all of them by name, from the multitude of their strength; and he is strong of power; a man was not wanting.
For what wilt thou say, O Jacob, and wilt thou speak, O Israel, My way was hid from Jehovah, and my judgment will pass over from my God.
Didst thou not know? heardest thou not the eternal God, Jehovah, creating the extremities of the earth, will not faint, and will not be weary? no searching to his understanding.
He gave power to the faint; and to the not strong he will increase strength.
And the boys shall be faint and weary, and the young men faltering, shall become feeble.
And they waiting for Jehovah shall change power; they shall go up on the wing as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall go and not faint.
Be silent to me, ye islands; and the people shall change strength: they shall draw near; then shall they speak: together we will come near for judgment.
Who raised up justice from the sunrising? he shall call him to his foot; he will give the nations before him; and he will bring down kings: he will give as the dust of his sword, as driven straw, his bow.
He will pursue them, he will pass over in peace; the path he will not come in with his feet.
Who made and did, calling the generations from the beginning? I Jehovah, the first, and with the last; I am he.
The isles saw, and they will be afraid; the extremities of the earth will tremble; they drew near and they will come.
They will help a man his neighbor, and he will say to his brother, Be strong.
And the artificer will strengthen the founder, he making smooth with the hammer, he beating the anvil, saying, It is good for the welding; he will strengthen it with nails; it shall not totter.
And thou, Israel, my servant Jacob whom I chose thee, the seed of Abraham my beloved:
Whom I held thee fast from the extremities of the earth, and I called thee from its sides, and saying to thee, Thou my servant; I chose thee, and I rejected thee not.
Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: thou shalt not look around for help for I thy God will strengthen thee; also I helped thee; also I held thee up with the right hand of my justice.
Behold, all they burning with anger against thee shall be ashamed and disgraced: they shall be as nothing; and the men of thy strife shall be destroyed.
Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them; the man of thy contention, the men of thy war, shall be as nothing and as no more.
For I Jehovah thy God holding thy right hand, saying to thee, Thou shalt not fear; I helped thee.
Thou shalt not fear, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I helped thee, says Jehovah, and thy redeemer the Holy One of Israel.
Behold, I set thee to a new cutting threshing sledge having mouths: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat small, and the hills thou shalt set as chaff.
Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall lift them up, and the storm shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
The poor and the needy seeking water, and none; their tongue failing in thirst, I Jehovah will answer them; the God of Israel, I will not forsake them.
I will open rivers upon naked hills, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will set the desert for a pool of water, and the dry land for goings forth of water.
I will give in the desert the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the tree of oil; I will set in the sterile region the the elm and the box tree together.
So that they shall see and know and attend, and consider together that the hand of Jehovah did this, and the Holy One of Israel created it.
Bring near your cause, Will say Jehovah; draw near your strong defences, will the king of Jacob say:
They shall draw near and announce to us what shall happen: shewed they the former things, what they were, and we will set our heart, and we shall know their latter state; or did we hear things coming?
Announce the things coming hereafter, and we shall know that ye are God: also will ye do good or will ye do evil, and we shall look around for help and see together.
Behold, ye are from nothing, and your work no more: an abomination he will choose in you.
I roused up from the north, and he will come: from the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name: and he shall come upon prefects as clay, and as the potter will tread down the mud.
Who announced from the beginning, and we shall know? and before, and we shall say, He is just; also none announcing; also none hearing; also none heard your words.
The first to Zion, Behold, behold them: and to Jerusalem I will give him announcing good news.
And I shall see, and no man; and from these, and no counselor; and I shall ask them, and they will not turn back a word.
Behold, all of them, nothing; their works are no more: wind and emptiness are their libations.
Behold my servant, I will hold fast in him; my chosen, my soul delighted; I gave my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.
He shall not cry, and be shall not lift up, and he shall not cause his voice to be heard without.
A broken reed he shall not break, and bedimmed flax shall he not quench it: he shall bring forth judgment to truth.
He shall not be weak, and he shall not break, till he shall set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law:
Thus said God Jehovah, creating the heavens and stretching them out; and spreading out the earth and its productions; giving breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those going upon it:
I Jehovah called thee in justice, and I will hold by thy hand, and I will guard thee and give thee for a covenant of the people, for the light of the nations,
To open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth the bound out of prison, those sitting in darkness out of the house of the prison.
I Jehovah, this my name: and my glory I will not give to another, and my praise to carved images.
The first things, behold, they came, and new things I announce: before they shall spring up I will cause you to hear.
Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the extremity of the earth, ye going down to the sea, and its fulness; the isles and their inhabitants.
The desert and its cities shall lift up, the enclosures shall Kedar inhabit: they inhabiting the rock shall shout for joy, from the head of the mountains they shall shout for joy.
They shall set glory to Jehovah, and they shall announce his praise in the islands.
Jehovah as a strong one shall go forth; as a man of war he shall raise up jealousy: he shall shout, also he shall cry aloud; he shall be strong against his enemies.
I was silent of old; I will be still, I will restrain myself: as she bringing forth I will cry out; I will lay waste and snuff up together.
I will lay waste mountains and hills, and I will dry up all their green herbage; and I set the rivers for islands, and I will dry up the pools.
I brought the blind by a way they knew not; and I will cause them to tread in beaten paths they knew not: I will set darkness for light before them, and crooked ways into straightness; these words I did them, and I forsook them not.
They were turned back, they will be ashamed with shame, trusting in the carved image, saying to the molten image, Thou our God.
Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, to see.
Who blind but my servant? and deaf as my messenger I shall send? who blind he being perfect? and blind as the servant of Jehovah?
Seeing many things, and thou wilt not watch; opening the ears, and he will not bear.
Jehovah was pleased for sake of his justice; he will magnify the law and make glorious.
And this people was plundered and spoiled; snaring all of them in holes, and they were hid in houses of prisons: they were for plunder and none delivering; a treading down, and none said, Turn back.
Who among you will give ear to this? and will attend and hear hereafter?
Who gave Jacob for a treading down, and Israel for spoils? did not Jehovah against whom we sinned? and they would not go in his ways and they heard not to his laws.
And be will pour upon him the heat of his anger, and the strength of war: and it will burn him from round about, and he will not know; and it will feed upon him and he will not lay to the heart.
And now, thus said Jehovah creating thee, O Jacob, and forming thee, O Israel, Thou shalt not fear, for I redeemed thee; I called by thy name; thou art to me.
When thou shalt pass through the waters, I with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou shalt go through fire thou shalt not be burnt, and the flame shall not consume thee.
For I Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, saving thee: I gave Egypt expiating thee, Cush and Seba instead of thee.
From that thou wert precious in mine eyes, thou wert honored, and I loved thee: and I will give man instead of thee, and peoples instead of thy soul.
Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the sunrisings, and from the west I will gather thee.
Say to the north, Thou shalt give, and to the south thou shalt not withhold: bring in my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremities of the earth;
All being called by name: and I created him; for my glory I formed him; also I made him.
Bring forth the blind people, and there are eyes; and the deaf, and ears to them.
Gather all nations together, and people shall be collected: who among them shall announce this, and will they cause us to hear former things? shall they give their witnesses, and be justified? and will they hear, and say, Truth?
Ye my witnesses, says Jehovah, and my servants whom I chose: so that ye shall know and trust to me, and understand that I am he: before me was no God formed, and after me shall be none.
I, I, Jehovah, and none saving besides me.
I announced and I saved, and I caused to hear, and no stranger among you: and ye are witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.
Also from the day I am he, and none delivering from my hand: I will do and who shall turn it back?
Thus said Jehovah redeeming you, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I sent to Babel, and brought down the bars all of them, and the Chaldees shouting in their ships.
I Jehovah your Holy One, creating Israel your king.
Thus said Jehovah giving a way in the sea, and a beaten path in the strong waters;
Bringing forth the chariot and the horse, the strength and the might together, they shall fall down, they shall not rise: they went out; they were quenched as tow.
Will ye not remember the former things? will ye not discern the things of old?
Behold me doing a new thing; now it shall spring forth, shall ye not know it? I will also set a way in the desert, rivers in the waste.
The beast of the field shall know me, the sea monster and the daughters of the ostrich: for I gave waters in the desert, rivers in the waste to give drink to my people, my chosen.
This people I formed for myself; they shall recount my praise.
And thou calledst me not, O Jacob; and thou overt weary of me, O Israel.
Thou broughtest not to me the sheep of thy burnt-offering, and thou honoredst me not with thy sacrifices I caused thee not to serve with a gift, and I wearied thee not with frankincense.
Thou broughtest not for me a buying with silver, thou didst not satiate me with the fat of thy sacrifices also thou causedst me to serve with thy sins, thou didst weary me with thine iniquities.
I, I am he wiping away thy transgressions for my sake, and I will not remember thy sins.
Cause me to remember; we will judge together; relate thou so that thou shalt be justified.
Thy first father sinned, thy interpreter transgressed against me.
And will defile the chiefs of the holy place, and will give Jacob to be devoted, and Israel for reproaches.
Hear now, O Jacob and Israel, whom I chose:
Thus said Jehovah making thee, and forming thee from the belly, he will help thee; Thou shalt not be afraid, my servant Jacob, and Jeshurun whom I chose.
For I will pour water upon the thirsty, and flowings upon the dry: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.
And they sprung up in the midst of the enclosure as willows by streams of water.
This shall say, I to Jehovah; and this shall call in the name of Jacob; and this shall write his hand to Jehovah, and he shall address in the name of Israel.
Thus said Jehovah king of Israel, and Jehovah of armies, redeeming him, I the first and I the last; and besides me no God.
And who as I shall call and announce it, and set it in order for me from my placing the people of old? and the things coming and that shall come, they shall announce to them.
Ye shall not tremble, and ye shall not be afraid: did I not from thence cause thee to hear? and I announced, and ye my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? and no rock; I knew not.
They forming a carved image all of them emptiness; and their delights shall not profit, and they are their witnesses; they will not see and they will not know, so that they shall be ashamed.
Who formed a god and a carved molten image, profiting for nothing?
Behold, all his associates shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they from man, they shall be gathered together, all of them; they shall stand, they shall tremble, they shall be ashamed together.
The workman of iron with an axe also worked with coal, and he will cleave it with hammers, and will work with the arm of his strength: also he hungered and no strength: he drank not water and was wearied.
The workman of woods stretched out the line; he will delineate it with an awl, he will do it with chisels, and he will delineate it with a compass, and he will make it according to the image of a man, according to the beauty of man; to dwell in the house.
To cut down for him cedars, and he will take the fir tree and the oak, and he will strengthen for himself among the trees of the forest: he planted an ash and the rain will cause to grow.
And it was for a man to burn: and he will take from them and he will be warmed; also he will kindle, and bake bread; also he will make a god, and he will worship; he made it a carved image, and he will fall down to them.
Half of it he burnt in the fire; upon half of it he will eat flesh; he will roast roast, and he will be satisfied: also he will be warm, and he will say, Aha, I was warm, I saw the light.
And its remainder he made for a god, for his carved image: he will fall down to it, and he will worship and pray to it, and say, Deliver me, for thou my god.
They will not know, and they will not discern: he spread over their eyes from seeing; their heart from considering.
And none will set to his heart; and not knowledge, and not understanding to say, Half of it I burnt in the fire; and also I baked bread upon its coals; I will roast flesh and eat: and its remainder shall I make for an abomination? shall I fall down to a trunk of wood?
He fed upon ashes: a deceived heart turned him away, and he shall not deliver his soul, and he shall not say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I formed thee; a servant to me: thou Israel shalt not forget me.
I wiped away as a cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins: turn back to me for I redeemed thee.
Shout, ye heavens, for Jehovah made: make a loud noise, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into a shout of joy, ye mountains, thou forest and every tree in it, for Jehovah redeemed Jacob, and he will be honored in Israel.
Thus said Jehovah redeeming thee, and forming thee from the belly, I am Jehovah making all; stretching forth the heavens alone; spreading out the earth from myself:
Bringing to naught the signs at vain boasters, and he will make those divining, foolish; turning back the wise backward, and he will frustrate their knowledge.
Setting up the word of his servant, and he will complete the counsel of his messengers; saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be dwelt in; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and will raise up her wastes:
Saying to the depth, Be thou dry, and I will dry up thy rivers.
Saying to Cyrus, My shepherd, and he shall complete all my delight: and saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and the temple shall be founded.
Thus said Jehovah to his Messiah, to Cyrus whom I held by his right hand to bring down nations before him; and I will loosen the loins of kings to open before him the doors; and the gates shall not be shut.
I will go before thee, and I will make straight the circles: I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and I will cut down the bars of iron:
And I gave to thee the treasures of darkness, and the hidden stores of lurking places, so that thou shalt know that I Jehovah calling by, thy name am the God of Israel.
For sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my chosen, and I will call to thee by thy name: and I will address thee, and thou knewest me not.
I am Jehovah, and none yet, no God besides me: I will gird thee and thou knewest me not:
So that they shall know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that none besides me. I am Jehovah, and none yet.
I shall form light and create darkness: making peace and creating evil: I Jehovah doing all these.
Drop, ye heavens, from above, and the clouds shall shake out justice: the earth shall open, and they shall bring forth salvation, and justice shall spring up together; I Jehovah created it.
Wo to him striving with him forming him! the potsherd with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him forming it, What wilt thou make? and thy work, No hands to it?
Wo to him saying to the father, What wilt thou beget? and to the woman, What wilt thou bring forth?
Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his potter, Ask me of things coming concerning the sons, and concerning the work of my hands will ye command me?
I made the earth, and man upon it I created: my hand stretched forth the heavens, and all their army I commanded.
I mused him up in justice, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall send away my captivity, not by price and not by a gift, said Jehovah of armies.
This said Jehovah, The labor of Egypt and the gain of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of measure, shall pass over upon thee, and to thee shall they be: after thee shall they come in fetters: they shall pass over and to thee shall they worship and supplicate to thee, Surely God is in thee, and none yet: no God.
Surely thou art God hiding thyself, the God of Israel, the Saviour.
They were ashamed and also disgraced, all of them: together they went in shame the workmen of images.
Israel was saved in Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed and ye shall not be disgraced even to forever, forever.
For thus said Jehovah creating the heavens, He the God forming the earth, and he made it; he prepared it, be created it not in vain, he formed it to be dwelt in: I Jehovah and none besides.
I spake not in secret in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I Jehovah speak justice, announcing straightnesses.
Assemble ye together and come; draw ye near together, the escaped of the nations: they knew not lifting up the wood of their carved image, and praying to God he will not save.
Announce ye, and bring near; also ye shall take counsel together: who caused this to be heard from of old, from then announcing it? was it not I Jehovah? and no God more beside me; a just God and Saviour; none beside me.
Look to me all ye ends of the earth and be saved, for I am God, and none else.
By myself I sware the word, justice went forth out of my mouth, and shall not turn back, That to me every knee shall bend, every tongue shall swear.
Surely saying, In Jehovah to me justice and strength: even to him shall he come; and all being angry against him shall be ashamed.
In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
Bel bent; Nebo bowed down; their images were for the beast and for the cattle: your gifts were carried; a lifting up to the weary.
They bowed down, they bent together; they were not able to deliver the burden and their soul went into captivity.
Hear to me, ye house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, being carried from the belly, being lifted up from the womb:
find even to old age I am he; and even to grayness I will bear; I made and I will lift up, and I will bear, and I will deliver.
To whom will ye liken me and make equal? and compare me and we shall be like?
Squandering gold out of the bag and they will weigh silver in the balance, they will hire a founder, and he will make it a god: they will fall down, they will also worship.
They will lift him up upon the shoulder, they will carry him, they will set him down in his place and he will stand; from his place he shall not depart: also he will cry out to him and he will not answer; he will not save him from his straits.
Remember this, shew yourselves men: turn back, ye transgressing, upon the heart.
Remember the former things from forever: for I am God and no god besides, and none like me.
Announcing the last part from the beginning, and from of old what was not done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my delight:
Calling a ravenous beast from the sunrising, from a land afar off a man of my counsel: also I spake, also I will bring it; I formed, also I will do it.
Hear to me, ye strong of heart, being far from justice.
I brought near my justice; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay: and I gave salvation in Zion for Israel my beauty.
Come down and sit upon the dust, thou virgin daughter of Babel, sit upon the earth: no throne, thou daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt not be added for them to call thee tender and delicate.
Take the two mill-stones and grind flour, and uncover thy veil; strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, also thy reproach shall be seen: I will take vengeance, I will not make peace with man.
Jehovah of armies redeemed us, his name the Holy One of Israel.
Sit thou silently and go into darkness, thou daughter of the Chaldeans for thou shalt no more be added for them to call thee The mistress of kingdoms.
I was angry against my people; I defiled my inheritances, and I will give them into thine hand, and thou didst not set mercy to them; upon the old thou didst make heavy thy yoke greatly.
And thou wilt say, I shall be mistress forever: till thou didst not set these upon thy heart, thou didst not remember its last part.
And now hear this, thou living delicately, dwelling securely, saying in her heart, I, and none besides me; I shall not sit a widow, and I shall not know bereavement.
And these two shall come to thee suddenly, in one day, bereavement and widowhood: as finished they came upon thee, in the multitude of thy sorceries, and in the great numbers of thy enchantments.
And thou wilt trust in thy wickedness: thou saidst, None saw me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge it caused thee to turn away; and thou wilt say in thy heart, I, and none yet besides me.
And evil came upon thee; thou shalt not know its dawn, and ruin shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to expiate it, and desolation shall suddenly come upon thee; thou shalt not know.
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries in which thou didst labor from thy youth; perhaps thou wilt be able to be of use, perhaps thou wilt cause fear.
Thou wert wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Shall those searching out the heavens, those looking upon the stars, causing to know concerning the months, now stand and save thee from what shall come upon thee?
Behold, they were as straw; the fire burnt them; they shall not deliver their soul from the hand of the flame: not a coal for warming, light to sit before it.
Thus shall they be to thee for whom thou didst labor, thy merchants, from thy youth; they wandered a man to his other side; none saving thee.
Hear this, ye house of Jacob, being called by the name of Israel, and from the water of Judah they came forth swearing by the name of Jehovah, and by the God of Israel they shall bring to remembrance, not in truth and not in justice.
For they were called of the holy city, and rested themselves upon the God of Israel; Jehovah of armies his name.
From then I announced the former things, and they went forth out of my Mouth, and I caused them to be heard; I did suddenly, and they shall come.
From my knowledge that thou wert hard, and thy neck an iron sinew, and thy forehead of brass:
I will announce to thee from then; before it shall come I caused thee to hear, lest thou shalt say, My image did them; and my carved image, and my Molten image commanded them.
Thou heardest, seeing it all; and will ye not announce? I caused thee to hear new things from now, and hidden things, and thou knewest them not.
Now were they created and not from then; and before the day and thou heardest them not; lest thou shalt say, Behold, I knew them.
Also thou heardest not; also thou knewest not; also from then thine ear was not opened: for I knew, acting deceitfully, thou wilt act deceitfully, and it was called to thee transgressing from the womb.
For sake of my name I will delay Mine anger; I will be muzzled towards thee, not cutting thee of.
Behold, I purified thee and not with silver; I chose thee in the furnace of affliction.
For my:sake, for my sake will I do: for how shall it be defiled? and I will not give my glory to another.
Hear to me, O Jacob and Israel, my calling; I am he, I the firsts also I the last.
Also my hand will found the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens: -I call to them, they shall stand together.
Assemble, all ye, and hear; who among them announced these things? Jehovah loved him: he will do his delight upon Babel, and his arm upon the Chaldeans.
I, I spake; also I called him: I brought him, and his way prospered.
Draw ye near to me, hear this; I spake not in secret in the beginning; from the time of its being, there was I: and now the Lord Jehovah sent me, and his spirit.
Thus said Jehovah redeeming thee, the Holy One of Israel: I Jehovah thy God teaching thee to profit, causing thee to tread in a way thou shalt go.
Would thou didst attend to my commands! and thy peace shall be as a river, and thy justice as the billows of the sea.
And thy seed shall be as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels as its bowels; his name shall not be cut off and shall not be destroyed from before me.
Go ye forth from Babel; flee from the Chaldeans; with the voice of shouting, announce ye; cause this to be heard; cause it to go forth, even to the extremity o the earth; say ye, Jehovah redeemed his servant Jacob.
And they thirsted not causing them to go in dry places: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: and he will cleave asunder the rock, and the waters will flow out.
No peace, said Jehovah, to the unjust.
Hear to me, ye islands, and attend ye people from far off; Jehovah called me from the belly; from my mother's bowels he made mention of my name.
And he set my mouth as a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me, and he will set me for a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me.
And he will say to me, Thou my servant, Israel, whom I will be honored in thee.
And I said, I labored in vain, for emptiness; and I finish my strength vainly; surely my judgment is with Jehovah and my work with my God.
And now, said Jehovah, forming me from the belly for servant to him to turn back Jacob to him, And Israel shall not be gathered, and I shall be honored in the eyes of Jehovah, and God was my strength.
And he will say, It was light thou being to me a servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to turn back the preserved of Israel: and I gave thee for a light of the nations to be my salvation even to the extremity of the earth.
Thus said Jehovah redeeming Israel, his Holy One, to the despised of soul, to him being abhorred of the nations, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and princes arose, and they shall worship him for sake of Jehovah who was faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.
Thus said Jehovah, In a time of acceptance I answered thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee: and I will guard thee, and I will give thee for a covenant of the people to cause the earth to stand, to cause to inherit the inheritance of desolations,
To say to the bound, Go forth; to those in darkness, Uncover yourselves. They shall feed upon the ways, and in all naked hills their pastures.
They shall not hunger and they shall not thirst, and the heat shall not strike them, and the sun: for he pitying them shall lead them, and to fountains of water he shall conduct them.
And I set all the mountains for a way, and the highways shall be raised up.
Behold, these shall come from far off; and behold, these from the north, and from the sea; and these from the land of Sinim.
Shout, ye heavens, and rejoice thou earth; and the mountains shall break forth with shouting: for Jehovah comforted his people and he will pity his afflicted.
And Zion will say, Jehovah forsook me, and the Lord forgot me.
Shall a woman forget her child, from pitying the son of her womb? also these shall forget, and I shall not forget thee.
Behold, upon the palms I engraved thee; thy walls before me continually.
Thy sons hastened; they destroying thee and laying thee waste shall come forth from thee.
Lift up round about thine eyes and see: they all gathered themselves together, they came to thee. I live, says Jehovah, thou shalt put them all on as an ornament, and thou shalt bind them as a bride.
For thy wastes and thy desolations, and the land of thy destruction, for now it shall press for the inhabitants, and they swallowing thee up were far away.
Yet shall the sons of thy bereavement say in thine ears, The place is strait to me: draw near to me and I shall dwell.
And thou saidst in thy heart, Who begat these to me, and I being bereaved and barren, an exile, and departing? and who caused these to grow? Behold, I was left alone; they, where were they?
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and to the peoples I will raise up my signal: and they brought thy sons in the bosom, and thy daughters shall be lifted up upon the shoulder.
And kings were thy supporters, and princesses thy nurses: their faces to the earth they shall worship to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up; and thou knewest that I Jehovah, that they shall not be ashamed waiting for me.
Shall the prey be taken from the strong? and if the captivity of the just shalt be delivered?
For thus said Jehovah, Also the captivity of the strong shall be taken, and the prey of the terrible shall escape: and I will contend with him contending with thee, and thy sons I will save.
And I will cause those oppressing thee to eat their own flesh, and they shall drink their blood to the full as new wine: and all flesh shall know that I am Jehovah saving thee, and redeeming thee, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Thus said Jehovah, Where this writing of cutting off of your mother which I sent her away? or which of my creditors whom I sold you to him? Behold, in your iniquities ye sold yourselves, and in your transgressions your mother was sent away.
Wherefore, I came, and no man? I called and none answered. Being short, was my hand shortened from redeeming? and if not power in me to deliver behold, in my rebuke I will dry up the sea; I will set the rivers a desert: their fish shall stink from no water, and they shall die with thirst.
I will put darkness upon the heavens, and I will put sackcloth their covering.
The Lord Jehovah gave to me the tongue of the expert to know to help the weary with a word: he will rouse up in the morning by morning, he will rouse up to me the ear to hear as the expert.
The Lord Jehovah opened to me the ear and I opposed not, and I drew not back.
My back I gave to those smiting, and my cheeks to those tearing out the hair: and my face I hid not from shame and spittle.
And the Lord Jehovah will help to me: for this I was not ashamed; for this I set my face as the flint, and I shall know that I shall not be ashamed.
He drawing near justifying me: who shall contend with me? we will stand together: who the lord of my judgment? he shall draw near to me.
Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help for me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall decay as a garment; the moth shall eat them.
Who among you fearing Jehovah, hearing to the voice of his servant? who goes in darkness and no light to him? he shall trust in the name of Jehovah and rest upon his God.
Behold, all ye kindling a fire, girding yourselves with fiery darts: go ye in the light of your fire, and in the fiery darts ye kindled. From my hand was this to you; ye shall lie down for sorrow.
Hear to me, ye pursuing justice, seeking Jehovah: look to the rock ye hewed, and at the quarry of the pit ye dug out.
Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah bringing you forth: for one I called him, and I will bless him, and I will increase him.
For Jehovah comforted Zion: he comforted all her wastes, and he will set her desert as Eden, and her sterile region as the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found in her confession, and the voice of song.
Attend to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will cause my judgment to rest for the light of the peoples.
My justice is near; my salvation went forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me, and to mine arm shall they hope.
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look to the earth from beneath: for the heavens as smoke vanished away, and the earth as a garment shall decay, and they inhabiting as thus shall die; and my salvation shall be forever, and my justice shall not be broken.
Hear to me, ye knowing justice, the people my law in their heart; ye shall not fear the reproach of men; and from their reviling ye shall not be dismayed.
For the moth shall eat them as a garment, and as wool shall the moth eat them: and my justice shall be forever, and my salvation to generation of generations.
Rouse up, rouse up, put on strength, thou arm of Jehovah; rouse up as the days of old, of everlasting generations. Was it not with him cutting off Rahab, wounding the sea monster?
Was it not with him desolating the sea, the water of the great deep? setting the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
And the redeemed of Jehovah shall turn back, and they came to Zion with shouting and eternal joy upon their head: and gladness and joy shall they attain; sorrow and sighing fled.
I, I am he comforting you: who thou? and shalt thou be afraid of man he shall die, and of the son of man shall be given for grass?
And shalt thou forget Jehovah making thee, stretching out the heavens and founding the earth? and thou wilt tremble continually all the day from the face of the anger of him pressing as being prepared to destroy: and where the wrath of him pressing?
He being bowed down hastened to be loosed, and he will not die in the pit, and his bread shall not fail.
And I am Jehovah thy God causing the sea to tremble. And its billows shall be put in motion: Jehovah of armies his name.
And I will put my word in thy mouth, and in the shadow of my hand I covered thee, to plant the heavens and to found the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou my people.
Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, who drank from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou didst drink the goblet cup of reeling, pressing out.
None providing for her of all the sons she brought forth; and none holding by her hand of all the sons she caused to grow.
These two encountering thee; who shall be moved for thee? desolation and breaking, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?
Thy sons fainted; they lay down upon the head of all the streets as an antelope in a net: being full of the wrath of Jehovah the rebuke of thy God.
For this, bear now this, thou afflicted and drunken, and not from wine:
Thus said thy Lord Jehovah and thy God, he will contend for his people, Behold, I took from thy hand the cup of reeling, the goblet cup of my wrath; thou shalt not add to drink it more.
And I put it in the hand of those afflicting thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, and we will pass over; thou wilt set thy middle as the earth, and as the street to those passing over.
Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy glory, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for the uncircumcised shall no more add to come into thee, and the unclean.
Shake thyself from dust: arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bonds of thy neck, thou captive daughter of Zion.
For thus said Jehovah, Ye sold yourselves gratuitously, and ye shall not be redeemed with silver.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, My people at first went down to Egypt to sojourn there, and Assur oppressed them for nothing.
And now what to me here, says Jehovah, that my people were taken gratuitously? ruling, they will cause to give a sharp sound, says Jehovah; and continually all the day my name being despised.
For this, my people shall know my name: for this in that day, for I am he speaking: behold me.
How exalted upon the mountains the feet of him announcing good news, causing peace to be beard: announcing good news of good, causing salvation to be heard; saying to Zion, Thy God reigns!
They watching thee lifted up the voice; the voice together they will shout: for they shall see eye to eye in Jehovah's turning back Zion.
Break forth into joy, shout together, ye wastes of Jerusalem, for Jehovah comforted his people, he redeemed Jerusalem.
Jehovah uncovered his holy arm to the eyes of all nations, and all the ends of the earth saw the salvation of our God.
Turn aside, turn aside, come ye forth from thence; ye shall not touch the unclean thing; come forth from the midst of her; be separated ye lifting up the vessels of Jehovah.
For ye shall not come forth with haste, and in flight ye shall not go; for Jehovah goes before you, and he gathering you the God of Israel.
Behold, my servant shall be wise, he shall be exalted, and lifted up, and be high exceedingly.
As many were astonished at thee, his appearance being so spoiled from man, and his form from the sons of men.
So shall he cause many nations to rejoice for him; kings shall shut their mouth; for what was not recounted to them they saw; and what they heard not, they considered.
Who believed in our report? and to whom was the arm of Jehovah uncovered?
He shall come up as a sucking child before him, and as a root out of a land of dryness: no form to him and no decoration; and we shall see him, and no appearance and we shall desire him.
He was despised and forsaken of men; a man of griefs and knowing affliction: and as hiding the faces from him; he was despised and we regarded him not.
Surely he lifted up our afflictions, and our griefs he carried them: and we reckoned him to be smitten, struck of God, and afflicted.
And he being wounded for our transgressions, and crushed from our iniquities; the correction of our peace upon him, and in the marks of his stripes it was healed to us.
All we as sheep went astray; we turned a man to his way; and Jehovah caused the iniquity of us all to fall upon him.
He was pressed, and he was afflicted, and he will not open his mouth: he was brought as a sheep for the slaughter, and as a sheep before his shearers being dumb and he will not open his mouth.
From constraint and from judgment was he taken, and his generation who shall comprehend? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he struck for them.
And he will give with the unjust his grave, and with the rich in his deaths, for he did no violence, and no deceit in his mouth.
And Jehovah inclined to crash him; piercing him when his soul shall be set a sacrifice for sin, he shall see seed, he shall prolong the days, and the delight of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.
And be shall see of the labor of his soul, he shall be satisfied: by his knowledge my just servant shall justify for many; and he shall bear their iniquities.
For this I will divide to him with many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; for which his soul was poured out to death, and he was numbered with transgressors; and he lifted up the sin of many, and he will supplicate for transgressors.
Shout, thou barren, not bringing forth; break forth in shouting, cry aloud, not being pained; for more the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married, said Jehovah.
Enlarge the place of thy tent, stretch forth the hangings of thy dwellings; thou shalt not spare; lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy pegs.
For the right and the left thou shalt break forth, and thy seed shall inherit the nations, and they shall cause desolated cities to be inhabited.
Thou shalt not fear; for thou shalt not be ashamed: and thou shalt not be disgraced, and thou shalt not be put to shame, for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and thou shalt no more remember the reproach of thy widowhood.
For thy Lord making thee; Jehovah of armies his name; and he redeeming thee, the Holy One of Israel; the God of the earth shall he be called.
As a wife forsaken and grieved of spirit Jehovah called thee, and a wife of youth; for thou shalt be rejected, said thy God.
In a little moment I forsook thee; and with great mercies I will gather thee.
In the outpouring of anger I hid a moment my face from thee; and in eternal mercy I compassionated thee, said Jehovah redeeming thee.
For this the water of Noah to me: as I sware to the water of Noah from again passing over the earth; thus I sware from being angry against thee and from rebuking upon thee.
For the mountains shall remove and the hills shall waver; and my mercy shall not remove from thee, and the covenant of my peace shall not waver, said Jehovah compassionating thee.
Thou afflicted, tossed about, not comforted behold me laying thy stones with paint, and I founded thee with sapphires.
And I set thy battlements the ruby, and thy gates in stones of sparkling, and all thy bound in stones of delight.
And all thy sons taught of Jehovah; and much the peace of thy sons.
In justice shalt thou be prepared: go far off from violence; for thou shalt not be afraid: and from terror, for it shall not draw near to thee.
Behold, gathering, it shall gather together, not from me: who sojourned with thee shall fall for thee.
Behold, I created the workman blowing the coals in the fire, and bringing forth a utensil for his work; and I created the destroyer to overthrow.
Every vessel formed against thee shall not prosper: and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their justice is from me, says Jehovah.
Ho, every one thirsting, Come ye to the waters, and whom there is not to him silver, come ye, buy and eat; and come ye, and buy without silver and without price, wine and milk.
Wherefore will ye weigh silver without bread? and your labour not for fulness? hearing, hear ye to me, and eat good, and your soul shall delight in fatness.
Incline your ear, and come to me, and hear, and your soul shall live; and I will cut out with you an eternal covenant, the sure mercies of David.
Behold, I gave him a witness of the nations, a leader and commanding the nations.
Behold, nations thou shalt not know; thou shalt call, and nations that knew thee not shall run to thee, for sake of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he honored thee.
Seek ye Jehovah in his being found, and call him in his being near.
The unjust one shall forsake his way, and the man of vanity his purposes, and turn back to Jehovah, and he will pity him, and to our God, for he will multiply to forgive.
For not my purposes your purposes and not your ways my ways, says Jehovah.
As the heavens were high above the earth, so my ways were high above your ways, and my purposes above your purposes.
For as the rain coming down and the snow from the heavens, and shall not turn back there, but watering the earth and causing it to bring forth and sprout, and giving seed to be sown, and bread to be eaten;
So shall be my word which went forth out of my mouth: it shall not turn back to me empty, but doing what I delighted in, and it shall prosper for what I send it.
For with joy shall ye go forth, and in peace shall ye be led forth; the mountains and hills shall break forth before you into shouting, and all the trees of the field shall clap the hand.
Instead of the thorn-hedge shall come up the cypress; of the briar shall come up the myrtle: and it was to Jehovah for a name for an eternal sigh; it shall not be cut off.
Thus said Jehovah, Watch ye judgment and do justice; for my salvation drew near to come, and my justice to be uncovered.
Happy the man that shall do this, and the son of man that shall lay hold upon it; watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and watching his hand from doing all evil.
And the son of the stranger joining himself to Jehovah, shall not say, saying, Jehovah separating, will separate me from his people; and the eunuch shall not say, Behold me a dry tree.
For thus said Jehovah to the eunuchs who shall watch my Sabbaths, and choose in what I delighted, and taking hold upon my covenant;
And I gave to them in my house and in my walls a hand and a name good above sons and above daughters: an eternal name will I give to him which shall not be cut off.
And the sons of the stranger joining themselves to Jehovah to serve him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be to him for servants, every one watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and taking hold upon my covenant;
And I brought them to my holy mountain, and I made them rejoice in the house of my prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices for acceptance upon mine altar; for my house shall be called the house of prayer for all the peoples.
Says the Lord Jehovah gathering the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather to him to his gathered.
All ye beasts of the fields, come ye to eat; all ye beasts in the forest.
Look about, ye blind; they all knew not, they all dumb dogs, they shall not be able to bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
And dogs hard of soul, they knew not fulness; and they are evil, they know not understanding; they all looked to their way, a man to his plunder from his extremity.
Come ye, I will take wine, and we will drink strong drink to excess; and the morrow being as this day, the remainder great exceedingly.
The just one perished and none put upon the heart: men of kindness being taken away, for none understanding that the just one was taken away from the face of evil.
He shall come into peace: they shall rest upon their beds, he went in his justice.
And ye, come ye near here, sons of her practicing magic, seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
Against whom will ye deride? against whom will ye make broad the mouth, will ye thrust out the tongue? are ye not children of transgressing and a seed of falsehood?
Being comforted with gods under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?
In the smoothnesses of the torrent they thy portion, they thy lot; also to them thou didst pour out a libation, thou didst bring up a gift Shall I be comforted with these?
Upon a mountain high and lifted up thou didst set thy bed: also there thou wentest up to sacrifice a sacrifice.
Behind the doors and the door-post thou didst set thy memorial: for from me thou didst migrate, and thou wilt go up; thou didst make broad thy bed, and thou wilt cut out to thee from them; thou didst love their bed; thou didst look upon the hand.
And thou wilt pour out for the king with oil and thou wilt increase thy perfumes, and thou wilt send thy messengers even from far off, and thou wilt be made low, even to hades.
In the abundance of thy way thou wert wearied; thou midst, Not to give over; thou didst find the living of thy hand; for this, thou wert not pained.
And whom didst thou fear? and wilt thou be afraid? for thou wilt lie, and thou didst not remember me; thou didst not put it upon thy heart; was not I being silent and from of old, and thou wilt not be afraid of me?
I will announce thy justice and thy works, and they shall not profit thee.
In thy crying out, shall thy gatherings deliver thee? and the wind shall lift them all up; a breath shall take: and he taking refuge in me shall inherit the land, and he shall inherit my holy mountain;
And he shall say, Lift ye up, lift ye up; clear the way, take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people.
For thus said the high and lifted up inhabiting eternity, and his name Holy; being lifted up, and I will dwell in the holy place, and with the broken and humble of spirit, to preserve alive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the broken.
For not forever will I contend, and not to everlasting will I be angry: for the spirit will faint from before me, and the lives I made.
For the iniquity of his plunder was I angry, and I will smite him: covering myself, and I will be angry, and he went turning away in the way of his heart.
I saw his ways, and I will heal him: and I will lead him and I will restore comforts to him, and to his mourners.
Creating the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him being far off, and to him being near, said Jehovah; and I healed him.
And the unjust as the tossed sea when it shall not be able to rest, and its waters will toss up mud and mire;
no peace, said God, to the unjust.
Call with the throat; thou shalt not spare; as a trumpet lift up thy voice, and announce to my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sin.
And day, day, they will seek me, and delight to know my way as a nation who did justice and forsook not the judgment of his God: they will ask me the judgments of justice, they will delight to draw near to Gad.
For what did we fast, and thou sawest not? we humbled our soul and thou wilt not know? Behold, in the day of your fasting ye will find desire, and ye will exact all your labors.
Behold, for contention and strife ye will fast, and to strike with the fist of injustice: ye shall not fast as today to cause your voice to be heard on high.
Will this be the fast I shall choose? a day for a man to humble his soul? to bend his head as a bulrush, and he will place sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fast and a day of acceptance to Jehovah.
Is not this the fast I shall choose? to loose the bands of injustice, to shake off the bundles of the yoke, and to send away the broken free, and ye shall break every yoke?
Is it not to break thy bread to the hungry, and thou shalt bring the wandering poor to thy house? when thou shalt see the naked and cover him; and thou shalt not hide from thy flesh.
Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn, and thy healing shall spring forth quickly: and thy justice going before thee; the glory of Jehovah shall gather thee.
Then shalt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt cry for help, and he will say, Behold me. If thou shalt take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the extending of the finger, and the word of vanity;
And thou shalt give out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the humble soul; and thy light rising in darkness, and thy thick darkness as the noon.
And Jehovah led thee continually, and he satisfied thy soul in dry places, and he will make thy bones strong: and thou wert as a watered garden, and as a spring of water which its waters shall not deceive.
And from thee the old wastes were built; the foundations of generation and generation thou shalt raise them up, and it was called to thee, Walling the breach, Turning back the beaten paths to dwell in.
If thou shalt turn back thy foot from the Sabbath, doing thy delight in my holy day; and thou calledst to the Sabbath a delight for the holy of Jehovah, being honored; and thou honoredst him from doing thy ways, from finding thy delight, and speaking the word.
Then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah, and I caused thee to ride upon the heights of the earth, and I caused thee to eat the inheritance of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.
Behold, the hand of Jehovah was not shortened from saving, and his ear heavy from hearing:
But your iniquities were separating between you and between your God, and your sins caused to hide the face from you from hearing.
For your hands were polluted with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips spake falsehood, your tongue will mutter evil.
None called upon justice, and none judged in truth: trusting in vanity and speaking evil, they conceived labor and brought forth vanity.
They plundered vipers eggs, and they will weave spiders webs: he eating from their eggs shall die, and being crushed, it shall break forth a viper.
Their webs shall not be for a garment, and they shall not be covered with their works: their works the works of vanity, and the work of violence in their hands.
Their feet will run to evil, and they will hasten to pour out innocent blood: their purposes, purposes of vanity; destruction and breaking in their highways.
The way of peace they knew not, and no judgment in their paths: they perverted their beaten paths for themselves: every one treading in it shall not know peace.
For this judgment was far off from us, and justice shall not overtake us: we shall wait for light, and behold, darkness; for brightness, and we shall walk in thick darkness.
We shall feel for the wall as the blind, and we shall feel, as no eyes: we stumbled at noon as at evening twilight; in fertile fields as the dead.
We shall growl as bears all of us, and murmuring we shall murmur as doves: we shall wait for judgment, and none; for salvation, it was far from us.
For our transgressions were multiplied before thee, and our sins answered against us: for our transgressions are with us, and our iniquities we knew them.
Transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing from after our God, speaking violence and apostasy, they conceived and muttered from the heart words of falsehood.
And judgment was turned away behind, and justice shall stand from far off: for truth fainted in the street, and right will not be able to come in.
And truth shall be lacking; and he departing from evil being plundered: and Jehovah will see, and it will be evil in his eyes, for no judgment.
And he will see that not a man, and he will be astonished that none was supplicating: and his arm will save for him, and his justice it upheld him.
And he will put on justice as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and be will put on robes of vengeance a garment, and he will clothe himself with zeal as an upper garment.
According to the works, accordingly he will recompense, wrath to his adversaries, recompense, to his enemies; to the islands will he requite recompense.
And from the west they shall fear the name of Jehovah, and from the rising of the sun, his glory. When the adversary shall come in as a river, the spirit of Jehovah was lifted up against him.
And be redeeming came to Zion, and they turning away transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.
And I, this my covenant with them, said Jehovah: my spirit which is upon thee, and my word which I put in thy mouth shall not depart from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy seed, from the mouth of thy seed's seed, said Jehovah, from now and even forever.
Arise, shine, for thy light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon thee.
For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gloom the nations: and Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
And nations shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.
Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: they all gathered together, they came to thee: thy sons shall come from far off, and thy daughters shall be supported upon the side.
Then thou shalt see and flow together, and thy heart shall fear and be enlarged; for the multitude of the sea shall turn to thee, the strength of the nations shall come to thee.
An abundance of camels shall cover thee, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all they from Seba shall come: they shall lift up gold and frankincense; they shall announce good news, the praises of Jehovah.
All the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered together to thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall serve thee: they shall go up for acceptance to mine altar and I will adorn the house of my glory.
Who are these? they will fly as a cloud, and as doves to their lattices.
For the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish among the first to bring thy sons from far off, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he honored thee.
And the sons of the stranger built thy walls, and their kings shall serve thee: for in my wrath I struck thee, and in mine acceptance I compassionated thee.
And thy gates were opened continually; day and night they shall not be shut; to bring to thee the strength of the nations, and their kings being led on.
For the nation and the kingdom which will not serve thee shall perish; and the nations shall be laid waste with the sword.
The glory of Lebanon shall come to thee, the cypress, the plane tree, and the box tree together, to adorn my holy place; and I will honor the place of my foot.
And sons humbling thee came bowing down to thee: and all they despising thee worshiped at the soles of thy feet; and they called thee, The city of Jehovah, Zion, the Holy One of Israel.
Because of thy being forsaken and hated, and none passed through, and I set thee for a perpetual excellency, the joy of generation and generation.
And thou didst suck the milk of nations, and thou shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou knewest that I am Jehovah, saving thee and redeeming thee, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Instead of brass I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver, and instead of woods, brass, and instead of stones, iron: and I set thine overseers peace, and thy rulers justice.
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation and breaking in thy bounds: and thou calledst thy walls Salvation, and thy gates, Praise.
The sun shall be no more to thee for light by day, and for brightness the moon shall not shine to thee: and Jehovah was to thee for an eternal light, and thy God for thy glory.
Thy sun shall no more go down, and thy moon shall not withdraw, for Jehovah shall be to thee for an eternal light, and the days of thy mourning were finished.
And thy people all of them just: forever shall they inherit the land, watching his planting, the work of my hand for glory.
The little one shall be for a thousand, and the small for a strong nation: I Jehovah will hasten it in its time.
The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah anointed me to announce good news to the afflicted, he sent me to bind up to the broken of heart, to call freedom to the captives, and the opening of the prison to the bound.
To call the year of acceptance to Jehovah, and the day of vengeance to our God; to comfort all those mourning;
To set to those mourning in Zion, to give to them adorning instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the vestment of praise for the spirit of faintness; and it shall be called to them, The mighty trees of justice of the planting of Jehovah, to be honored.
And they shall build the perpetual wastes; they shall raise up the former desolations, and they renewed the cities of the waste, the desolations of generation and generation.
And strangers stood and fed your sheep, and the sons of the stranger, your husbandmen and your vinedressers.
And ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, serving our God; he shall say to you, Ye shall eat the strength of the nations, and ye shall take place in their honor.
For your shame the second place; and they shall rejoice in reproach, their portion: for this in their land they shall inherit the second place; eternal joy shall be to them.
For I Jehovah love judgment, hating robbery for burnt-offering; and I gave their works in truth, and I will cut out to them an eternal covenant.
And their seed was known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples: all seeing them shall recognise them, for they the seed Jehovah blessed.
Rejoicing, I will rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall exult in my God, for he put upon me the garments of salvation, and he clothed me with a robe of justice, as a bridegroom will be a priest with a turban, and as a bride will be adorned with her dress.
For as the earth will bring forth her sprout, and as a garden will cause the things sown to sprout, so the Lord Jehovah will cause justice and praise to sprout before all nations.
For sake of Zion I will not be silent, and for sake of Jerusalem I will not rest till its justice shall go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a flame shall burn.
And the nations shall see thy justice, and all kings thy glory: and a new name shall be called to thee which the mouth of Jehovah shall name it.
And thou wert a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a tiara of royalty in the hand of thy God.
It shall no more be said to thee, Forsaken; and to thy land it shall no more be said, Desolation; for it shall be called to thee, My delight in her, and to thy land, Married: for Jehovah delighted in thee, and thy land shall be married.
As a young man will marry a virgin, thy sons shall marry thee: and the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, thy God will rejoice over thee.
I appointed those watching over thy walls, O Jerusalem: all the day and all the night continually they shall not be silent: ye remembering Jehovah, no stillness to you.

Jehovah sware by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, If I shall give more thy grain for food to thine enemies, and if the sons of the stranger shall drink thy new wine which thou didst labor for it:
For they gathering it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they collecting it shall drink it in the enclosures of my holy place.
Pass through, pass through in the gates; clear ye the way of the people; lift up, lift up the highway; free it from stone; raise up a signal for the peoples.
Behold, Jehovah caused to be heard to the extremity of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation coming: behold, his reward with him, and his work before his face.
And they called to them, The holy people, redeemed of Jehovah: and it shall be called to thee, A city sought for: not forsaken.
Who this coming from Edom, splendid with garments from Bozra? this adorned in his attire, bowing himself in his strength? I, speaking in justice, great for salvation.
Wherefore red to thine attire, and thy garments as he treading in the wine press?
I trod the wine-press alone; and from the people not a man with me: and I will tread them down in my wrath, and I will trample them in mine anger, and their juice shall be sprinkled upon my garment, and I will stain all my vestment.
For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redemption came.
And I shall look, and none helping; and I shall be astonished and none upholding: and my arm will save for me, and my wrath it upheld me.
And I will tread down peoples in mine anger; and I will make them drunk in my wrath, and I will bring down their juice to the earth.
I will remember the mercies of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah according to all that Jehovah benefited us, and the abundance of good to the house of Israel which he benefited them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his kindnesses.
And he will say, Surely they my people, sons that will not lie: and he will be to them for Saviour.
In all their straits not an adversary, and: a messenger of his face saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he will take them up and bear them all the days forever.
They embittered and grieved his holy spirit; and he will turn to them for an enemy; he fought against them.
And he will remember the days of old, Moses his people; Where he bringing them up from the sea with the shepherd of his sheep? where he putting his holy spirit in the midst of him?
Leading by the right hand of Moses, the arm of his glory dividing the waters from before them to make to him an eternal name.
Leading them through the depths as a horse in the desert, they shall not be weak.
As cattle in the valley the spirit of Jehovah will come down, it will cause us to rest: so thou didst lead thy people, to make to thee a name of glory.
Look from the heavens, and see from thy holy dwelling and thy glory: where thy zeal and thy strength? the multitude of thy bowels and thy compassions to me restrained themselves.
For thou our Father, for Abraham knew us not, and Israel will not recognize us: thou Jehovah our Father redeeming us; thy name from eternity.
Wherefore, O Jehovah, wilt thou cause us to wander from thy ways, wilt thou harden our heart from thy fear? turn back for sake of thy servants, the tribes of thine inheritance.
For a little While the people of thy holy place possessed it: our adversaries trod down thy holy place.
We were from of old: thou didst not rule with them; thy name was not called upon them.
Would that thou didst rend the heavens; thou camest down; the mountains flowed from before thee.
As the fire of meltings was kindled the fire will cause the water to boil, to cause thy name to be known to thine adversaries; from thy face shall the nations be moved.
In thy doing wonderful things we shall not expect, thou camest down, the mountains flowed from before thee.
From forever they heard not, they gave not ear, the eye saw not, O God, besides thee, he will do to him waiting for him.
Thou mettest him rejoicing and doing justice, they shall remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wert angry; and we shall sin in them of old, and we shall be saved.
And we were all as the unclean, and all our justice as the garment of monthly courses; and we shall all fail away as the leaf; and our iniquities as the wind will take us away.
And none calling upon thy name, none rousing himself to take hold upon thee: for thou hiddest thy face from us, and thou wilt melt us by the hand of our iniquities.
And now, O Jehovah, thou our Father; we the clay and thou forming us; and we all the work of thy hand.
Thou wilt not be angry, O Jehovah, even greatly, and not forever wilt thou remember iniquity: behold, look now, Ye are all thy people.
The cities of thy holy place were desert; Zion was a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.
The house of our holy place and our glory where our fathers praised thee, was for a burning of fire, and all our precious things were for desolation.
For these wilt thou refrain thyself, O Jehovah? wilt thou be silent, and wilt thou humble us even greatly?
I was sought by them they asked not; I was found by them not seeking me: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation not calling upon my name.
I spread forth my hands all the day to a perverse people, going the way not good, after their purposes.
The people irritating me to my face continually; sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;
Dwelling among the graves, and they will lodge among the watchers, eating swine's flesh, and broth of unclean things in their vessels.
Saying, Come near to thyself; thou shalt not touch upon me, for I was clean to thee. These a smoke in my wrath, a fire burning all the day.
Behold, it written before me: I will not be silent, but I requited, and I requited upon their bosom,
Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, said Jehovah, who burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills they reproached me: and I measured their former work upon their bosom.
Thus said Jehovah, As the new wine will be found in the cluster, and he will say, Thou shalt not destroy it, for a blessing in it: thus will I do for sake of my servant, to not destroy them all.
And I brought forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah he shall inherit my mountain: and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell their.
And Sharon was for a dwelling of sheep, and the valley of Achor for a resting place of the herd, for my people who sought me.
And ye forsaking Jehovah, forgetting my holy mountain, and preparing a table for Gad, and filling up for fate from mixed wine.
And I numbered you to the sword, and ye all shall bend to the slaughter, because I called, and ye answered not: I spake and ye heard not; and ye will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, ye chose.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat and ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink and ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be ashamed.
Behold, my servants shall shout from good of heart, but ye shall cry from pain of heart, and wail from breaking of spirit.
And ye set down your name for a curse to my chosen: and the Lord Jehovah slaying thee, and he will call his servants another name.
That he praising himself in the earth shall praise himself in the true God; and he swearing in the earth, shall swear in the true God; for the former straits were forgotten, and because they were hid from mine eyes.
For behold me creating new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered, and they shall not come upon the heart.
But be ye glad and rejoice even forever, for what I create: for behold me creating Jerusalem a joy, and her people a rejoicing.
And I rejoiced in Jerusalem, and was glad in my people; and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, and the voice of crying.
There shall be no more from thence a child of days, and an old man who shall not fill up his days: for the boy shall die the son of a hundred years and he sinning, the son of a hundred years, shall be cursed.
And they built houses and they dwelt in them; and they planted vineyards, and they ate the fruit.
They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat: for as the days of a tree the days of my people, and my chosen shall wear out the work of their hands.
They shall not labor in vain, and they shall not bring forth for terror; for they the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
And it was before they shall call, I will answer; they yet speaking, and I will hear.
The wolf and the lamb shall feed as one, and the lion and the ox shall eat straw, and the serpent, dust his bread. They shall not do evil, and they shall not destroy in all my holy mountain, said Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah, The heavens my throne, and the earth the footstool of my feet: where this house which ye will build to me? and where this place of my rest?
And all these my hand made, and all these shall be, says Jehovah: and to this will I look, to the humble and smitten of spirit, and trembling at my word.
He slaughtering the ox, striking a man; he sacrificing a sheep, broke a dog's neck; he bringing up a gift, swine's blood; he making remembrance of frankincense, praising vanity; also they chose their ways, and in their abominations their soul delighted.
Also I will choose upon their vexations, and I will bring their fears to them; for I called, and none answered; I spake, and they heard not: and they will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, they chose.
Hear the word of Jehovah, ye trembling at his word: Your brethren hating you, excluding you for sake of my name, said, Jehovah shall be honored: and he was seen to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah requiting retribution to his enemies.
Bringing forth before she will travail, before pain will come to her, she was delivered of a male.
Who heard such as this? who saw such as these things? shall the earth be made to travail in one day? if a nation shall be brought forth at once? for Zion was pained, she also brought forth her sons.
Shall I cause to break and not cause to bring forth? will Jehovah say: If I cause to bring forth and did I shut up? said thy God.
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad in her, all ye loving her: rejoice with her from joy, all ye mourning over her:
So that ye shall suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation; so that ye shall press out and be delighted from the brightness of her glory.
For thus said Jehovah, Behold me extending peace to her as a river, and as a torrent flowing to the glory of the nations: and ye sucked, ye shall be lifted upon the side, and ye shall be caressed Upon the knees.
As a man whom his mother shall comfort him, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem ye shall be comforted.
And ye saw, and your heart rejoiced, and your bones shall break forth as the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah was known with his servants, and his wrath to his enemies.
For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to turn back in the wrath of his anger, and his rebuke in flames of fire.
For with fire and with sword Jehovah judged all flesh: and the wounded of Jehovah were many.
They consecrating themselves and cleansing themselves in the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse; together shall they perish, says Jehovah.
And I come to gather together all nations and tongues, their works and their purposes; and they came and saw my glory.
And I set a sign among them and I sent those escaping of them to the nations, Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing the bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles far off, that heard not my report, and saw not my glory; and they announced my glory among the nations.
And they brought all your brethren out of all the nations a gift to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said Jehovah, as the sons of Israel shall bring a gift in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.
And I also will take from them for priests, for Levites, said Jehovah.
For as the new heavens and the new earth which I made, standing before me, says Jehovah, so shall stand your seed and your name.
And it was as often as the new moon in its new moon, and as often as the Sabbath in its Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.

The words of Jeremiah son of Hillkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
When the word of Jehovah was to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year to his reigning.
And it will be in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the fulness of the eleventh year to Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Before I shall form thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou shalt go forth from the womb I consecrated thee; I gave thee a prophet to the nations.
And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, behold I knew not to speak: for I a boy.
And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not say, I a boy; for thou shalt go to all to whom I shall send thee, and all which I shall command thee thou shalt speak.
Thou shalt not be afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.
And Jehovah will stretch forth his hand and touch upon my mouth: and Jehovah will say to me, Behold, I gave my words into thy mouth.
See, I appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying, What seem thou, Jeremiah? and saying, I see the shoot of an almond tree.
And Jehovah will say to me, Thou didst well to see; for I watch upon my word to do it.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? and saying, I see a pot blown under, and its face from the face of the north.
And Jehovah will say to me, From the north shall evil be opened upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
For behold me calling to all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they came, and gave a man his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all her walls round about and upon all the cities of Judah.
And I spake my judgment with them concerning all their evil, who forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, and they will worship to the works of their hands.
And thou shalt gird thy loins and rise and speak to them all that I shall command thee: thou shalt not be terrified from their face lest I shall break thee before them.
Behold, I gave thee this day for a fortified city and for a pillar of iron and for a wall of brass upon all the land to the kings of Judah, to her chiefs, to her priests, and to the people of the land.
And they warred against thee; and they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Go and call in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Jehovah, I remembered for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy completion, thy going after me in the desert in a land not, sown.
Israel is holy to Jehovah, the beginning of the produce: all consuming him shall transgress; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.
Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and the families of the house of Israel:
Thus said Jehovah, What iniquity found your fathers in me that they removed far off from me, and went after vanity, and they became vain?
And they said not, Where is Jehovah bringing us up out of the land of Egypt, causing us to go through the desert into a sterile land and a pit, through a land of drought and the shadow of death, through a land not a man passed through it, and not a man dwelt there?
And I will bring you to the land of Carmel, to eat its fruit and its goodness; and ye will come and defile my land, and ye set mine inheritance for an abomination.
The priests said not Where is Jehovah? and they holding the law knew me not: and the shepherds transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and they went After what will not profit.
For this I will even contend, with you, says Jehovah, and with your sons' sons will I contend.
For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider greatly, and see whether there was like this.
Did a nation change their gods, and they no gods? and my people changed their glory for what will not profit.
Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be ye greatly desolate, says Jehovah.
For my people did two evils: they forsook me the fountain of living waters, to hew out for them wells, broken wells which will not hold water.
Is Israel a servant? if he was born in the house wherefore was he for plunder?
Upon him the young lions roared, they gave their voice, they will set his land for a desolation: his cities were burned from not being inhabited.
Also the sons of Noph and Tahapanes, they will feed thee upon the crown of the head.
Wilt thou not do this to thyself? thou didst forsake Jehovah thy God in the time of thy being led in the way.
And now what to thee for the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Sihor? and what to thee to the way of Amur, to drink the water of the river?
Thy wickedness shall correct thee, and thy turnings back shall convict thee: and know thou and see that evil and bitter thy forsaking Jehovah thy God, and that my fear was not to thee, says the Lord Jehovah of armies.
For from of old I broke thy yoke, I burst thy bonds; and thou wilt say, I will not serve; for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou turnest one side, committing fornication:
And I planted thee a vine of purple grapes, wholly a true seed: and how didst thou turn to me the removings of a strange vine?
For if thou shalt wash thyself with nitre, and thou shalt increase to thee cleansing, thine iniquity was graven before me, says the Lord Jehovah.
How wilt thou say, I was not defiled? I went not after the Baalims? See thy way in the valley, know what thou didst; a young she camel entangling her ways;
A wild ass accustomed to the desert in gratifying her soul, panting after the wind in her heat; who shall turn her back? all seeking her will not be wearied; in her new moon they shall find her.
Withhold thy foot from being barefoot, and thy throat from thirst: and thou wilt say, Despairing, no; for I loved strangers, and after them will I go.
As the shame of the thief when he shall be found, so was the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their chiefs, and their priests, and their prophets,
Saying to the wood, Thou my father; and to the stone, Thou didst bring me forth: for they turned to me the back of the neck and not their face: and in the time of their evil they will say, Arise, and save us.
And where thy gods which thou didst make to thee? they will arise, if they shall save thee in the time of thine evil: for from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.
Wherefore will ye contend against me? all ye transgressed against me, says Jehovah.
In vain did I strike your sons; they received no instruction: your sword consumed the prophets as a lion destroying.
O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Was I the desert to Israel? If a land of thick darkness? wherefore said my people, We had dominion, we will come no more to thee?
Will a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her girdles? and my people forgat me days of no numbering.
How wilt thou make good thy way to seek love? for this also thou didst teach the evil ones thy ways.
Also in thy wings were found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: not by breaking in did I find them, but upon all these.
And thou wilt say, Because I was innocent his anger turned back from me. Behold me judging thee for thy saying, I sinned not.
Why wilt thou despise greatly to do the second time thy way? also thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt as thou wert ashamed of Assur.
Also from this thou wilt go forth and thy hands upon thy head: for Jehovah rejected thy trusts and thou shalt not give success to them.
Saying, If a man shall send away his wife, and she went from him and she was to another man, shall he yet turn back to her? Being defiled, shall not that land be defiled? and thou committedst fornication with many shepherds; and turn back to me, says Jehovah.
Lift up thine eyes upon the naked hills and see where thou wert not lain with. Upon the ways thou didst sit for them as the ravens in the desert; and thou wilt defile the land with thy fornications and with thine evil.
And the showers will be withheld, and the latter rain was not; and the forehead of a woman a harlot was to thee, and thou refusedst to be ashamed.
From the time didst thou not call to me, My father, thou the friend of my youth?
Will he guard forever? if he will watch to the end? Behold, I spake, and wilt thou do evil, and shalt thou be able?
And Jehovah will say to me in the days of Josiah the king, Sawest thou what Israel turning back, did? She went up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and she will commit fornication there.
And saying after she did all these, Thou shalt turn back to me. And she turned not back; and her faithless sister Judah will see it.
And I shall see for all the causes that Israel turning away committed adultery, I sent her away and I shall give a writing of her cutting off to her; and her faithless sister Judah was not afraid, and she will go and commit fornication, she also.
And it was her fornication being light, and she will defile the land, and she will commit adultery with stones and with woods.
And also in all this her faithless sister Judah turned not back to me with all the heart, but in falsehood, says Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to me, Israel turning away justified her soul above faithless Judah.
Go and call these words to the north, and say, Turn back, O Israel, turning away, says Jehovah; I will not cause my face to fall upon you: for I am merciful, says Jehovah, I will not guard forever.
Only know thine iniquity that thou didst transgress against Jehovah thy God, and thou wilt scatter thy ways to strangers under every green tree, and to my voice ye heard not, says Jehovah.
Turn back, ye sons having turned away, says Jehovah; for I was lord over you: and I took you one from a city and two from a family, and I brought you to Zion.
And I gave to you shepherds according to my heart, and they fed you with knowledge and understanding.
And it was that ye shall be multiplied and be fruitful in the land in those days, says Jehovah; they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah: and it shall not come up upon the heart, and they shall not remember upon it, and they shall not review and it shall be clone no more.
In that time they shall call to Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; and all nations assembled together to her to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem: and they shall no more go after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
In those days the house of Judah shall go with the house of Israel, and they shall go together out of the land of the north to a land which I caused your fathers to inherit.
And I said, How shall I place thee among the sons, and I will give to thee a land of desire, an inheritance of glory of the armies of nations? And saying, Ye shall call to me, My father; and ye shall rot turn back from after me.
Surely a wife acting faithlessly by her friend, so ye acted faithlessly against me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.
A voice was heard upon the naked hills, weepings, supplications of the sons of Israel: for they perverted their way, they forgot Jehovah their God.

Truly in vain from the hills; the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God the salvation of Israel.
And shame consumed the labor of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their herd, their sons and their daughters.
We shall lie down in our shame, and our reproach will cover us: for we sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God.
If thou wilt turn back, O Israel, says Jehovah; thou shalt turn back to me: and if thou wilt remove thine abominations from my face thou shalt not be moved.
And thou swearest, Jehovah lives in truth, in judgment, and in justice; and the nations were blessed in him, and in him shall they praise.
For thus said Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up to you the fallow ground, and ye shall not sow to thorns.
Be circumcised to Jehovah, and remove the uncircumcision of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath shall come forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching it from the face of the evil of your doings.
Announce ye in Judah, and cause to be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Strike the trumpet in the land: call, fill up, and say, Be ye gathered together and we will go to the fortified cities.

The lion came up from his thicket, and destroying, he broke up the nations; he went forth from his place to set thy land for a desolation; thy cities shall be laid waste from none inhabiting.
For this, be ye girded with sackcloth, lament and wail: for the heat of the anger of Jehovah turned not back from us.
And it was in that day, says Jehovah, the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the chiefs; and the priests were astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.
And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! surely, deceiving, thou didst deceive to this people and to Jerusalem, saying, Peace shall be to you; and the sword reached even to the soul.
In that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A clear wind of the naked hills in the desert the way of the daughter of my people, not for winnowing, and not for separating.
A spirit of fulness above these shall come to me: now will I also speak judgments to them.
Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the whirlwind: his horses were swift above eagles. Wo to us for we were laid waste.
O Jerusalem, wash from evil to thy heart so that thou shalt be saved. How long shall purposes of thy vanity lodge in the midst of thee?
For a voice announcing from Dan, and causing calamity to be heard from mount Ephraim.
Bring ye to remembrance to the nations; behold, cause to be heard against Jerusalem, watchers coming from a land afar off, and they shall give their voice against the cities of Judah.
As watching a field they were against her from round about; for she embittered against me, says Jehovah.
Thy way and thy doings did these things to thee; this thine evil, for it was bitter because it reached even to thy heart.
My bowels, my bowels! I shall afflict the walls of my heart; my heart made commotion to me; I shall not be silent, for the voice of the trumpet thou didst hear, O my soul, the tumult of war.
Breaking upon breaking was called; for all the land was laid waste: suddenly were my tents laid waste, my curtains in a moment.
How long shall I see the signal, shall I hear the voice of the trumpet?
For my people are foolish, they knew me not; foolish sons are they and they not understanding; wise are they to do evil, and to do good they knew not.
I saw the earth, and behold, emptiness and a void; and to the heavens, and no lights.
I saw the mountains, and behold them trembling, and all the hills were shaken.
I saw, and behold, no man, and all the birds of the heavens fled away.
I saw, and behold, Carmel a desert, and all its cities were broken down from the face of Jehovah, from the face of the heat of his anger.
For thus said Jehovah, All the earth shall be a desert; and I will not make a completion.
For this, shall the earth mourn, and the heavens became dark from above: because I spake, I purposed, I lamented not, and I will not turn back from it.
From the voice of the horseman and the throwing of the bowman all the city fled; they went into thickets, and they went up upon rocks: every city was forsaken, and not a man dwelling in them.
And thou being laid waste, what wilt thou do? If thou shalt put on scarlet, if thou shalt adorn thee with ornaments of gold, if thou shalt rend thine eyes with paint, in vain shalt thou beautify thyself: the lovers despised thee; they will Seek thy soul.
For I heard the voice as of her bringing forth, the anguish as of her bearing her first child; the voice of the daughter of Zion, she will sigh, she will spread forth her hands, Wo now to me for my soul fainted for those slaying.
Run ye to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye shall find a man, if there is he doing judgment, seeking faithfulness; and I will pardon to her.
And if Jehovah lives, they will say, for this they will swear to a falsehood.
O Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon faithfulness? thou didst smite them, and they were not pained; thou didst consume them, they refused to take instruction: they made their faces firm above the rock; they refused to turn back.
And I said, Surely, they are weak; they became foolish: for they knew not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God.
I will go for myself to the great ones, and I will speak to them; for they knew the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God: surely they together broke the yoke and tore away the bonds.
For this, a lion from the forest struck them, a wolf of the deserts will destroy them, the panther watched over their cities: every one going forth from thence shall be torn in pieces; for their transgressions were multiplied, their turnings away were strong.

For this, thus said Jehovah, the God of armies, Because ye spake this word, behold me giving my word in thy mouth for fire, and this people wood, and it consumed them.
Behold me bringing upon you a nation from far off, O house of Israel, says Jehovah: it is a nation of strength, it is a nation of old, a nation thou wilt not know its tongue, and thou shalt not hear what it will speak.
Its quiver as a grave being opened, all they are strong.
And it ate thy harvest and thy bread, that thy sons and thy daughters shall eat: it shall eat thy sheep and thine oxen: it shall eat thy vine and thy fig trees: it shall break down thy fortified cities which thou trustedst in them, with the sword.
And also in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make with you a completion.

Consecrate ye war against her; arise, and we will go up at noon. Wo to us! for the day turned away, for the shadows of the evening will stretch forth.
Arise, and we will go up in the night, and we will destroy her fortresses.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, Cut off the wood, and throw up a mound against Jerusalem: this the city to be reviewed; oppression is wholly in her midst.

For the breaking of the daughter of my people was I broken; I was darkened; astonishment took hold of me.
Is there no balsam in Gilead, or healing there? for wherefore did not the health of the daughter of my people go up?
Who will give my head waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears? and I will weep day and night for the wounded of the daughter of my people.
Who will give me in the desert a lodging-place of travelers? and I will leave my people and go from them, for they all commit adultery; an assembly of those acting faithlessly.
And they will bend their tongue, their bow, a lie: and they were not strong for faithfulness upon the land; for from evil to evil they went forth, and they knew me not, says Jehovah.
Watch ye each from his neighbor, and to any brother ye shall not trust, for every brother deceiving, will deceive, and every neighbor will go tale-bearing.
And they will mock, a man upon his neighbor, and they will not speak the truth: they taught their tongue to speak falsehood, they wearied themselves to sin.
Thy dwelling is in the midst of deceit; by deceit they refused to know me, says Jehovah.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me melting them, and I tried them; for how shall I do for the face of the daughter of my people?
Their tongue a deadly arrow, speaking deceit; in his mouth he will speak peace to his neighbor, and be will lay his wait in his midst.
For these things, shall I not review upon them? says Jehovah; or shall not my soul be avenged upon a nation such as this?
For the mountains I will lift up weeping and lamentation, and for the seats of the desert, a song of mourning, for they were burnt, from not a man passing through; and they heard not the voice of cattle: from the bird of the heavens and even to the cattle, they fled away, they departed.
And I gave Jerusalem for heaps and a dwelling of jackals; and the cities of Judah I will give a desolation from none inhabiting.
Who the wise man and he will understand this? and which the mouth of Jehovah spake to him, and he will announce it, for what the land perished it was burnt as the desert, from not being passed through.
And Jehovah will say, For their forsaking my law which I gave before their face, and they heard not to my voice, and they went not in it.
And they went after the stubbornness of their heart, and after the Baalims which their fathers taught them.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me causing this people to eat wormwood, and I gave them to drink water of poison.
And I scattered them in the nations which they knew not, they and their fathers: and I sent after them the sword till I consumed them.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, Give heed, and call ye for the wailing women, and they shall come forth; and send ye to the wise women, and they shall come forth.
And they shall hasten and lift up a lamentation for us, and our eyes shall go down with tears, and our eyelashes shall shake out waters.
For a voice of lamentation was heard from Zion: How were we laid waste! we were greatly ashamed, for we forsook the land, and cast away our dwellings.
For hear, ye women, the word of Jehovah, and your ear shall receive the word of his mouth, and teach ye your daughters lamentation, and a woman her neighbor, the song of mourning.
For death came up into our windows, it came into our palaces to cut off the child from without, the young men from the streets.
Speak: Thus says Jehovah, The carcasses of men fell as dung upon the face of the field, as the handful after the reaper, and none gathering.
Thus said Jehovah, The wise shall not boast in his wisdom, and the strong shall not boast in his strength; the rich shall not boast in his riches:
But he boasting shall boast in this, to understand and know me, that I am Jehovah, doing mercy, judgment and justice in the earth: for in these I delighted, says Jehovah.
Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed over all the circumcised with the uncircumcised;
Over Egypt and over Judah and over Edom, and over the sons of Ammon, and over Moab, and over all cut off of the extremity dwelling in the desert: for all the nations being uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel uncircumcised of heart.
Hear ye the word which Jehovah spake to you, O house of Israel:
Thus said Jehovah, Ye shall not learn according to the way of the nations, and from the signs of the heavens ye shall not be terrified; for the nations will be terrified from them.
For the laws of the peoples, this vanity: for they cut down a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
With gold and with silver they will beautify; with nails and with hammers they will make firm and it will not move.
They are of turned work, as the palm tree, and they shall not speak; being lifted up they shall be lifted up, for they shall not mount up. Ye shall not be afraid of them, for they will not do evil, and also doing good is not with them.
For none like thee, O Jehovah; thou art great, and great thy name in strength.
Who shall not fear thee, thou king of the nations? for to thee he shall come: for among all the wise of the nations, and among all their kings, from none like thee.
And in one they will become brutish, and they will be foolish: the tree itself a correction of vanities.
Silver beaten out shall be brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and the hands of the founder: cerulean purple and red purple their clothing: they all are the work of the wise.
And Jehovah the God of truth; he the living God, and king eternal: from his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not prevail over his anger.
Thus shall ye say to them, The gods who made not the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.
He made the earth in his power, setting upright the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched out the heavens.
At the voice his giving a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he will bring the lifting up from the end of the earth; he made lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.
Every man was brutish from knowledge: every founder was ashamed from his carved image; for his molten image a falsehood, and no spirit in them.
They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of their reviewing they shall perish.
The portion of Jacob not as these: for he forming all things, and Israel the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.
Gather the bundles out of the land, thou dwelling in the fortress.
For thus said Jehovah: Behold me slinging out those inhabiting the land at this once, and I pressed upon them so that they shall find.
Wo to me for my breaking! my blow was sickly; and I said, Surely this a sickness, and I will bear it.
My tent was laid waste, and all my cords were broken: my sons went forth from me, and they are not: none stretched forth my tent any more, and the place of my curtains.
For the shepherds were brutish, and they sought not Jehovah: for this they considered not, and all their flock was scattered.
Behold, a voice of tidings coming, and a great shaking from the land of the north, to set the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling of jackals.
I knew, O Jehovah, that not to man his way; not to man to go and set right his step.
Correct me, O Jehovah, but in judgment, not in thy wrath, lest thou shalt make me small.
Pour out thy wrath upon the nations which knew thee not, and upon the families that called not upon thy name: for they ate up Jacob and consumed him, and they will finish him, and they made desolate his dwelling.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: Cursed the man who will not hear the words of this covenant,
Which I commanded your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the furnace of iron, saying, Hear ye to my voice, and do them according to all that I shall command you: and be to me for a people, and I will be to you for God:
To establish the oath which I sware to your fathers, to give to them a land flowing milk and honey, as this day. And I shall answer and say, Verily, O Jehovah.
And Jehovah will say to me, Call all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.
For testifying, I testified to your fathers in the day of my bringing them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and testifying, saying, Hear ye to my voice.
And they heard not, and inclined not their ear, and they went a man in the stubbornness of their evil heart: and I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which I commanded to do; and they did not.
And Jehovah will say to me, A conspiracy was found in the men of Judah, and in the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
They turned back to the iniquities of their fathers before them who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah brake my covenant which I cut out with their fathers.
For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to them which they shall not be able to go forth from it; and they cried to me and I will not hear to them.
And the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went and cried to the gods which they burnt incense to them: and saving, they will not save to them in the time of their evil.
For from the numbering of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and from the numbering of the streets of Jerusalem, ye set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal.
And thou shalt not pray for this people, and thou shalt not lift up for them an outcry and a prayer: for I hear not in the time of their calling to me for their evil.
What is to my beloved in my house making mischief to many, and they shall cause the holy flesh to pass away from thee? for thou didst evil, then wilt thou exult.
A green olive tree, fair, of fruit of figure, Jehovah called thy name; by the voice of a great noise he kindled a fire upon her, and its branches were evil.
And Jehovah of armies planting thee, spake evil against thee, on account of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah which they did to themselves to irritate me, burning incense to Baal.
And Jehovah made known to me and I shall know: then thou caused me to see their doings.
And I as a gentle lamb being brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that against me they purposed purposes: We will destroy the tree with its food, and we will cut him off from the land of the living, and his name shall no more be remembered.
O Jehovah of armies, judging justice and trying the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance from them, for to thee I uncovered my cause.
For this, thus said Jehovah, concerning the men of Anathoth seeking my soul, saying, Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, and thou shalt not die by our hand.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me reviewing over them: their young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:
And a remnant shall not be to them: for I will bring evil to the men of Anathoth, the year of their reviewing.
Just art thou, O Jehovah, for I will strive to thee: surely I will speak judgments with thee: Wherefore did the way of the evil prosper? all they acting faithlessly with treachery were secure?
Thou didst plant them; they took root; they went on, also they made fruit: thou being near in their mouth, and far off from their reins.
And thou, Jehovah, knew me: thou wilt see me, and thou didst try my heart with thee: pluck them out as sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them to the day of slaughter.
How long shall the land mourn, and the herbage of every field dry up from the evil of those dwelling in it the earth perished, and the birds; for they said, He shall not see our last Part.
If thou didst run with the footmen and they will weary thee, and how wilt thou contend with horses? and in the land of peace thou trustest, and how wilt thou do in the grandeur of Jordan.
For also thy brethren and the house of thy father, they also acted faithlessly with thee; they also called after thee a fulness: thou shalt not believe in them for they will speak to thee good things.
I forsook my house, I rejected mine inheritance; I gave the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
My inheritance was to me as a lion in the forest; she gave upon me with her voice: for this I hated her.
The ravenous hyena is my inheritance to me, rushing round about upon her; go ye, gather together all the beasts of the field, set ye upon to eat her.
Many shepherds destroyed my vineyard, they trod down my portion, they gave the portion of my desire for a desert of desolation.
Setting her for a desolation, she mourned to me; all the land was set a desolation, for no man put upon his heart.
They spoiling came upon all the hills of the desert: for the sword of Jehovah consumed from the extremity of the land even to extremity of the land: no peace to all flesh.
They sowed wheat and they reaped thorns: they were wearied, they shall not profit; and they were ashamed of your gains from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah concerning all my evil neighbors, those touching upon the inheritance which I caused my people Israel to inherit: behold me tearing them up from their land, and I will tear up the house of Judah from the midst of them.
And it was after my tearing them up I will turn back and compassionate them, and cause them to dwell a man to his inheritance, and a man to his land.
And it was if learning, they shall learn the ways of my people to swear in my name, Jehovah lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; and they were built up in the midst of my people.
And if they will not hear, tearing up and destroying, I tore up that nation, says Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah to me, Go buy for thee a girdle of linen, and put it upon thy loins, and thou shalt not cause it to come into water.
And I shall buy the girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and I shall put upon my loins.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying,
Take the girdle that thou boughtest, which is upon thy loins, and arising, go to Euphrates and hide it there in the cleft of the rock.
And I shall go and hide it by Euphrates as Jehovah commanded me.
And it will be from the end of many days, and Jehovah will say to me, Rising, go to Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle which I commanded thee to hide it there.
And I shall go to Euphrates, and dig, and take the girdle from the place which I hid it there: and behold, the girdle was corrupted, it will not profit for anything.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, According to this I will corrupt the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
This evil people, refusing to hear my words, going in the stubbornness of their heart, and they will go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and it shall be as this girdle which shall not profit for anything.
For as the girdle will adhere to the loins of a man, so did I cause to adhere to me all the house of Israel and all the house of Judah, says Jehovah: to be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for glory: and they heard not.
And say to them this word: Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Every flask shall be filled with wine: and they said to thee, Knowing, shall it not be known that every flask shall be filled with wine?
And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me filling all inhabiting this land, and all the kings sitting to David upon his throne, and the priests and the prophets, and all inhabiting Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
And I dashed them in pieces, a man against his brother, and the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, and I will not spare, and I will not compassionate from destroying them.
Hear ye, and give ear; ye shall not be proud: for Jehovah spake.
Ye shall give glory to Jehovah your God, before he shall darken, and before your feet shall strike upon the mountains of darkness, and ye waited for light, and he set it for the shadow of death, he will place for gloom.
And if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in hiding places from the face of pride, and mine eye weeping shall weep and bring down tears, because the flock of Jehovah was taken captive.
Say to the king and to the mistress, Humble yourselves, sit down: for the crown of your glory was brought down from your heads.
The cities of the south were shut up and none opened: Judah was carried away captive, it was all carried away captive, the whole of them.
Lift up your eyes and see them coming from the north: where the flock given to thee, the sheep of thy glory?
What wilt thou say when he shall review upon thee? and thou didst teach them the chiefs for head over thee: shall not pains lay hold of thee as a woman bringing forth?
And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Wherefore did these things <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as: </i></font><b> befal</b><Rf>befall me? for the multitude of thine iniquities thy skirts were uncovered, thy heel treated with violence.
Will the Cushite change his skin and the panther his variegated spots? Ye shall also be able to do good, being taught to do evil.
And I will scatter them as the straw passing away by the wind of the desert.
This thy lot and the portion of thy measure from me, says Jehovah; because thou didst forget me and thou wilt trust in falsehood.
And also I uncovered thy skirts upon thy face and thy dishonor was seen.
Thine adulteries and thy neighings, the purpose of thy harlotry upon the hills, in the field, I saw thine abominations. Wo to thee, O Jerusalem thou wilt not be cleansed after me; how long yet?
The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah concerning the words of the drought.
Judah mourned and her gates languished; they were darkened to the earth, and the outcry of Jerusalem went up.
And their great ones sent their small ones to the waters; they came to the wells, they found no water; they turned back their vessels empty; they were ashamed and disgraced, and they covered their head.
For the land was broken, for there was no rain in the land; the husbandmen were ashamed, they covered their head.
For also the hind brought forth in the field, and forsook, for there was no grass.
And the wild asses stood upon the naked hills, they panted after the wind as the jackals; their eyes failed because no grass.
If our iniquities answered against us, O Jehovah, do for sake of thy name: for our turnings back were many; we sinned against thee.
The hope of Israel, saving him in time of straits, wherefore wilt thou be as a sojourner in the earth, and as a traveler turning aside to lodge?
Wherefore shalt thou be as a man struck dumb? as a strong one he shall not be able to save? and thou in the midst of us, O Jehovah, and thy name was called upon us; thou wilt not leave us.
Thus said Jehovah to this people, Thus they loved to wander, they restrained not their feet, and Jehovah accepted them not; now will he remember their iniquity and he will review their sin.
And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not pray for this people for good.
When they shall fast I hear not their outcry; and when they shall bring up a burnt-offering and gift, I accept them not; for with the sword and by famine and by death I consume them.
And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! behold, the prophets saying to them, Ye shall not see the sword, and famine shall not be to you; for the peace of truth will I give to you in this place.
And Jehovah will say to me, The prophets are prophesying a lie in my name: I sent them not, and I commanded them not, and I spake not to them: a vision of falsehood and a divination, and nought, and the deceit of their heart they are prophesying to you.
For this, thus said Jehovah concerning the prophets prophesying in my name, and I sent them not, and they saying, The sword and famine shall not be in this land; by the sword and by famine shall these prophets die.
And the people which they are prophesying to them shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, from the face of the famine and the sword; and none to them burying them, their wives and their sons and their daughters; and I poured their evil upon them.
And say to them this word: Mine eyes shall bring down tears night and day, and they shall not rest: for the virgin daughter of my people was broken with a great breaking, a very sickly wound.
If I shall go forth into the field, and behold, the wounded of the sword and if I came into the city, and behold, they shall be sick with famine for also the prophet, also the priest went about to a land they knew not.
Rejecting, didst thou reject Judah? if thy soul abhorred in Zion? wherefore didst thou smite us, and no healing to us? waiting for peace, and no good; and for a time of healing, and behold terror.
We knew, O Jehovah, our evil, the iniquity of our fathers: for we sinned to thee.
Thou wilt not despise us; for sake of thy name, thou wilt not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, thou wilt not break thy covenant with us.
Is there among the vanities of the nations those causing ruin? and if the heavens will give showers? Art not thou he, Jehovah our God? And we will wait for thee: for thou didst make all these.
And Jehovah will say to me, If Moses shall stand, and Samuel, before my face, my soul not to this people: casting from my face they shall go forth.
And it was if they shall say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Whom for death to death; and whom for the sword to the sword; and whom for famine to famine; and whom for captivity to captivity.
And I reviewed over them four kinds, says Jehovah: the sword to kill, and dogs to tear in pieces, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to consume and destroy.
And I gave them for maltreatment to all the kingdoms because of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
For who shall have compassion upon thee, O Jerusalem? and who shall bewail for thee? and who shall turn aside to ask for thy peace?
Thou didst reject me, says Jehovah; thou wilt go backward; and I will stretch forth my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee; I was weary of lamenting.
And I will scatter them with a scattering in the gates of the land; I bereaved of offspring, I destroyed my people; they turned not back from their ways.
Their widows were many to me above the sand of the seas: I brought to them against the mother a young man laying waste at noon: I caused to fall upon her suddenly wrath and terror.
She bringing forth seven, languished: she breathed out her soul; her sun went down in the midst of the day: she was ashamed and blushed: and their remainder I will give to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.
Wo to me, my mother, for thou broughtest me forth a man of strife and a man of contention to all the earth. I lent not on interest and they lent not to me on interest: they are altogether cursing me.
Jehovah said, If to do well to thy remnant; if not, I caused the enemy in the time of evil and in time of straits to supplicate to thee.
Shall iron break the iron of the north, and brass?
Thy strength and thy treasures I will give for a spoil not for price, and in all thy sins and in all thy bounds.
And I caused to pass with thine enemies into a land thou knewest not: for a fire was kindled in my wrath; it shall burn upon you.
Thou knewest, O Jehovah: remember me, and review me, and avenge for me from him pursuing me; not for being slow of thy wrath wilt thou take me away; know, I suffered reproach for thee.
Thy words were found, and eating them; and thy word will be to me for the gladness and for the joy of my heart: for thy name was called upon me, Jehovah the God of armies.
I sat not in the assembly of those mocking, and I will not exult; from the face of thy hand I sat alone, for thou didst fill me with anger.
Wherefore was my pain everlasting and my blow incurable, refusing to be healed? Being, wilt thou be to me as falsehood, the waters were not faithful?
For this, thus said Jehovah, If thou wilt turn back, and I will turn thee back, thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt bring forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall turn back to thee and thou shalt not turn back to them.
And I gave thee to this people for a wall of brass, fortified: and they shall war against thee, and they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, says Jehovah.
And I delivered thee out of the hand of the evil, and I redeemed thee from the hand of the terrible.
And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Thou shalt not take to thee a wife, and sons and daughters shall not be to thee in this place.
For thus said Jehovah concerning the sons, and concerning the daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers bearing them, and concerning their fathers begetting them in this land:
Deaths of diseases shall they die; they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth, and by sword and by famine shall they be consumed, and their carcass was for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
For thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not go in to the house of wailing, and thou shalt not go to lament and thou shalt not deplore for them, for I took away my peace from this people, says Jehovah; kindness and mercies.
And the great and small died in this land: they shall not be buried, and they shall not lament for them, and none shall cut himself or make bald for them:
They shall not break bread in mourning to comfort him for the dead; and they shall not give them to drink the cup of consolations for his father and for his mother.
And to the house of drinking thou shalt not go in to sit with them to eat and to drink.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me causing to cease from this place to your eyes and in your days the voice of gladness and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
And being when thou shalt announce to this people all these words, and they said to thee, For what did Jehovah speak against us all this great evil? and what our iniquities? and what our sins which we sinned to Jehovah our God?
And say to them, Because your fathers forsook me, says Jehovah, and went after other gods, and they will serve them and worship to them, and they forsook me, and my law they watched not;
And ye acted wickedly to do more than your fathers; and behold, you going a man after the stubbornness of his evil heart for not hearing to me.
And I cast you out from this land upon the land which ye knew not, ye and your fathers; and ye served there other gods day and night, where I will not give to you mercy.
For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be said, Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
But Jehovah lives who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where he thrust them away there: and I turned them back upon their land which I gave to their fathers.
Behold me sending for many fishers, says Jehovah, and they fished them; and after this I will send for many hunters, and they hunted them from every mountain, and from every hill, and from the clefts of the rocks.
For mine eyes are upon all their ways, and they were not hid from my face, and their iniquity was not concealed from before mine eyes.
And I requited first double their iniquity and their sin, for their defiling my land, with the carcasses of their abominable things, and their abominations they filled up mine inheritance.
O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in days of straits, to thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and they shall say, Surely our fathers inherited falsehood, vanity, and no receiving profit in them.
Shall man make to himself gods, and they not gods?
For this, behold me causing them to know in this once, I will cause them to know my hand and my strength; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.
The sin of Judah was written with a style of iron, with the nail of diamond: being graved upon the table of their heart, and to the horns of your altars.
For their sons remember their altars and their images by the green tree upon the high hills.
O my mountain in the field, thy strength, all thy treasures I will, give for plunder, thy heights for sin in all thy bounds.
And thou wert thrust in thyself from thine inheritance which I gave to thee; and I caused thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou knewest not: for ye kindled a fire in mine anger; it shall burn forever.
Thus said Jehovah: Cursed the man who shall trust in man, and set flesh his arm, and shall turn away his heart from Jehovah.
And he was as ruins in the sterile region, and he shall not see when good shall come; he inherited the arid places in the desert, a salt land, and it shall not be inhabited.
Blessed the man who shall trust in Jehovah, and his trust was Jehovah.
And he was as a tree planted by the waters, and it shall spread out its roots by the river, and it shall not see when heat shall come, and its leaf was green; and it shall not be afraid in the year of restraint, and it shall not withdraw from making fruit.
The heart is deceitful above all, and man himself, who shall know him?
I Jehovah searching the heart, trying the reins, to give to each according to his way, according to the fruit of his doings.
The partridge brooded and she brought not forth; to make riches and not in judgment, he shall leave them in the half of his days, and in his latter part he shall be foolish.
A throne of glory being lifted up from the first our holy place.
The hope of Israel, O Jehovah, all forsaking thee shall be ashamed, turning away from me they shall be written in the earth, for they forsook the fountain of the water of life, Jehovah.
Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou my praise.
Behold them saying to me, Where the word of Jehovah? it shall come now.
And I withdrew not from following after thee; I desired not man's day, thou knewest: the going forth of my lips was straight before thee.
Thou wilt not be for a terror to me; thou my refuge in the evil day.
They pursuing me shall be ashamed, and I shall not be ashamed: they shall be dismayed, and I shall not be dismayed: bring upon them the evil day, and break them with a double breaking.
Thus said Jehovah to me: Go and stand in the gate of the sons of the people which the kings of Judah shall come in in it, and which they shall go forth in it, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.
And say to them, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all inhabiting Jerusalem, coming in by these gates:
Thus said Jehovah: Watch ye in your souls, and ye shall not lift up a lifting up in the day of the Sabbath, and bring in by the gates of Jerusalem.
And ye shall not bring forth a burden from your houses in the day of the Sabbath, and all work ye shall not do, and consecrate the day of the Sabbath as I commanded your fathers.
And they heard not, and they inclined not their ear, and they will harden their neck not to hear, and not to receive instruction.
And it was, if hearing, ye shall hear to me, says Jehovah, not to bring a burden into the gates of this city in day of the Sabbath, and to consecrate the day of the Sabbath, not to do in it any work;
And there came into the gates of this city kings and chiefs sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and upon horses, they and their chiefs, men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city was inhabited forever.
And they came from the cities of Judah and from round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountain, and from the south, bringing a burnt-offering and sacrifice, and gift, and frankincense, and bringing praise into the house of Jehovah.
And if ye will not hear to me to consecrate the day of the Sabbath, not to lift up a burden, and coming into the gates of Jerusalem in the day of the Sabbath; and I kindled a fire in her gates and it consumed the palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my word.
And I shall go down to the potter's house, and behold him doing a work upon the stone.
And the vessel which he made was destroyed as clay in the hand of the potter: and he turned back, and he will make another vessel as was right in the eyes of the potter to make.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
As this potter shall I not be able to do to you, O house of Israel? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay in the hand of the potter, thus are ye in my hand, O house of Israel.
The moment I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy:
And that nation which I spake against it turned back from its evil, and I lamented for the evil which I proposed to do to it.
And the moment I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant:
And it did evil in mine eyes not to hear to my voice, and I lamented for the good which I said to do well to it.
And now, say now to the men of Judah, and concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said Jehovah: Behold, I will form evil against you, and purpose a purpose against you; turn ye back now each from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
And they said, We shall despair; for after our purposes we will go, and we will do each the stubbornness of his evil heart.
For this, thus said Jehovah: Ask now among the nations, who heard like as these things: the virgin of Israel did very horrible things.
Shall the field cut loose from the rock the snow of Lebanon? or shall the cold flowing waters of an inundation be dried up?
Because my people forgat me they will burn incense in vain; by their ways they will cause the paths of old to fail, to go beaten paths, a way not cast up;
To set their land for a desolation, eternal hissings; every one passing over it shall be astonished and shall shake with his head.
As the east wind I will scatter them before the face of the enemy; I will cause them to see the neck and not the face, in the day of their destruction.
And they will say, Come, and we will purpose purposes against Jeremiah; for law shall not perish from the priest, and counsel from the wise, and the word from the prophet Come, and we will strike him with the tongue, and we will not attend to any of his words.
Attend to me, O Jehovah, and hear for the voice of mine adversary.
Shall evil be requited for good? for they dug a pit for my soul. Remember my standing before thee to speak good for them, to turn back thy wrath from them.
For this, give their sons to the famine, and pour them out upon the hands of the sword; and their wives shall be bereaved of offspring, and be widows; and their men shall be slain by death; their young men struck of the sword in battle.
A cry shall be heard from their houses, for thou shalt bring upon them a trap suddenly, for they dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.
And thou, O Jehovah, knewest all their counsel against me to kill: thou wilt not expiate for their iniquity, and their sin from before thee thou wilt not wipe away, and they shall be weak before thee; do with them in the time of thine anger.
Thus said Jehovah, Go and buy a potter's earthen bottle, and from the old men of the people and from the old men of the priests;
And go forth to the valley of the, son of Hinnom, which is at the opening of the gate of the pottery, and call there the words which I shall speak to thee.
And say, Hear the word of Jehovah, ye kings of Judah, and ye dwelling in Jerusalem; Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: Behold me bringing evil upon this place, which every one hearing it, their ears shall tingle.
Because they forsook me and rejected this place, and they will burn incense in it to other gods which they knew them not, they and their fathers, and the kings of Judah; and they filled this place with the blood of the innocent ones.
And they built the heights of Baal to burn their sons with fire, burnt-offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, and I spake not, and it came not up upon my heart.
For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and it shall no more be called to this place Tophet, and The valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter.
And I emptied out the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I caused them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them seeking their soul: and I gave their carcasses for food to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
And I set this city for a desolation, and for hissing: every one passing over it shall be astonished and shall hiss over all her blows.
And I caused them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and each the flesh of his neighbor shall they eat in the straitness and in the distress which their enemies, and they seeking their souls, shall press upon them.
And break the bottle before the eyes of the men going with thee,
And say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: According to this will I break this people and this city, as he will break the potter's vessel which shall not be able to be healed any more: and in Tophet shall they bury, from not a place to bury.
Thus will I do to this place, says Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, and to give this city as Tophet:
And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah were defiled as the place of Tophet to all the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to all the army of the heavens, and pouring out libations to other gods.
And Jeremiah will come from Tophet where Jehovah sent him there to prophesy; and he will stand in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah and say to all the people,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing to this city and upon all her cities all the evil which I spake against her, because they hardened their neck not to hear my word.
And Pashur, son of Immer the priest, and he appointed overseer of the house of Jehovah, will hear Jeremiah prophesying these words.
And Pashur will strike Jeremiah the prophet and give him upon the stocks which were in the gate of Benjamin the highest, which were in the house of Jehovah.
And it will be on the morrow, and Pashur will bring forth Jeremiah from the stocks. And Jeremiah will say to him, Jehovah called not thy name Pashur, but Terror from round about.
For thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving thee for terror to thyself and to all loving thee; and they fell by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes seeing: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babel, and he carried them captive to Babel, and be struck them with the sword.
And I gave all the strength of this city, and all her labors, and everything precious of hers, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, and they spoiled them, and took them and brought them to Babel.
And thou, Pashur, and all dwelling in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babel, and thou shalt die there, and there shalt thou be buried, and all those loving thee to whom thou didst prophesy to them in falsehood.
Thou didst persuade me, O Jehovah, and I shall be persuaded: thou didst hold me fast, and thou wilt prevail: I was for a derision all the day, all mocking to me.
For as often as I shall speak I shall cry; violence and oppression I shall call; for the word of Jehovah was to me for a reproach and for a derision all the day.
And I said, I will not bring him to remembrance, and I will no more speak in his name. And it was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was wearied to endure, and I shall not be able.
For I heard the slander of many, terror from round about Announce ye, and we will announce. Every man of my peace watching my halting: perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we will take our vengeance of him.
And Jehovah is with me as a strong terrible one: for this, they pursuing shall be weak, and they shall not prevail; they were greatly ashamed, for they prospered not; perpetual shame shall not be forgotten.
And Jehovah of armies trying the just, seeing the reins and the heart, I shall see thy vengeance of them: for to thee I uncovered my cause.
Sing ye to Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah: for he delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of those doing evil.
Cursed the day which I was born in it; the day which my mother brought me forth shall not be blessed.
Cursed the man who announced to my father, Good news; saying, A son, a male was born to thee; with rejoicing, making him rejoice.
And that man being as the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and lamented not: and hearing the cry in the morning and the loud noise in time of noon.
Because he killed me not from the womb, and my mother will be to me my grave, and her womb pregnant forever.
Wherefore this came I forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, and my days shall be finished with shame?
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in king Zedekiah's sending to him Pashur son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah son Maaseiah the priest, saying,
Seek now: Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel is warring against us; perhaps Jehovah will do with us his wonders, and he shall go up from us.
And Jeremiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:
Thus said Jehovah God of Israel: Behold me turning about the weapons of war which are in your hands which ye are fighting with them with the king of Babel, and the Chaldeans, pressing upon you without the wall, and I gathered you to the midst of this city.
And I warred with you with a hand stretched out and with an arm of strength, and in anger and in heat and in great wrath.
And I struck the inhabitants of this city, and man and beast: in great death they shall die.
And after this, says Jehovah, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those being left in this city, from death, from the sword, and from famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them seeking their soul: and he smote them with the mouth of the sword; he shall not have compassion upon them, and he shall not spare, and he shall not pity.
And to this people thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving before your face the way of life and the way of death.
He dwelling in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by death: and he going forth and falling to the Chaldeans pressing upon you, shall live, and his soul was to him for booty.
For I set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah: into the hand of the king of Babel shall it be given, and it was burnt with fire.
And for the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:
O house of David, thus said Jehovah, Judge judgment for the morning, and deliver him taken by force from the hand of him oppressing, lest my wrath shall go forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching from the face of the evil of your doings.
Behold me against thee, thou inhabitress of the valley, rock of the plain, says Jehovah; those saying, Who shall come down against us? and who shall come into our habitations?
And I reviewed over you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah: and I kindled a fire in her forest, and it consumed all round about her.
Thus said Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,
And say, Hear thou the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, sitting upon the throne of David, thou and thy servants, and thy people coming in to these gates:
Thus said Jehovah, Do ye judgment and justice, and deliver him taken by force, from the hand of him oppressing: ye shall not be violent, ye shall not oppress the stranger, the orphan, and the widow, and ye shall not pour but innocent blood in this place.
For if doing, ye shall do this word, and kings came into the gates of this house, sitting to David upon his throne, riding in chariots and upon horses, he send his servants and his people.
And if ye will not bear these words, by myself I sware, says Jehovah, that this house shall be for a desolation.
For thus said Jehovah, concerning the house of the king of Judah: Thou Gilead to me, the head of Lebanon, if I shall not set thee a desert cities not inhabited.
And I consecrated destroyers against thee, a man and his weapons: and they cut off from the chosen of thy cedars and cast upon the fire.
And many nations passed through this city, and they said a man to his neighbor, For what did Jehovah thus to this great city?
And they said, Because they forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and they will worship to other gods, and serve them.
Ye shall not weep for the dead, and ye shall not bewail for him: weep ye, weep ye for him going away, for he shall no more turn back and see the land of his nativity.
For thus said Jehovah to Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, reigning, instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place: He shall no more return there:
For in the place where they carried him captive, there he shall die, and shall no more see this land.
Wo to him building his house not with justice, and his upper chambers not with judgment; by his neighbor he will work gratuitously, and he will give him not for his work;
Saying, I will build to me a house of extension, and airy upper chambers, and he rent to himself windows; and covered with cedar, and painted with red.
Shalt thou reign, for thou art kindled with cedar? did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice, then it was well to him?
He judged the judgment of the poor and the needy; then it was well: was this not knowing me? says Jehovah.
For thine eyes and thy heart not but for thy plunder and for guiltless blood to pour out, and for oppression and for running, to do.
For this, thus said Jehovah of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: They shall not lament for him: Alas, my brother! and, Alas, sister! they shall not lament for him, Alas, lord! and, Alas, the majesty!
He shall be buried the burial of an ass, dragged and cast from beyond the gate of Jerusalem.
Go up to Lebanon and cry, and in Basilan thou shalt give thy voice and cry from the passages, for all they loving thee were broken.
I spake to thee in thy, securities, thou saidst, I will not hear. This thy way from thy youth, for thou heardest not to my voice.
The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and they loving thee shall go into captivity: for then shalt thou be ashamed and disgraced for all thine evil.
Thou dwelling in Lebanon, building a nest in the cedars, how being compassionated in pangs coming to thee the pain as of her bringing forth.
I live says Jehovah, for if Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, shall be the seal upon my right hand, I will pluck thee off from thence.
And I gave thee into the hand of those seeking thy soul, and into the hand of whom thou fearest their face, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
And I cast thee and thy mother who bare thee upon another land where ye were not born there, and there shall ye die.
And upon the land where they lift up their soul to turn back there, there they shall not turn back.
Is this man Coniah a despised broken earthen vessel? or a vessel no delight in it? wherefore they were cast out, he and his seed, and they were cast upon a land which they knew not.
O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah, Write ye this man destitute, a man shall not prosper in his days: for not a man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling yet in Judah.
Wo to the shepherds destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture! says Jehovah.
For this, thus said Jehovah God of Israel, against the shepherds feeding my people: Ye scattered my flock and ye will thrust them away, and ye reviewed them not: behold me reviewing over you the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.
And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I thrust them away there, and I turned them back to their rests, and they were fruitful and multiplied.
And I set up shepherds over them, and they fed them; and they shall no more fear, and they shall not be terrified, and they shall not be reviewed, says Jehovah.
Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up to David a just sprout, and a king reigned and prospered, and he did judgment and justice in the earth.
In his days shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell with confidence: and this his name which he shall be called: Jehovah Our Justice.
For this, behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and they shall no more say, Jehovah lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
But But Jehovah lives who brought up and who caused the seed of the house of Israel to come from the land of the north, and from all the lands where I thrust them away there; and they shall dwell upon their land.
For the prophets my heart was broken in the midst of me, and all my bones were relaxed; I was as a man intoxicated, and as a man wine passing over him, from the face of Jehovah, and from the face of the words of his holiness.
For the land was filled from adulteries, for from the face of these the land mourned, the beautiful things of the desert were dried up, and their race will be evil, and their strength not right.
For also the prophets, also the priests were polluted; also in my house I found their evil, says Jehovah.
For this their way shall be to them as slippery places in darkness: they shall be thrust away and they fell in it; for I will bring evil upon them, the year of their reviewing, says Jehovah.
And I saw folly in the prophets of Shomeron; they prophesied in Baal, and they will cause my people Israel to wander.
And in the prophets of Jerusalem I saw a horrible thing, committing adultery and going in falsehood: and they strengthened the hands of those doing evil, they turned not back a man from his evil: they were to me all of them as Sodom, and those dwelling in her as Gomorrah.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the prophets, Behold me feeding them with wormwood, and I caused to drink the water of poison: for from the prophets of Jerusalem went forth profaneness to all the earth.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, Ye shall not hear to the words of the prophets prophesying to you; they making you vain: they will speak the vision of their heart, not from the mouth of Jehovah.
Saying to say to those despising the word of Jehovah, There shall be peace to you; and every one going in the stubbornness of his heart, they said, Evil shall not come to you.
For who stood in the consultation of Jehovah, and will see and hear his word who attended to his word and will hear?
Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a piercing storm; it shall be hurled upon the head of the evil ones.
The anger of Jehovah shall not turn back till his doing, and till his setting up the purposes of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall understand in it with understanding.
I sent not the prophets, and they ran; I spake not to them, and they prophesied.
And if they stood in my consultation, and they will cause my people to hear my word, and turn them back from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.
Am I God from near, says Jehovah, and not God from far off?
If a man shall hide in secret places and I shall not see him, says Jehovah. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? says Jehovah.
I heard what the prophets said, prophesying a falsehood in my name, saying, I dreamed, I dreamed.
How long is it in the heart of the prophets prophesying a lie, and prophesying the deceit of their heart?
Reckoning to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they will recount a man to his neighbor, as their fathers forgat my name in Baal.
The prophet whom with him a dream, he will recount a dream; and whom my word with him, he will speak my word in truth. What to the straw with the grain? says Jehovah.
So is not my word as fire? says Jehovah; and as a hammer, it will break the rock in pieces.
For this, behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, stealing my words, a man from his neighbor.
Behold me against the prophets, says Jehovah, taking their tongue, and they will mutter an oracle.
Behold me against them prophesying dreams of falsehood, says Jehovah, and they will recount them, and will cause my people to wander by their falsehoods and by their boasting; and I sent them not, and I commanded them not; and helping, they shall be of no profit to this people, says Jehovah.
And when this people, or prophet, or priest, shall ask thee, saying, What the burden of Jehovah? and thou saidst to them, What burden? And I cast you off, says Jehovah.
And the prophet and the priest and the people which shall say, The burden of Jehovah, and I reviewed upon that man, and upon his house.
Thus shall ye say, a man to his neighbor, a man to his brother, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?
And ye shall no more make mention of the burden of Jehovah, for the burden to a man shall be his word; and ye perverted the words of the living God, Jehovah of armies our God.
Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What answered Jehovah? and what spake Jehovah?
And if ye shall say, The burden of Jehovah; for this, thus said Jehovah, Because ye said this word, The burden of Jehovah, and I shall send to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of Jehovah:
Therefore behold me, and neglecting, I deserted you, and I cast you off, and the city which I gave to you and to your fathers from my face.
And I gave upon you an eternal reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
Jehovah showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the face of the temple of Jehovah, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel carried away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the chiefs of Judah and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and he will bring them to Babel.
One basket of figs exceedingly good as the figs first ripe, and the one basket of figs exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.
And Jehovah will say to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? and saying, Figs: the good figs, exceedingly good; and the evil, exceedingly evil, which shall not be eaten from being evil.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel: As these good figs, so will I know the captivity of Judah which I sent out of this place to the land of the Chaldeans for good.
And I set mine eyes upon them for good, and I turned them back upon this land: and I built them, and I will not pull down: and I planted them, and I will not pluck up.
And I gave to them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God: for they shall turn back to me with all their heart.
And as the evil figs which shall not be eaten from being evil; for thus said Jehovah, So will I give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his chiefs, and the remainder of Jerusalem, those remaining in this land, and those dwelling in the land of Egypt:
And I gave them for maltreatment, and for evil to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a reproach and for a parable, and for a derision, and for a curse in, all the places which I shall thrust them away there.
And I sent among them the sword, the famine, and the death, even to the consuming them from off the land which I gave to them and to their fathers.
The word which was to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this the first year to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.
Which Jeremiah the prophet spake to all the people of Judah, all dwelling in Jerusalem, saying,
From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, and even to this day, this the three and twentieth year, the word of Jehovah was to me, and I will speak to you, rising early and speaking, and ye heard not.
And Jehovah sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and ye heard not, and ye inclined not your ear to hear.
Saying, Turn back now each from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell upon the land which Jehovah gave to you and to your fathers to from forever and even to forever.
And ye shall not go after other gods to serve them and to worship to them, and ye shall not irritate me in the work of your hands; and I will not do evil to you.
And ye heard not to me, says Jehovah; so as to irritate me in the works of your hands for evil to you.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies: Because ye heard not my word,
Behold me sending, and I took all the families of the north, says Jehovah, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant, and I brought them against this land and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations round about, and I devoted them to destruction, and I set them for a desolation and for a hissing, and for perpetual wastes.
And I destroyed from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the two millstones and the light of the lamp.
All this land was for a waste, for a desolation, and these nations served the king of Babel seventy years.
And it was when seventy years were filled up, I will review over the king of Babel and upon this nation, says Jehovah, their iniquity, and upon the land of the Chaldeans, and I set it for eternal desolations.
And I brought upon this land all the words I spake against it, all being in this book which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations.
For many nations they also served upon them, and great kings: and I requited to them according to their work and according to the doings of their hands.
For thus said Jehovah God of Israel to me: Take the cup of wine of this wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations which I sent thee to them to drink it.
And they drank and they staggered, and they were mad from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of them.
And I shall take the cup from the hand of Jehovah, and I shall cause all the nations which Jehovah sent me to them to drink.
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah and her kings, her chiefs, to give them for a waste and for a desolation, and for a hissing and for a cursing; as this day.
Pharaoh king of Egypt and his servants, and his chiefs, and all his people.
And all the intermingled, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the rovers, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,
Edom and Moab and the sons of Ammon,
And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the island which is beyond the sea,
Dedan and Tema, and Buz, and all the cutting off the extremity,
And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the intermingled dwelling in the desert,
And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes.
And all the kings of the North, being near and being far off, a man to his brother, and all the kingdoms of the land which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
And say to them, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Drink ye and be drunken, and vomit and fall, and ye shall not rise from the face of the sword which I sent in the midst of you.
And it was if they shall refuse to take the cup from my hand to drink, and say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Drink ye; ye shall drink.
For behold me beginning to do evil upon the city which my name was called upon it; and shall ye being acquitted be unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished, for I call a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of armies.
And thou shalt prophesy to them all these words, and say to them; Jehovah shall roar from on high, and he will give his voice from his holy habitation; roaring, he will roar from his seat; he shall cry aloud as they treading, to all the inhabitants of the earth.
A noise came even to the extremity of the earth; for a strife to Jehovah with the nations; he judged for all flesh; he gave them being evil, to the sword, says Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.
And the wounded of Jehovah were in that day from the extremity of the earth and even to the extremity of the earth: they shall not be lamented, and they shall not be gathered, and they shall not be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves, ye chiefs of the flocks; for your days for slaughter and your dispersions were filled up, and ye fell as a vessel of desire.
And flight perished from the shepherds, and escaping from the chiefs of the flock.
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and wailing of the chiefs of the flock, for Jehovah laid waste their pasture.
And the dwellings of peace were destroyed from the face of the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
He forsook his booth as the young lion: for their land was for a desolation from the face of the burning of him oppressing, and from the face of the burning of his anger.
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, was this word from Jehovah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, Stand in the enclosure of the house of Jehovah and speak to all the cities of Judah coming to worship in the house of Jehovah, all the words which I command thee to speak to them; thou shalt not withhold a word.
Perhaps they will hear and turn back a man from his evil way, and I lamented for the evil which I purposed to do to them from the face of the evil of their doings.
And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, If ye will not hear to me to go in my law which I gave before your face,
To hear to the words of my servants the prophets which I sent to you, and rising early and sending, and ye heard not;
And I gave this house as Shiloh, and this city I will give for cursing to all the nations of the earth.
And the priests and the prophets and all the people will hear Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
And it will be as Jeremiah finished to speak all which Jehovah commanded to speak to all the people, and the priests and the prophets and all the people will seize him, saying, Dying, thou shalt die.
Wherefore didst thou prophesy in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be as Shiloh, and this city shall be laid waste from none inhabiting? And all the people will be convoked together to Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
And the chiefs of Judah will hear these words, and they will come up from the king's house to the house of Jehovah, and they will sit in the opening of the new gate of Jehovah.
And the priests and the prophets will say to the chiefs, and to all the people, saying, The judgment of death for this man, for he prophesied against this city, as ye heard with your ears.
And Jeremiah will say to all the chiefs and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words which ye heard.
And now make good your ways and your doings, and hear to the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against you.
And I, behold me in your hand do to me as the good and right in your eyes:
But knowing, ye shall know that if ye put me to death, that ye give innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city, and to her inhabitants: for in truth Jehovah sent me to you to speak in your ears all these words.
And the chiefs will say, and all the people to the priests and to the prophets: Not for this man the judgment of death, for in the name of Jehovah his God he spake to us.
And men will rise up from the old men of the land, and they will say to all the convocation of the people, saying,
Micah the Morasthite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and he will say to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies: Zion shall be ploughed a field, and Jerusalem shall be ruins, and the mountain of the house for the heights of a forest.
Putting to death, did Hezekiah king of Judah put him to death, and all Judah? Did he not fear Jehovah, and wait for the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah will lament for the evil which he spake against them? And we are doing great evil against our souls.
And also a man was prophesying in the name of Jehovah, Urijah son of Shemaiah, from the city of the forests, and he will prophesy against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
And king Jehoiakim will hear, and all the great ones, and all the chiefs, his words, and the king will seek to kill him: and Urijah will hear and be afraid, and he will flee and go to Egypt.
And king Jehoiakim will send men to Egypt, Elnathan, son of Achbor, and men with him to Egypt.
And they will bring forth Urijah from Egypt and bring him to king Jehoiakim; and he will strike him with the sword, and cast his carcass into the graves of the sons of the people.
But the hand of Ahikam son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah not to give him into the hand of the people to kill him.
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah was this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah to me: Make to thee bonds and rods and give them upon thy neck,
And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the sons of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of messengers coming to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;
And command them to say to their lords, Thus said Jehovah of armies God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to your lords:
I made the earth, the man and the cattle which are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by mine arm stretched forth, and I gave it to whom was right in mine eyes.
And now I gave all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant; and also the beasts of the field gave I to him to serve him.
And all the nations served him, and his son, and his son's son, even till the time itself also of his land came: and many nations and great kings served upon him.
And it was the nation and kingdom which shall not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and which shall not give his neck in the yoke of the king of Babel, with the sword and with famine and with death I will review upon that nation, says Jehovah, even to my finishing them by his hand.
And ye shall not hear to your prophets and to your divinations, and to your dreamers, and to those of you practicing magic, and to your sorcerers, which they are saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel:
For they are prophesying a lie to you so as to remove you far off from your land; and I thrust you away, and ye perished.
And the nation which shall bring his neck into the yoke of the king of Babel and serve him, and I gave him rest upon his land, says Jehovah; and he worked it, and dwelt in it.
And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spake according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks into the yoke of the king of Babel, and serve him and his people, and live.
Wherefore will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword and by famine and by death, as Jehovah spake against the nation who will not serve the king of Babel?
And ye shall not bear to the words of the prophets, saying to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babel; for they are prophesying a lie to you.
For I sent them not, says Jehovah, and they are prophesying in my name for falsehood; for my thrusting you away, and ye perish, ye, and the prophets prophesying to you.
And to the priests and to all this people I spake, saying, Thus said Jehovah: Ye shall not hear to the words of your prophets prophesying to you, saying, Behold the vessels of the house of Jehovah being now turned back from Babel speedily: for they are prophesying a lie to you.
Ye shall not hear to them; serve ye the king of Babel, and live: wherefore shall this city be laid waste?
And if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be with them, they shall now supplicate to Jehovah of armies for the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah, in Jerusalem, not to go into Babel.
For thus said Jehovah of armies concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the remainder of the vessels being left in this city.
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took them not in his carrying away captive Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem into Babel, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, concerning the vessels being left in the house of Jehovah, and the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem:
They shall be brought to Babel, and there shall they be till the day of my reviewing them, says Jehovah; and I brought them up and turned them back to this place.
And it will be in this year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azur the prophet which was from the hill, said to me in the house of Jehovah, before the eyes of the priests, and all the people, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saving, I broke the yoke of the king of Babel.
In yet two years of days I turn back to this place all the vessels of the house of Jehovah which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel took from this place, and brought them to Babel.
And Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim King of Judah, and all the captivity of Judah going to Babel, I turn back to this place, says Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babel.
And Jeremiah the prophet will say to Hansaiah the prophet, before the eyes of the priests and before the eyes of all the people standing in the house of Jehovah,
And Jeremiah the prophet will say, Verily: so will Jehovah do: will Jehovah raise up thy words which thou didst prophesy, to turn back the vessels of the house of Jehovah, and all the captivity from Babel to this place.
But hear now this word which I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people.
The prophets which were before me and before thee from of old, and they will prophesy to many lands and against great kingdoms, for war and for evil and for death.
The prophet which will prophesy for peace in the coming of the word of the prophet, the prophet shall be known: that Jehovah sent him in truth.
And Hananiah the prophet will take the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, and break it.
And Hananiah will say before the eyes of all the people, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Thus will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babel in yet two years of days from off the neck of all the nations. And Jeremiah the prophet will go to his way.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet broke the yoke from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
Go and say to Hananiah, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Thou didst break the staves of wood; but make instead of them staves of iron.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, I gave an iron yoke upon the neck of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel: and they served him: and also the beasts of the field I gave to him.
And Jeremiah the prophet will say to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; Jehovah sent thee not; and thou didst cause this people to trust upon falsehood.

And Hananiah the prophet will die in this year in the seventh month.
And these the words of the writing which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remnant of the old men of the captivity, and to the priests and to the prophets, and to all the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babel;
(After the going forth of Jeconiah, the king and the mistress, and the eunuchs, the chiefs of Judah and Jerusalem, and the artificers, and the smiths, from Jerusalem;)
By the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan, and Gemariah, son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, into Babel) saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, to all the captivity, which I caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem into Babel:
Build ye houses and dwell; and plant gardens and eat their fruit:
Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and ye shall give your daughters to husbands, and they shall bring forth sons and daughters: and ye be increased there, and ye shall not be diminished.
And seek ye the peace of the city where I caused you to be carried away captive there, and pray for it to Jehovah; for in her peace, peace shall be to you.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Your prophets in the midst of you shall not deceive to you, and your diviners and you shall not hear to your dreams which ye dream.
For they are prophesying in falsehood to you in my name: I sent them not, says Jehovah.
For thus said Jehovah, That according to the filling up to Babel of seventy years I will review you and lift up to you my good word to turn you back to this place.
For I knew the purposes which I purposed concerning you, says Jehovah; purposes of peace, and not for evil, to give to you the last part and expectation.
And ye called me, and went and prayed to me, and I heard to you.
And ye sought me and found, for ye will seek me with all your heart.
And I was found to you, says Jehovah: and I turned back your captivity, and I gathered you from all the nations, and from all the places where I thrust you away there says Jehovah; and I turned you back to the place where I caused you to be carried away captive from thence.
For ye said Jehovah raised up to us prophets in Babel.
For thus said Jehovah to the king sitting upon the throne of David, and to all the people dwelling in this city, your brethren which went not forth with you into captivity.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, Behold me sending upon them the sword, the famine, and the death, and I gave them as evil figs which shall not be eaten from being evil.
And I pursued after them with the sword, with famine and with death, and I gave them for agitation to all the kingdoms of the earth, for a curse and for astonishment, and for hissing and for a reproach among all the nations which I thrust them away there:
For that they heard not to my word, says Jehovah, which I sent to them with my servants the prophets, rising early and sending; and ye heard not, says Jehovah.
And hear ye the word of Jehovah, all the captivity which I sent from Jerusalem into Babel.
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, to Ahab son of Kolaiah, and to Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, prophesying a lie to you in my name; Behold, I gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he struck them before your eyes;
And a curse was taken from them to all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah will set thee as Zedekiah, and as Ahab, whom the king of Babel roasted them in fire;
Because they did folly in Israel, and they will commit adultery with their neighbors' wives, and they will speak the word of a lie in my name, which I commanded them not; and I know, and a witness, says Jehovah.
And to Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shalt say, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saying, Because thou didst send writings as thy name to all the people which are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to the priests, saying,
Jehovah gave thee priest instead of Jehoida the priest to be overseers of the house of Jehovah, and for every man raving and prophesying, and give him to the stocks and to the prison.
And now wherefore didst thou not reprove with Jeremiah of Anathoth prophesying to you?
For, for this, he sent to us in Babel, saying, This is long: build ye houses, and inhabit; plant gardens, and eat their fruit.
And Zephaniah the priest will read this writing in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
Send to all the captivity, saying, Thus said Jehovah to Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he will cause you to trust in falsehood:
For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me reviewing upon Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: there shall not be to him a man in the midst of this people; and he shall not look upon the good I do to ray people, says Jehovah; for he spake turning away against Jehovah.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words which I spake to thee upon the writing.
For behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I turned back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said Jehovah: and I turned them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall inherit it.

For thus said Jehovah; We heard the voice of fear and of terror, and not of peace.
Ask ye now, and see if a male brought forth? wherefore did I see every man his hands upon his loins as she bringing forth, and all faces were turned to paleness?

And they served Jehovah their God, and David their king whom I will raise up to them.
And thou my servant Jacob shall not fear, says Jehovah, and thou Israel shalt not be dismayed: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back and rested, and was quiet, and none making afraid.
For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to serve thee: for I will make a completion to all nations where I scattered thee there, but with thee I will not make a completion: and I corrected thee for judgment, and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.
For thus said Jehovah, Thy breaking is incurable, and thy blow sickly.
None judging thy judgment for binding up: no healing will come up to thee.
All loving thee forgat thee; they will not seek thee; for I struck thee the blow of an enemy, the correction of the cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; thy sins were strong.
Why wilt thou cry for thy breaking? thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: thy sins were strong, I did these things to thee.
For this, all consuming thee shall be consumed; and all thine adversaries, all of them shall go into captivity; and they spoiling thee, were for spoiling, and all plundering thee I will give to plunder.
For I will bring up healing to thee, and I will heal thee of thy blows, says Jehovah: for they called to thee an outcast: This is Zion, none seeking for her.
Thus said Jehovah, Behold me turning back the captivity of Jacob's tents, and I will compassionate his habitations; and the city was built upon her hill, and the palace sat upon its judgment.

And his mighty one was from himself, and his ruler shall go forth from his midst; and I caused him to draw near, and he came near to me: for who this pledging his heart to approach to me? says Jehovah.
And ye were to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.
Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a cutting storm: it shall be hurled upon the head of the wicked.
The burning of the anger of Jehovah shall not turn, back till his doing, and till his setting up the thoughts of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall have understanding in it.
In that time, says Jehovah, I will be for God to all the families of Israel, and they shall be to me for a people.
Thus said Jehovah, The people escaped of the sword found grace in the desert; Israel going to cause him to rest.
Jehovah was seen to me from afar off; and I loved thee an eternal love: for this I drew thee in kindness.

For there is a day they watching upon mount Ephraim called, Arise ye, and we will go up to Zion to Jehovah our God.

Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old men together: and I turned their mourning to joy, and I comforted them and caused them to rejoice from their sorrow.
And I satiated the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah, A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping of bitterness; Rachel, weeping for her sons, refused to be comforted for her sons, for they are not.
Thus said Jehovah, Restrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for there is a reward to thy work, says Jehovah; and they turned back from the land of the enemy.
And there is hope to thy latter state, says Jehovah, and thy sons turned back to their bound.
Hearing, I heard Ephraim being thrust away: Thou didst correct me, and I shall be corrected as a calf not being taught: turn me back and I shall be turned back, for thou Jehovah my God.

Is Ephraim a precious son to me? if a child of delights? for whenever my speaking against him, remembering, I shall remember him yet; for this the bowels were put in motion to me compassionating, I will compassionate him, says Jehovah.

And in Judah shall dwell in it, and in all its cities together, husbandmen, and they removed with the flock.
For I satiated the weary soul, and every soul pining away I filled.
Upon this I awoke, and I shall see; and my sleep sweet to me.
Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I sowed the house of Israel and the house of Judah, the seed of man and the seed of beast.
And it was as I watched over them to pluck up and to break down, and to destroy and to cut off, and to break in pieces; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.
In those days they shall no more say, The fathers ate sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted.
But each shall die in his iniquity: every man eating the sour grape, his teeth shall become dull.
Behold the days coming, says Jehovah, and I cut out the house of Israel and the house of Judah a new covenant.
Not according to the covenant which I cut out with their fathers in the day I laid hold upon their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt; which they brake my covenant, and I was Lord over them, says Jehovah.
For this the covenant that I will cut out with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah; I gave my law in the midst of them, and upon their heart will I write it; and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.
And they shall teach no more a man his neighbor and a man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah: for they all shall know me to their small and even to their great, says Jehovah: for I will forgive their iniquity, and to their sin I will have no more remembrance.

The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year to Zedekiah king of Judah, this year the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar.
And then the strength of the king of Babel pressed upon Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the enclosure of the prison which was in the house of the king of Judah.
For Zedekiah king of Judah shut him up, saying, Wherefore prophesiest thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the king of Babel, and he took it.
And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for giving, he shall be given into the hand of the king of Babel, and speaking to him, his mouth with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes:
And he shall call Zedekiah to go to Babel, and he shall be there till my reviewing him, says Jehovah: if ye shall war with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.
And Jeremiah will say, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Behold, Hanameel son of Shallum thine uncle, coming to thee, saying, Buy to thee my field which is in Anathoth: for to thee the judgment of redemption today.
And Hanameel mine uncle's son will come to me according to the word of Jehovah, to the enclosure of the prison, and he will say to me, Buy now, my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin: for to thee judgment of possession, and to thee the redemption; buy to thee, and I shall know that this is the word of Jehovah.
And I shall buy the field of Hanameel son of mine uncle, which is in Anathoth; and I shall weigh to him seven shekels and ten of silver.
And I shall write in a book, and seal and affirm witnesses, and weigh the silver in the balances.
And I will take the book of the purchase, being sealed, the command and laws, and being unrolled:
And I shall give the writing of the purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel mine uncle, and before the eyes of the witnesses, writing in the book of the purchase before the eves of all the Jews sitting in the enclosure of the prison.
And I shall command Baruch before their eyes, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, take these writings, this writing of the purchase, and the sealed, and this writing unrolled, and give them into an earthern vessel, so that they shall stand many days.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet be bought in this land.
And I shall pray to Jehovah, after my giving the writing of the purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, saying,
Thou Lord Jehovah! behold thou madest the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine arm stretched forth; any word shall not be separated from thee.
Doing kindness to thousands and requiting the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them: The Great, The Strong God, Jehovah of armies his name.
Great of counsel, and vast of doing: for thine eyes being opened upon all the ways of the sons of men to give to each according to his ways, and to the fruit of his doings:
Who set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and in man; and thou wilt make to thee a name according to this day.
And thou wilt bring forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an arm stretched forth, and with great fear:
And thou wilt give to them this land which thou swarest to their fathers to give to them, a land flowing milk and honey.
And they will come in and possess it; and they heard not to thy voice, and they went not in thy law; all which thou didst command to them to do they did not, and thou wilt cause all this evil to befall them.
Behold the mounds, they came to the city to take it; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldees warring against it from the face of the sword, and the famine, and the death; and it was what thou spakest; and behold thee seeing.
And thou saidst to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy to thee the field for silver, and affirm witnesses; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
Behold, I am Jehovah, God of all flesh: is there any word separated from me?
For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he took it.
And the Chaldeans warring against this city came, and they burnt this city in fire, and they burnt it and the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to Baal, and they poured out libations to other gods to irritate me.
For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah were only doing evil in mine eyes from their youth: for the sons of Israel were only irritating me with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.
For this city was to me for mine anger and for my wrath, from the day which they built it and even to this day, to remove it from my face.
For all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to irritate me, they, their kings, their chiefs, their priests, and their prophets, and the man Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And they will turn to me the neck and not the face: and teaching them, and rising early and teaching, and they not hearing to receive instruction.
And they will set their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it.
And they will build the heights of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through to Molech, which I commanded them not; and it came not up upon my heart to do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.
And now for this, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to this city of which ye are saying, It was given into the hand of the king of Babel by sword and by famine, and by death.
Behold me gathering them from all the lands where I thrust them away there in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great anger; and I turned them back to this place, and I caused them to dwell with confidence.
And they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.
And I gave to them one heart and one way, to fear me all the days, for good to them and to their sons after them.
And I cut out to them an eternal covenant that I will not turn back from after them, to do them good; and I will give my fear in their heart not to turn away from me.
And I rejoiced over them to do them good, and I planted them in this land in truth with all my heart and with all my soul.
For thus said Jehovah, As I brought to this people all this great evil, so I bring upon them all the good which I speak concerning them.
And the field was purchased in in this land which ye are saying, It is a desolation without man and cattle; it was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
They shall buy fields with silver, and write thou in the book, and seal and affirm witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn back their captivity, says Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah the second time, and he yet shut up in the enclosure of the prison, saying,
Thus said Jehovah making it Jehovah forming it, to prepare it, Jehovah his name:
Call to me and I will answer thee, and I will announce to thee great and mighty things which thou knewest them not.
For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, being torn away to the mounds and to the sword;
Coming to war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of man whom I struck in mine anger and in my wrath, and that I hid my face from this city for all their wickedness.
Behold me bringing up to it health and healing, and healing them, and I uncovered to them the abundance of peace and truth.
And I turned back the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel and I built them as at the first.
And I cleansed them from all their iniquity which they sinned to me, and which they transgressed against me.
And it was to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for an honor to all the nations of the earth who shall hear all the good which I did them: and they trembled and were moved for all the good and for all the peace which I did to it.
Thus said Jehovah: Yet shall be heard in this place which ye were saying it was laid waste without man and without cattle, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, being desolate without man and without inhabitant, and without cattle,
The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying, Praise ye Jehovah of armies: for Jehovah is good, for his mercy is forever: of them bringing thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah; for I will turn back the captivity of the land as at the first, said Jehovah.
Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall be in this place being laid waste without man and without cattle, and in all its cities, the habitation of the shepherds causing the sheep to lie down.
In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the sheep yet pass through upon the hand of him numbering, said Jehovah.
Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up the good word which I spake to the house of Israel and for the house of Judah.
In those days and in that time I will cause the sprout of justice to spring up to David; and he did judgment and justice in the land.
In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell with confidence; and this is what shall be called to her: Jehovah our Justice.
For thus said Jehovah, I will not cut off to David a man sitting upon the throne of the house of Israel;
And to the priests, the Levites, I will not cut off a man from my face bringing up burnt-offerings, and burning the gift, and doing sacrifice all the days.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, If ye shall break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, and there was not day and night in their season;
Also my covenant shall be broken with David ray servant from there being to him a son reigning upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, from serving me.
As the army of the heavens shall not be numbered and the sand of the sea shall not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites serving me.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
Sawest thou not what this people spake, saying, The two families which Jehovah chose in them, and he will reject them? and they will despise my people from being yet a nation before them.
Thus said Jehovah, If not my covenant of the day and of the night, the laws of the heavens and the earth I set not up.
Also the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, will I reject from taking from his seed those ruling over the seed of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob for I will turn back their captivity, and I compassionated them.
The word that was to Jeremiah from Jehovah and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and all his strength, and all the kingdoms of the earth, the dominion of his hand, and all the peoples warring against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying.
Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Go and say to Zedekiah king of Judah, and say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the band of the king of Babel, and he burnt it with fire.
And thou shalt not escape from his hand, for being seized, thou shalt be seized and be given into his hand; and thine eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babel, and his mouth shall speak to thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babel.
But hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah, king of Judah: Thus said Jehovah concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:
In peace shalt thou die; and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee, thus shall they burn for thee; and, Alas, Lord they shall mourn for thee; for I spake the word, says Jehovah.
And Jeremiah the prophet will speak to Zedekiah king of Judah all these words in Jerusalem.
And the strength of the king of Babel warred against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah being left against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these remained of the cities of Judah, fortified cities.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah after king Zedekiah cut out a covenant with all the people which were in Jerusalem, to call to them liberty;
For a man to send away his servant, and a man his maid, the Hebrew or the Hebrewess, free; for a man not to serve with them with a Jew his brother.
And all the chiefs will hear, and all the people which came into the covenant, to send away a man his servant and a man his maid, free, no more to serve with them, and they will hear and will send away.
And they will turn back after this, and they will cause their servants and their maids to turn back whom they sent away free, and they subdued them for servants and for maids.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, I cut out a covenant with your fathers in the day of my bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, saying,
From the end of seven years ye shall send away a man his brother, the Hebrew who shall be sold to thee, and serving thee six years, and send him away free from thee; and your fathers heard not to me and inclined not their ear.
And ye will turn back today and do the straight in mine eyes, to call liberty a man to his neighbor; and ye will cut out a covenant before me in the house which my name was called upon it.
And ye will turn back and pollute my name, and ye will cause to turn back a man his servant and a man his maid, whom ye sent away free to their soul, and ye will subdue them to be to you for servants and for maids.
For this, thus said Jehovah, Ye heard not to me to call liberty, a man to his brother and a man to his neighbor behold me calling to you liberty, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the death and to the famine; and I gave you for agitation to all the kingdoms of the earth.
And I gave the men passing by my covenant who raised not up the words of the covenant which they cut out before me, the calf which they cut in two, and they will pass through between its parts.
The chiefs of Judah, and the chiefs of Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land passing between the parts of the calf.
And I gave them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking their soul; and their corpses were for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
And Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his chiefs, I will give into the hand of their enemies, and, into the hand of those seeking their soul, and into the hand of the army of the king of Babel going up from you.
Behold me commanding, says Jehovah; and I turned them back to this city, and they warred against it and took it, and burnt it in fire: and the cities of Judah will I give to desolation from none inhabiting.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak with them, and bring them to the house of Jehovah, to one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.
And I shall take Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazaniah and his brethren, and all his sons, and all the house of the Rechabites;
And I shall bring them to the house of Jehovah to the chamber of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was near the chamber of the chiefs, which was from above to the chamber of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, watching the threshold.
And I shall give before the sons of the house of the Rechabites, pots full of wine, and cups, and saying to them, Drink ye wine.
And they will say, We shall not drink wine: for Jonadab, son of Rechab our father, commanded to us, saying, Ye shall not drink wine, ye and your sons even to forever.
And ye shall not build a house, and ye shall not sow seed, and ye shall not plant a vineyard, and it shall not be, to you: for in tents shall ye dwell all your days, so that ye shall live many days upon the face of the earth where ye are strangers there.
And we will hear to the voice of Jonadab son of Rechab our father, for all which he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters;
Not to build houses for our dwelling; and vineyard and field and seed shall not be to us.

And it will be in the coming up of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, to the land, and we shall say, Come, and we will go to Jerusalem from the face of the army of the Chaldean, and from the face of the army of Aram, and we will dwell in Jerusalem.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Go and say to the man Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hear to my word? says Jehovah.
The words of Jonadab son of Rechab who commanded his sons not to drink wine, were raised up; and they drank not even to this clay, for they heard the command of their father: and spake to you, rising early and speaking; and ye heard not to me.
And I shall send to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Turn ye back now each from his evil way, and make good your doings, and ye shall not go after other gods to serve them, and turn ye back to the land which I gave to you and to your fathers: and ye inclined not your ear and ye heard not to me.
For the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab raised up the commands of their father which be commanded them; and this people heard not to me.
For this, thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing to Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the evil which I spake concerning them; because I spake to them and they heard not; and I shall call to them and they answered not.
And Jeremiah said to the house of the Reehabites, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Because that ye heard to the command of Jonadab your father, and ye will watch all his commands, and ye will do all which he commanded you:
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, A man shall not be cut off to Jonadab son of Rechab, to stand before my face all the days.
And it will be in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah king of Judah, this word being to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Take to thee a roll of writing, and write in it all the words which I spake to thee against Israel and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake to thee from the days of Josiah and even to this day.

And Jeremiah will call Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch will write from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah which he spake to him upon the roll of the book.

And go thou and read in the roll which thou wrotest from my mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in the house of Jehovah in the day of fasting: and also in the ears of all Judah coming from their cities thou shalt read them.
Perhaps their mercy will fall before the face of Jehovah, and they will turn back each from his evil way: for great the anger and the wrath which Jehovah spake against this people.
And Baruch son of Neriah will do according to all which Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, to read in the book the words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.
And it will be in the fifth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, they called a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people coming from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem.

And they will say to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears And Baruch will read in their ears.
And it will be when they heard all the words, they trembled, a man with his neighbor, and they will say to Baruch, Announcing, we will announce to the king all these words.
And they asked Baruch, saying, Announce now to us how thou didst write all these words from his mouth?
And Baruch will say to them, From his mouth he will read to me all these words, and I will write upon the book with ink.
And the chiefs will say to Baruch, Go hide, thou, and Jeremiah; and a man not knowing where ye are.
And they will come in to the king to the enclosure, and they deposited the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and they will announce all the words in the ears of the king.
And the king will send Jehudi to take the roll: and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi will read in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the chiefs standing from about the king.
And the king will sit in the winter house in the ninth month, and a furnace burning before him.
And it will be as Jehudi read three columns and four, he will rend it with the knife of the scribe, and cast into the fire which was in the furnace, even till all the roll was consumed upon the fire which was upon the furnace.
And they trembled not, and they rent not their garments, the king and all his servants hearing all these words.
And also Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah supplicated to the king not to burn the roll: and he heard to them not.
And the king commanded Jerahmeel, son of the king, and Seraiah, son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; and Jehovah will hide them.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah after the king burnt the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
Turn back, take to thee another roll, and write upon it all the former words which were upon the first roll which Jehoiakim king of Judah, burnt.
And to Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Thou didst burn this roll, saying, Wherefore didst thou write upon it, saying, Coining, the king of Babel shall come and destroy this land, and cause to cease from it man and cattle?
For this, thus said Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He sitting upon the throne of David shall not be to him, and his corpse shall be cast out to the heat in the day, and to the cold in the night.
And I reviewed upon him, and upon his seed, and upon his servants, their iniquity; and I brought upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah all the evil which I spake against them, and they heard not.
And Jeremiah took another roll, and he will give it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe; and he will write upon it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoialtim king of Judah burnt in the fire: and he added yet to them many words like them.
And king Zedekiah son of Josiah will reign instead of Coniah son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel made king in the land of Judah.

And the Chaldeans turned back and mimed against this city, and took hand burnt it with fire.

And Jeremiah will say, A falsehood; I fall not to the Chaldean: And he heard not to him: and Irijah will seize upon Jeremiah and he will bring him to the chiefs.

And Zedekiah will say to Jeremiah, No man shall know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
And if the chiefs shall hear that I spake with thee, and they came to thee, and said to thee, Announce now to us what thou spakest to the king; thou shalt not hide from us, and we will not put thee to death; and what said the king to thee:

Go and say to the king's servant the Cushite, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing my words to this city for evil and not for good; and they were in that day before thee.
And I delivered thee in that day, says Jehovah: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men thou wilt be afraid of their face.
For escaping, I will let thee escape, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, and thy soul was to thee for booty: for thou didst trust in me, says Jehovah.
The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah after Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks sent him from Ramah, in his taking him, he being bound in manacles in the midst of all the captivity of Jerusalem and Judah, being carried away captive to Babel.
And the chief of the cooks will take to Jeremiah and say to him, Jehovah thy God spake this evil against this place.
And Jehovah will bring and do as he spake: because ye sinned against Jehovah, and ye heard not to his voice, and this word was to you.
And now behold I loosed thee this day from the manacles which were upon thy hand. If good in thine eyes to go with me to Babel, come; and I will set mine eye upon thee: and if evil in thine eyes to go with me to Babel, desist: see all the land before thee: if good and for the straight in thine eyes to go, go.
And while he will not turn back, And turn back to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babel appointed over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people: or to all the straight in thine eyes to go, go. And the chief of the cooks: will give to him a portion and a gift, and he will send him away.
And Jeremiah will go to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpeh, and he will dwell with him in the midst of the people being left in the land.

And they will come to Gedaliah to Mizpeh, and Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan, sons of Kareah, and Seraiah, son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maachathite, they and their men.
And Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, will swear to them and to their men, saying, Ye shall not fear serving the Chaldeans: dwell in the land and serve the king of Babel, and it shall be well to you.
And I, behold me dwelling in Mizpeh to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us: and ye, gather ye Wine, and the fruit harvest, and oil, and put in your vessels, and dwell in your cities which ye took.
And also all the Jews which are in Moab, and among the sons of Ammon, and in Edom, and in the lands, heard that the king of Babel gave a remnant to Judah, and that he appointed over them Gedaliah son of Alukam, son of Shaphan.
And all the Jews from all the places where they were thrust out there will turn back, and they will come to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpeh, and they will gather wine and the fruit harvest exceeding much.
Johanan son of Kareah, and all the chiefs of the armies which were in the field came to Gedaliah to Mizpeh.
And they will say to him, Knowing, wilt thou know that Baalis, king of the sons of Ammon sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to strike thee in soul? And Gedaliah son of Ahikam believed not in them.
And Johanan son of Kareah said to Gedaliah in Mizpeh, in secret, saying, I will go now and strike Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know: wherefore shall he strike the soul, and all the Jews gathered to thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?
And Gedaliah son of Ahikam will say to Johanan son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this word, for thou speakest falsehood concerning Ishmael.
And it will be in the seventh month, came Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, from the seed of the kingdom, and the chiefs of the king, and ten men with him, to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, to Mizpeh, and there will they eat bread together in Mizpeh.
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah will rise, and the ten men which were with him, and they will strike Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, with the sword, and he will kill him whom the king of Babel appointed over the land.
And all the Jews which were with him with Gedaliah in Mizpeh, and the Chaldeans which were found there with the men of war, Ishmael smote.
And it will be in the second day of killing Gedaliah, and not a man knew.
And men will come from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Shomeron, eighty men, shaving the beard, and their garments rent, and cutting themselves, and a gift and frankincense in their hand, to bring to the house of Jehovah.
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah came forth to meet them from Mizpeh; he went going and weeping: and it will be as he fell in with them, and he will say to them, Come to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.
And it will be as they came to the midst of the city, Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, will slaughter them to the midst of the pit, he and the men that were with him.
And ten men were found among them, and they will say to Ishmael, Thou shalt not slay us: for there is to us treasures in the field, wheat and barley and oil and honey. And he will desist and kill them not in the midst of their brethren.
And the pit where Ishmael cast there all the corpses of the men whom he struck by the hand of Gedaliah was that which king Asa made from the face of Baasha king of Israel: Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the wounded.
And Ishmael will carry away captive all the remnant of the people which were in Mizpeh, the king's daughters and all the people being left in Mizpeh, which Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks committed to Gedaliah son of Ahikam: and Ishmael son of Nethaniah will carry them captive, and he will depart to pass over to the sons of Ammon.
And Johanan son of Kareah will hear, and all the chiefs of the armies which were with him, all the evil which Ishmael son of Nethaniah did.
And they will take all the men and go to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and they will find him at the many waters which are in the hill.
And it will be as all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah, and all the chiefs of the army which are with him, they will rejoice.
And all the people which Ishmael carried away captive from Mizpeh will turn about and turn back and go to Johanan son of Kareah.
And Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped with eight men from the face of Johanan, and he went to the sons of Ammon.
And Johanan son of Kareah will take, and all the captains of the armies which were with him, all the remnant whom he turned back from Ishmael son of Nethaniah from Mizpeh, after he struck Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the strong men of war, and the women and children, and the eunuchs which he turned back from the hill.
And they will go and dwell in the habitation of Chimham, which is near the house of bread, to go to come into Egypt,
From the face of the Chaldean: for they were afraid from their face, because Ishmael son of Nethaniah, struck Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babel appointed over the land.
And all the chiefs of the armies will draw near, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the small even to the great.
And they will say to Jeremiah the prophet, Now shall our supplication fall before thee, and pray thou for us to Jehovah thy God, for all this remnant; for we were left few from many as thine eyes see us.
And Jehovah thy God will announce to us the way which we shall go in it, and the word which we shall do.
And Jeremiah the prophet will say to them, I heard; behold me praying to Jehovah your God according to your words; and it was all the word that Jehovah shall answer you I will announce to you; I will not withhold a word from you.
And they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah will be with us for a witness of truth and faithful, if not according to all the words which Jehovah thy God will send thee to us, thus will we do.
If good, and if evil, we will hear to the voice of Jehovah our God which we sent thee to him; so that it shall be well to us, for we will hear to the voice of Jehovah our God.
And it will be from the end of ten days, and the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah.
And he will call to Johanan son of Kareah, and to all the chiefs of the armies which were with him, and to all the people, from small even to great,
And he will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, whom ye sent me to him for your supplication to fall before him.
If dwelling, ye will dwell in this land, and I built you, and I will not pull down, and I planted you, and I will not pluck up: for I grieved for the evil which I did to you.
Ye shall not fear from the face of the king of Babel whom ye fear; from his face ye shall not fear, says Jehovah: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you out of his hand.
And I will give mercies to you, and he compassionated you, and turned you back to your land.
And if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, not hearing to the voice of Jehovah your God,
Saying, No; for we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall not see war, and we shall not hear the voice of the trumpet, and for bread we shall not hunger: and there will we dwell.
And now for this, hear the word of Jehovah, ye remnant of Judah: Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, If setting, ye shall set your faces to go to Egypt, and ye went to sojourn there;
And it was the sword which ye were afraid of it, there it shall overtake you in the land of Egypt, and the famine which ye feared from it, shall cleave after you there in Egypt, and there shall ye die.
And it shall be all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to sojourn there shall die with the sword, and with famine, and with death: and there shall not be to them fleeing or escaping from the face of the evil which I bring upon them.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, as mine anger was poured out, and my wrath upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured out upon you in your going to Egypt: and ye were for a curse and for an astonishment and for reviling, and for reproach; and ye shall no more see this place.
Jehovah spake concerning you, Ye remnant of Judah, ye shall not go to Egypt: knowing, ye shall know, for I testified against you this day.
For ye erred in your souls when ye sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God; and according to all Jehovah will say, so announce to us, and we will do.
And I will announce to you this day; and ye heard not to the voice of Jehovah your God, and to all which he sent me to you.
And now knowing, ye shall know that by sword and by famine and by death ye shall die in the place where ye desired to go to sojourn there.
And it will be as Jeremiah finished speaking to all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, which Jehovah their God sent him to them all these words,
And Azariah son of Hoshaiah will say, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsehood: Jehovah our God sent thee not to say, Ye shall not go to Egypt to sojourn there:
For Baruch son of Neriah entices thee against us to give us into the hand of the Chaldeans, to kill us and carry us away captive to Babel.
And Johanan son of Kareah heard not, and all the chiefs of the armies, and all the people, to the voice of Jehovah, to dwell in the land of Judah.
And Johanan son of Kareah will take, and all the chiefs of the armies, all the remnant of Judah who turned back from all the nations, where they were thrust away there to sojourn in the land of Judah;
Men and women and children, and the king's daughters, and every soul which Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch, son of Neriah.
And they will come to the land of Egypt: for they heard not to the voice of Jehovah, and they will come even to Tahpanhes.
And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Take in thy hand great stones, and hide them in the mortar in the brick kiln, which is in the entrance of the house of Pharaoh in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah,
And say to them, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me sending and I took Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, my servant, and I set his throne from above these stones which I hid; and he spread his tapestry upon them.
And coming and smiting the land of Egypt, whom for death to death, and whom for captivity to captivity, and whom for the sword to the sword.
And I kindled a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he burnt them and carried them away captive: and he covered himself with the land of Egypt as the shepherd will cover himself with his garment; and he will go forth from thence in peace.

The word which was to Jeremiah to all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, dwelling in the tower, and in Tahpanhes, and Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Ye saw all the evil which I brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold them a Waste this day, and none dwelling in them;
From the face of their evil which they did to irritate me, going to burn incense to serve other gods whom they knew not, they, and your fathers.
And I will send to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Now ye shall not do this abomination which I hated.
And they heard not and inclined not their ear to turn back from their evil, not to burn incense to other gods.
And my wrath will be poured out, and mine anger, and it will be kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they shall be for a waste, for a desolation as this day.
And now, thus said Jehovah, God of armies, God of Israel: Wherefore ye do great evil to your souls to cut off to you man and woman and child and suckling from the midst of Judah, not to leave a remnant to you;
For your irritating me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye go to sojourn there, to cut off to you, and for your being for a curse and for a reproach in all the nations of the earth.
Forgat ye the evil of your fathers, and the evil of the kings of Judah, and the evil of their wives, and your evil, and the evil of your wives, which they did in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
And they were not humbled even to this day, and they feared not and they went not in my instructions and in my laws which I gave before you and before your fathers.
For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me setting my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.
And I took the remainder of Judah, that set their faces to go to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they were all consumed in the land of Egypt; they shall fall by the sword and by famine: they shall be consumed from small and even to great, by the sword and by famine: they shall die, and they were for an oath, and for a, desolation, and for a curse, and for a reproach.
And I reviewed over those dwelling in the land of Egypt, as I reviewed over Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine and by death.
And there shall not be escaping or fleeing to the remnant of Judah going to sojourn there in the land of Egypt, to turn back to the land of Judah, which they lift up their soul to turn back to dwell there: for they shall not turn back but the escaped.
And they will answer Jeremiah, all the men knowing that their wives burn incense to other gods, and all the women standing, a great convocation, and all the people dwelling in the land of Egypt in Pathros, saying,
The word which thou spakest to us in the name of Jehovah, we hear not to thee.
But doing, we will do all the word which went forth from our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, to pour out libations to her, as we did, we and our fathers, our kings and our chiefs in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we shall be filled with bread, and we shall be well, and see not evil.
From then we ceased to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her, we wanted all things, and were consumed by sword and by famine.
And when we burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and pour out libations to her, did we without our men make cakes to her, to serve her, and pour out libations to her?
And Jeremiah will say to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people answering him the word, saying,
The incense which ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your chiefs, and the people of the land, did not Jehovah remember them, and it will come up upon his heart?
And Jehovah shall no more be able to lift up from the face of the evil of your doings from the face of the abominations which ye did; and your land shall be for a waste, and for an astonishment, and for a curse, without any inhabitant, as this day.
From the face of what ye burned incense, and what ye sinned against Jehovah, and ye heard not to the voice of Jehovah, and in his instructions and in his laws and in his testimonies ye went not; for this, this evil befell you as this day.
And Jeremiah will say to all the people, and to all the women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all, Judah who are in the land of Egypt:
Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, saying, Ye and your wives, and ye will speak with your mouth, and with your hands ye filled up; saying, Doing, we will do our vows which we vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out libations to her: setting up, ye will set up your vows, and doing, ye will do your vows.
For this, hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah dwelling in the land of Egypt: Behold, I sware by my great name, said Jehovah, if my name shall yet be called by the mouth of all the men of Judah, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives, in all the land of Egypt.
Behold me watching over them for evil and not for good: and they were consumed, all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, by sword and by famine, even till their finishing.
And escaping the sword there shall turn back from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, men of number, and all the remnant of Judah going to the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall be raised up from me and from them.
And this a sign to you, says Jehovah, that I review upon you in this place, so that ye shall know that raising up, I will raise up my word against you for evil.

Thou saidst, Wo to me now! for Jehovah added grief upon my pain; I was weary in my sighing, and I found not rest.

Prepare the covering and the shield, and approach to the war.
Harness the horses, and come up, ye horsemen, and stand in the helmets; polish the spears, and put on the coats of mail.
Wherefore did I see them terrified, drawing back behind? and their strong ones shall be broken, and they fled a flight, and they turned not: fear being round about, says Jehovah.
The swift shall not flee away, and the strong shall not escape: to the north upon the hand of the river Phrath they stumbled and fell.
Who this as a river he shall come up, as the rivers his waters shall be moved?
Egypt as a river will come up, and as rivers the waters will be moved; and he will say, I will go up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and those dwelling in it.
Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and the strong ones shall come forth: Cush and Phut seizing the shield; and the Ludims, bending the bow.

Wherefore were thy powerful cast down, not to stand? for Jehovah thrust them away.

Against him bending shall he bending, bend the bow, and against him going up in his coat of mail: and ye shall not spare to her young men; exterminate all her army.
And the wounded fell in the land of the Chaldeans, and those being thrust through in her streets.
For Israel not in widowhood, and Judah from his God, from Jehovah of armies; if their land was filled with guilt because of the Holy One of Israel.
Flee from the midst of Babel and save ye each his soul: ye shall not be destroyed in her iniquity: for it is the time of vengeance to Jehovah; he will do to her a recompense.
Babel a cup of gold in the hand of Jehovah, making all the earth drunk: the nations drank from her wine; for this the nations will be foolish.
Babylon fell suddenly, and she will be broken: wail ye for her; take balsam for her pain, perhaps she will be healed.
We healed Babel, and she was not healed: forsake ye her and we will go each to his land: for her judgment reached to the heavens, and was lifted up even to the clouds.
Jehovah brought forth our justice: come ye, and we will recount in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.
Polish the arrows; fill the quivers: Jehovah roused up the spirit of the kings of the Males: for his purpose is against Babel, to destroy her; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.
Lift ye up a signal against the walls of Babel, strengthen the watch, set up the watchers, prepare the ambushes: for Jehovah also purposed and also did what he spake to the inhabitants of Babel.
Dwelling upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end came, the measure of thy plunder.
Jehovah of armies sware by his soul: That if I filled thee with men as with locusts, and they struck up a shout against thee.
He made the earth by his power, he prepared the habitable globe by his wisdom, and by his understanding he stretched forth the heavens.
For a voice he gives a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he will bring up the clouds, from the extremity of the earth, making lightnings to the rain, and he will bring forth the wind from his treasures.
Every man was brutish from knowledge; every founder was ashamed from his carved image: for his founding is a falsehood, and no spirit in them.
They are vanity, the work of delusions: in the time of reviewing they shall perish.
Not as these the portions of Jacob; for he the former of all: and the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of armies his name.
Thou a mallet to me, a weapon of war: and I broke the nations in pieces with thee, and I destroyed kingdoms with thee;
And I broke in pieces with thee the horse and his rider; and I broke in pieces with thee the chariot and its charioteer;
And I broke in pieces with thee man and woman; and I broke in pieces with thee the old man and the boy; and I broke in pieces with thee the young man and the virgin;
And I broke in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and I broke in pieces with thee the husbandman and his yoke; and I broke in pieces with thee the prefects and the rulers.
And I recompensed to Babel and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil which they did in Zion before your eyes, says Jehovah.
Behold me against thee, thou destroying mountain, says Jehovah, destroying all the earth: and I stretched out my hand upon thee, and I rolled thee from the rocks, and I gave thee for a burnt mountain.
And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, and a stone for foundations; for thou shalt be desolations forever, says Jehovah.
Lift up a signal in the earth, strike ye the trumpet in the nations, consecrate the nations against her, cause ye to be heard against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint over her a satrap; bring up the horse as the bristling locust.
Consecrate against her the nations, with the kings of the Medes, her prefects and all her rulers, and all the land of his dominion.
And the earth shall shake and be wearied; for the purpose of Jehovah was set up against Babel, to set the land of Babel for a desolation from not being inhabited.
The strong ones of Babel ceased to fight; they dwelt in fastnesses; their strength failed; they were for women: they burned her dwellings; her bars were broken.
A runner shall run to meet a runner, and he announcing, to meet him announcing, to announce to the king of Babel that his city was taken from the extremity.
And the passages were taken, and they burnt the ropes in fire, and the men of war trembled.
For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel: the daughter of Babel is as a threshing-floor, the time of her treading; yet a little while and the time of harvest coming to her.
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel consumed us, he destroyed us, he set us an empty vessel, he swallowed us down as a dragon, he filled his belly with my delicacies, he thrust us away.
My violence and my remainder upon Babel, shall she dwelling in Zion say; and my blood to the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
For this, thus said Jehovah: Behold me pleading thy cause, and I took vengeance with thy vengeance; and I dried up her sea, and made her fountains dry.
And Babel was for heaps, a habitation of jackals, an astonishment and a hissing, from none inhabiting.
Together as lions shall they roar: they shook themselves as the lion's whelps.
In their heat I will set their drinkings, and I made them drunken so that they shall exult, and sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rouse up, says Jehovah.
I will bring them down as lambs for the slaughter, as rams with he goats.
How was Sheshach taken and the praise of all the earth will be seized; how was Babel for a desolation among the nations!
The sea came up against Babel: with the multitude of rolling waves was she covered.
Her cities were for a desolation, a land of dryness and a sterile region, a land not a man dwells in them, and not the son of man shall pass through them.
And I reviewed over Bel in Babel, and brought forth his swallowing from his mouth: and the nations shall no more flow to him: also the wall of Babel fell.
Go ye out from her midst, my people, and save ye each his soul from the burning of the anger of Jehovah.
And lest your heart shall be faint and ye be afraid for the report being heard in the land; and a report came in a year, and after it in a year a report, and violence in the land, dominion against dominion.
For this, behold, the days coming and I reviewed upon the carved images of Babel: and all her land shall be ashamed, and all her wounded shall fall in her midst.
And the heavens and the earth shouted against Babel, and all which is in them: for those laying waste shall come against her from the north, says Jehovah.
Also Babel for the falling of the wounded of Israel, also for Babel fell the wounded of all the earth.
Being saved from the sword, go: ye shall not stand: remember from far off Jehovah, and Jerusalem shall come up upon your heart.
We were ashamed for we heard reproach: shame covered our faces, for strangers came to the holy places of the house of Jehovah.
For this, behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I reviewed upon her carved images: and in all her land the wounded shall groan.
If Babel shall go up to the heavens, and if she shall fortify the height of her strength, from me shall they laying waste come to her, says Jehovah.
The voice of a cry from Babel, and a great breaking from the land of the Chaldeans:
For Jehovah laid Babel waste, and he destroyed from her the great voice: and the billows roared as many waters, and a noise of their voice was given.
For he spoiling came upon her, upon Babel, and her strong ones were taken, their bow was broken: for the God of recompenses, Jehovah requiting will requite.
And I made drunk her chiefs and her wise, her prefects and her rulers, and her strong ones: and they shall sleep an eternal sleep, and they shall not rise up, says the King, Jehovah of armies his name.
Thus said Jehovah of armies: The broad walls of Babel being demolished, shall be demolished, and her high gates shall be burnt in fire; the peoples shall labor in vain, the nations for the fire, and they shall be weary.
The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, in his going with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babel, in the fourth year to his reigning. And Seraiah was chief of the resting place.
And Jeremiah will write all the evil which shall come to Babel, in one book, all these words being written against Babel.
And Jeremiah will say to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babel, and thou sawest, and didst read all these words,
And thou saidst, O Jehovah, thou spakest against this place, to cut it off, for none to be dwelling in it, to man and even to beast, for it shall be desolations forever.
And it was as thou finishedst to read this book, thou shalt bind upon it a stone and cast it into the midst of Phrath
And thou saidst, Thus shall Babel sink, and shall not rise from the face of the evil which I bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Even to this the words of Jeremiah.
The son of twenty and one years was Zedekiah in his reigning, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which Jehoiakim did.
For upon the anger of Jehovah it was in Jerusalem and Judah, till his casting them away from his face, and Zedekiah will rebel against the king of Babel.
And it will be in the ninth year to his reigning, in the tenth month, in the tenth to the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem and they will encamp against her, and a watchtower against her round about.
And the city will go into siege till the eleventh year to king Zedekiah.
In the fourth month, in the ninth to the month, and the famine will be strong in the city, and there was not bread for the people of the land.
And the city will be broken up, and all the men of war will flee and will go forth from the city by night, the way of the gate between the walls, which was by the king's garden; (and the Chaldeans upon the city round about:) and they will go the way of the sterile region.
And the army of the Chaldeans will pursue after the king, and they will overtake Zedekiah in the sterile regions of Jericho; and all his strength was scattered from him.
And they will seize the king and they will bring him up to the king of Babel to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he will speak judgment with him.
And the king of Babel will slaughter the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: and he slaughtered also all the chiefs of Judah in Riblah.
And he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babel will bind him with fetters and bring him to Babel and give him in the house of wards till the day of his death.
And in the fifth month, in the tenth to the month, this year the nineteenth year to king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, came Nebuzaradan, chief of the cooks, standing before the face of the king of Babel, into Jerusalem,
And he will burn the house of Jehovah, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt in fire:
And all the walls of Jerusalem round about, all the strength of the Chaldees which were with the chief of the cooks, brake down.
And from the weak of the people, and the rest of the people being left in the city, and those falling away which fell to the king of Babel, and the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried into exile.
And from the weak of the land, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks left for vine-dressers and for ploughmen.
And the pillars of brass which were to the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the sea of brass which was in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans brake in pieces, and they will lift up their brass to Babel.
And the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the vases and the dishes, and all the vessels of brass which they served in them, they took.
And the basins and the fire-pans and the vases and the pots and the chandeliers, and the dishes and the cups, which were of gold, gold, and which of silver, silver, the chief of the cooks took.
The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve oxen of brass which were under the bases, which king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah; there was no weight to their brass of all these vessels.
And the pillars, eighteen cubits the height of the one pillar; and a thread of twelve cubits will surround it; and its thickness four fingers: it was hollow.
And a capital upon it of brass; and the height of the one capital, five cubits, and the net and the pomegranates upon the capitals round about, all of brass. And according to these, to the second pillar and the pomegranates.
And the pomegranates were ninety and six a side; all the pomegranates a hundred upon the net round about.
And the chief of the cooks will take Seraiah the priest, the head, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three watchers of the threshold:
And from the city he took one eunuch who was appointed over the men of war; and seven men seeing the face of the king, who were found in the city; and the scribe of the chief of the army mustering the people of the land; and sixty men from the people of the land being found in the midst of the city.
And Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks, will take them, and will bring them to the king of Babel to Riblah.
And the king of Babel will strike them, and kill them in Riblah in the land of Hamath. And Judah will be carried into exile from his land.
This the people which Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and twenty and three.
In the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred thirty and two souls from Jerusalem:
In the three and twentieth year to Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan chief of the cooks carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five souls: all the souls four thousand and six hundred.
And it will be in the thirty and seventh year to the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty and fifth to the month, Evil Merodach, king of Babel, in the year of his reigning lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth from the house of the prison,
And he will speak with him good things, and he will give his throne from above to the throne of the kings which were with him in Babel,
And he changed the garment of his shutting up: and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life.
And his ration a ration continually, given to him from the king of Babel, the word of a day in its days, even to the day of his death, all the days of his life.
How sat the city alone being many in people she was as a widow: being many among the nations, being a leader in the provinces, she became for tribute.
Weeping, she will weep in the night, and her tears upon her cheeks: no comfort to her from all loving her: all her friends dealt faithlessly with her, they were to her for enemies.
Judah was carried away captive from affliction, and from the greatness of her serving: she dwelt in the nations, she found no rest: all pursuing her overtook her between straitnesses.
The ways of Zion mourn from none coming to the appointment: all her gates being desolated: her priests groaning, her virgins grieved, and it is bitterness to her.
Her adversaries were for head, her enemies were secure; for Jehovah afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children went into captivity before the face of him pressing.
From the daughter of Zion all her decoration went forth: her chiefs were as rams; they found not feed, and they went without strength before him pursuing.
Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and her wanderings, all her delights which were from the days of old in the falling of her people into the hand of the enemy, and none helping for her: the adversaries saw her; they laughed at her calamities.
Jerusalem sinned a sin; for this she was for a removing: all honoring her despised her, for they saw her nakedness: also she sighed, and she will turn away behind.
Her uncleanness is in her train; she remembered not her latter state; and she will come down wonderfully: none comforting for her. See, O Jehovah, my affliction: for the enemy magnified.
The adversary spread out his hand upon all her delights, for she saw the nations came in to her holy place, which thou didst command they shall not come in to the convocation to thee.
All her people sighing, seeking bread; they gave from their delights for food to turn back the soul: see, O Jehovah, and regard; for I was despised.
Nothing to you, all ye passing by the way? Behold, and see if there is pain as my pain, which was done to me with which Jehovah afflicted in the day of the burning of his anger.
From height he sent fire into my bones, and it brought them down: he spread a net for my feet, he turned me away behind: he gave me desolation, being sad all the day.
The yoke of my transgressions was bound by his hand: they will be woven together, they came up upon my neck: he caused my strength to fail, Jehovah gave me into the hands; I shall not be able to rise up.
Jehovah contemned all my mighty ones in my midst: he called an appointment upon me to break my chosen ones: Jehovah trod the wine-press to the virgin, the daughter of Judah.
For these I weep; mine eye, mine eye will go down with water, for he comforting turning back my soul, removed far off from me: my sons were desolations, for the enemy prevailed.
Zion spread forth her hands, none comforting for her: Jehovah commanded for Jacob, his adversaries round about him: Jerusalem was for uncleanness within them.
Jehovah he is just: for I embittered his mouth: hear now, all ye peoples, and see my pain: my virgins and my chosen ones went into captivity.
I called to those loving me, they deceived me: my priests and my old men expired in the city, for they sought food for them, and they will turn back their souls.
See, O Jehovah; for straits to me: my bowels were in a ferment; my heart turned in my midst; for embittering, I embittered: without, the sword bereaved; in the house, as death.
Hear, ye, for I groan: none comforting for me: all mine enemies heard my evils: they rejoiced that thou didst: thou broughtest the day thou didst call, and they shall be like me.
All their evil shall come before thee; and do evil to them according as thou didst evil to me for all my transgressions: for many my groanings, and any heart being sad.
How will Jehovah in his anger cover the daughter of Zion! he cast down from the heavens to the earth the beauty of Israel, and he remembered not the footstool of his feet in the day of his anger.
Jehovah swallowed up, not pitying, all the seats of Jacob: he pulled down in his wrath the fortresses of the daughter of Judah; he caused to touch to the earth: he defiled the kingdom and her chiefs.
He cut off in the burning of anger all the horn of Israel: he turned back his right hand from the face of the enemy, and he will consume against Jacob as a fire of flame devouring round about.
He bent his bow as an enemy: he set his right hand as an adversary, and be will slay all the delights of the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion: he poured his wrath as fire.
Jehovah was as an enemy: he swallowed up Israel, he swallowed up all her fortresses: he destroyed his fortifications, and he will multiply in the daughter of Judah sorrow and sighing.
And he will tear away as a garden his dwelling: he destroyed his appointment: Jehovah caused to forget the appointment in Zion, and the Sabbath, and he will despise in the wrath of his anger the king and the priest.
Jehovah rejected his altar, he abhorred his holy place, he shut up in the hand of the enemy the walls of her castles; they gave a voice in the house of Jehovah, as the day of the appointment.
Jehovah purposed to destroy the walls of the daughter of Zion: he stretched out a line, he turned not back his hand from swallowing down: and the entrenchment will mourn, and the wall; together they languished.
Her gates sank into the earth; he destroyed and broke her bars: her king and her chiefs among the nations: no law: also her prophets found not a vision from Jehovah.
They sat upon the earth; the old men of the daughter of Zion were silent; they brought up the dust upon their head: they girded on sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem brought down their head to the earth.
Mine eyes failed with tears, my bowels were in a ferment, my liver was poured out to the earth, upon the breaking of the daughter of my people; in the fainting of the child and suckling in the wide places of the city.
To their mothers will they say, Where the grain and wine? in their languishing as the wounded in the broad places of the city, in the pouring out of their soul into their mothers bosom.
What shall I testify for thee? What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, and comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for great as the sea thy breaking: who shall heal for thee?
Thy prophets saw for thee vanity and a foolish thing, and they uncovered not upon thine iniquity to turn back thy captivity; and they will see for thee burdens of falsehood and seductions.
All passing by the way clapped their hands at thee; they hissed, and they will nod their head at the daughter of Jerusalem: This the city, they will say; the complete splendor of joy to all the earth.
All thine enemies opened wide their mouth upon thee: they hissed and they will gnash the teeth: they said, We swallowed down: surely this the day we longed for; we found; we saw.
Jehovah did what he purposed; he completed his word which he commanded in days of old: he pulled down and he pitied not: and be will gladden the enemy over thee; he lifted up the horn of thine adversaries.
Their heart cried to Jehovah, O wall of the daughter of Zion, cause tears to go down as a torrent day and night thou shalt give no remission to thyself; the daughter of thine eye shall not be silent.
Arise, cry aloud in the night: at the head of the watches pour out thy heart as water before the face of Jehovah: lift up thy hands to him for the soul of thy young children fainting with hunger in the head of all the streets.
See, O Jehovah, and look to whom thou didst accomplish this Shall the women eat their fruit, the children borne upon the hands? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the holy place of Jehovah?
The youth and old man lay down upon the earth of the streets; my virgins and my young men fell by the sword; thou didst slay in the day of thine anger; thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.
Thou wilt call as the day of appointment my sojourning from round about, and in the day of the anger of Jehovah there was no escaping and surviving: those I bore upon my hands and brought up, the enemy finished.
I the man seeing affliction by the rod of his wrath.
He led me and he brought darkness and not light.
Surely he will turn back against me; he will turn his hand all the day.
He wasted away my flesh and my skin; he broke my bones.
He built against me, and he will surround with poison and distress.
He caused me to dwell in darknesses as the dead of old.
He walled about me and I shall not go forth: he loaded my brass.
Also when I shall exclaim and cry out, he stopped my prayer.
He walled up my ways with hewn stones, he made crooked my beaten paths.
He is to me a bear lying in wait, a lion in secret places.
He turned aside my ways and he will tear me in pieces: he set me a desolation.
He bent his bow, he will set me up as a mark for the arrow.
He brought the sons of his quiver into my reins.
I was a derision to all my people; their song all the day.
He filled me with bitternesses, he gave me wormwood to drink.
He will break my teeth with gravel stones, he covered me with ashes.
Thou wilt cast of my soul from peace: I forgat good.
And saying, My glory perished, and my hope from Jehovah:
Remembering my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the poison.
Remembering, my soul will remember, and will be bowed down upon me.
I will turn this back to my heart; for this I shall hope.
The mercies of Jehovah are that we were not consumed, for his compassions were not finished.
New for the mornings: great thy faithfulness.
Jehovah my portion, said my soul; for this I will hope toward him.
Good Jehovah to those waiting for him, to the soul that will seek him.
Good, and he shall wait and stand still for the salvation of Jehovah.
Good for a man that he shall lift up the yoke in his youth.
He will sit alone and be silent, for he laid upon him.
He will give his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there is hope.
He will give the cheek to him striking him: he will be filled with reproach.
For Jehovah will not cast of forever:
For if he afflicted, and he compassionated according to the multitude of his mercy.
For he afflicted not from his heart and grieved the sons of men,
To crush under his feet all the bound of the earth,
To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High.
To pervert a man in his contention Jehovah saw not.
Who this saying, And it shall be Jehovah commanding not?
From the mouth of the Most High shall not come forth evil and good.
Why shall a living man murmur? a man for his sin?
We will search out our ways, and examine and turn back even to Jehovah.
We will lift up our hearts upon the hands to God in the heavens.
We transgressed and resisted: thou forgavest not.
Thou didst cover with anger, and thou wilt pursue us: thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.
Thou didst cover over thyself with a cloud from a prayer passing through.
Thou didst set us the offscouring and despising in the midst of peoples.
All our enemies opened their mouth against us.
Fear and a snare were to us, desolation and breaking.
Mine eye will bring down streams of water for the breaking of the daughter of my people.
Mine eye flowed and it will not be silent, from no intermission,
Till Jehovah shall look forth and see from the heavens.
Mine eye will glean for my soul for all the daughters of my city.
Hunting, they hunted me as a bird, mine enemies, gratuitously.
They cut off my life in the pit, and cast a stone upon me.
Waters were spread over my head; I said I was cut off.
I called thy name, O Jehovah, in the pit underneath.
Thou heardest my voice: thou wilt not hide thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
Thou drewest near in the day I shall call thee: thou saidst, Thou shalt not fear.
Thou didst contend, O Jehovah, the contentions of my soul; thou didst redeem my life.
Thou sawest, O Jehovah, my bowing down: judge thou my judgment.
Thou sawest all their vengeance, all their purposes against me.
Thou heardest their reproach, O Jehovah, all their purposes against me.
The lips of those rising up, and their devices against me all the day.
Their sitting and their rising, look thou: I their song.
Thou wilt turn back to them a retribution, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
Thou wilt give to them a covering of heart, thy curse to them.
Thou wilt pursue in thine anger, and thou wilt destroy them from under the heavens, O Jehovah.
How will the gold become dim the good gold will be changed the stones of the holy place shall be poured out in the head of all the streets.
The precious sons of Zion being lifted up with fine gold, how they were reckoned for earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter.
Also the dragons draw out the breast, they suckled their sucklings: the daughter of my people violent as the ostriches in the desert.
The tongue of the suckling adhered to his palate in thirst: the young children asked for bread, none breaking bread to them.
They eating for dainties were desolate in the streets: they trusting upon scarlet embraced dung hills.
For the iniquity of the daughter of my people will be great above the sin of Sodom being overthrown as in a moment, and no hands waited for her.
Her consecrated ones were pure above snow, they were white above milk, they were red of body above pearls, their figure sapphire:
Their form dark above blackness; they were not known in the streets: their skin adhered to their bones; it was dried up, it was as wood.
Those wounded by the sword were good above those wounded by famine: these will flow away, being thrust through from the produce of the field.
The hands of compassionate women boiled their children: they were for food to them in the breaking of the daughter of my people.
Jehovah finished his wrath; he poured out the burning of his anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion, and it will devour her foundations.
The kings of the earth believed not, and all those dwelling in the habitable globe, that the enemy will come in to the gates of Jerusalem.
From the sins of her prophets the iniquities of her priests shedding the blood of the just in her midst,
The blind were shaken in the streets, they were stained with blood, so that they shall not be able to touch upon their garments.
Remove the unclean one, call to them; remove, remove, ye shall not touch: for they were laid waste; they were shaken, say ye, among the nations: they shall not add to sojourn.
The face of Jehovah their portion; he will not add to look upon them: they accepted not the face of the priests, they compassionated not the old men.
Continuing, yet our eyes will fail, for our help in vain: in our watching we watched for a nation it will not save us.
They hunted our steps from going in our broad places: our end drew near, our days were completed; for our end came.
They pursuing us were swift above the eagle of the heavens: they burned after us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the desert.
The spirit of our nostrils, the Messiah of Jehovah was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dwelling in the land of Uz; also upon thee shall the cup pass: thou shalt be drunken, and make thyself naked.
Thine iniquity was finished, O daughter of Zion; he will not add to carry thee into exile: reviewing thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he uncovered upon thy sins.
Remember, O Jehovah, what was to us: look and see our reproach.
Our inheritance was turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.
We were orphans, no father; our mothers as widows.
We drank our water for silver; our wood will come for a price.
Upon our necks were we pursued: we labored and no rest to us.
We gave the hand to Egypt, to Assur, to be filled with bread.
Our fathers sinned, they are not; we bore their iniquities.
Servants ruled over us: none delivering from their hand.
With our souls we shall bring our bread from the face of the sword of the desert.
Our skin was scorched as a furnace from the face of the violent heat of famine.
They humbled the women in Zion the virgins in the cities of Judah.
Chiefs were hung by their hand: the faces of old men were not honored.
They took away the chosen ones to grind, and the young men were weak in the wood.
Old men ceased from the gate, the chosen ones from their stringed instruments.
The joy of our heart ceased; our dance was turned to mourning.
The crown of our head fell: wo! now to us, for we sinned.
For this our heart was languid; for this our eyes were darkened.
For mount Zion was laid waste, the foxes went upon it.
Thou, O Jehovah, shalt dwell forever; thy throne to generation and generation.
Wherefore wilt thou forget us forever? wilt thou forsake us to length of days?
Turn us back, O Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
But rejecting, thou didst reject us; thou wert angry against us even greatly.
And it will be in the thirtieth year, in the fourth, in the fifth to the month, and I in the midst of the captivity by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened and I shall see visions of God.
In the fifth to the month, this the fifth year to the captivity of king Jehoiachin,
The word of Jehovah being, was to Jehezhel, son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldean by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah will be there upon him.
And I shall see, and behold, the spirit of a tempest came from the north, a great cloud, and a fire taking itself, and a shining to it round about, and from its midst as the appearance of burnished brass from the midst of the fire.
And from its midst the likeness of four living creatures: and this their vision; and the likeness of a man to them.
And four faces to one, and four wings to one, to them.
And their feet a straight foot; and the sole of their feet as the sole of a calf's foot; and sparkling as the appearance of polished brass.
And his hand of a man from under their wings upon their four sides; and their faces and their wings to these four.
And their wings joined every one to the other; they will not turn in their going, they will go each over against his face.
And the likeness of their face, the face of a man and the face of a lion, to the right, to these four: and the face of an ox from the left to these four; and the face of an eagle to these four.
And their faces: and their wings spread out from above; to each of the two being joined each, and two covering their bodies.
And they will go each over against his face; to where the spirit will be there to go, they will go; they will not turn in their going.
And the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance as burning coals of fire, as the appearance of flames going about between the living creatures; and a shining to the fire, and from the fire will go forth lightning.
And the living creatures ran and turned back as the appearance of lightning.
And I shall see the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, to his four faces.
The appearance of the wheels and their works as the appearance of topaz: and one likeness to these four: and their appearance and their works as a wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.
In their going they will go upon their four sides: they will not turn in their going.
And their backs, and the height to them, and terror to them; and their backs full of eyes round about to them four.
And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels will go by them: and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth the wheels will be lifted up.
To where the spirit will be there to go they will go, there the spirit to go; and the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.
In their going, they will go: and in their standing, they will stand; and in their being lifted up from the earth the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.
And the likeness upon the heads of the living creatures a firmament as the eye of the terrible crystal, stretched forth upon their heads from above.
And under the expansion their wings straight each to the other: to each, two, covering upon them, to each two covering to them their bodies.
And I shall hear the voice of their wings, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty in their going, the voice of speech, as the voice of a camp: in their standing, their wings will slacken.
And a voice will be from above to the expansion which was over their head; in their standing their wings will slacken.
And from above to the expansion which was over their head as the appearance of a sapphire stone: the likeness of a throne, and over the likeness of a throne, the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it from above.
And I shall see as the appearance of burnished brass, as the appearance of fire within to it round about, from the appearance of his loins and above, and from the appearance of his loins to below, I saw as the appearance of fire, and a shining to it round about.
As the appearance of the bow which will be in the cloud in the day of rain, so the appearance of the shining round about This the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And I shall see it and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall hear the voice of him speaking.
And he will say to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
And the spirit will come into me as he spake to me, and he will cause me to stand upon my feet, and I shall bear him speaking to me.
And he will say to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious nations who rebelled against me: they and their fathers transgressed against me even to this same day.
And the sons hard of face and strong of heart. I send thee to them; and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah.
And if they will hear, and if they will desist, (for they a house of contradiction,) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.
And thou son of man, thou shalt not be afraid of them, and thou shalt not be afraid of their words, if rebels and thorns with thee, and thou art dwelling with scorpions: thou shalt not be afraid of their words, and thou shalt not be terrified from their face, for they a house of contradiction.
And speak my word to them, if they will hear and if they will desist: for they are contradiction.
And thou son of man, hear what I speak to thee: Thou shalt not be contradiction as the house of contradiction: open thy mouth and eat what I give to thee.
And I shall see, and behold, a hand sent to me; and behold, in it a roll of a book.
And he will spread it out before me: and it was written the face and the back side: and written upon it lamentations, sighing, and Wo.
And he will say to me, Son of man, eat what thou shalt find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.
And I shall open my mouth, and he will cause me to eat this roll.
And he will say to me, Son of man, thou shalt cause thy belly to eat, and thou shalt fill thy bowels with this roll which I give to thee. And eating it, it will be in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
And he will say to me, Son of man, go; come to the house of Israel and speak my word to them.
For not to a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue; thou art sent to the house of Israel;
Not to many peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue which thou wilt not hear their words If to them I sent thee, they will hear to thee.
And the house of Israel will not hear to thee; for they are not willing to hear to me: for all the house of Israel are strong of forehead, and they are hard of heart.
Behold, I gave thy face strong over against their face, and thy forehead strong over against their forehead.
As the diamond strong above the rock I gave thy forehead: thou shalt not fear them, and thou shalt not be terrified from their face, for they are a house of contradiction.
And he will say to me, Son of man, all my words which I shall speak to thee take into thy heart, and with thine ears hear thou.
And go, come to the captivity, to the sons of my people, and speak to them, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah; if they will hear, and if they will desist.
And the spirit will lift me up, and I shall hear behind me a voice of a great shaking: Praised be the glory of Jehovah from his place.
And the voice of the wings of the living creatures, kissing one to the other, and the voice of the wheels over against them, and the voice of a great shaking.
And the spirit lifted me up, and it will take me and I shall go bitter, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
And I shall go to the captivity, the hill of the green ears, those dwelling at the river Chebar, and where they are sitting there, I shall sit there seven days, being astonished in the midst of them.
And it will be from the end of seven days, and the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, I gave thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and hear thou the word from my mouth, and admonish them from me.
In my saying to the unjust, Dying, thou shalt die; and thou admonished him not, and thou spakest not to admonish the unjust from his way of injustice to preserve him alive; this unjust one shall die in his iniquity, and his blood I will seek from thy hand.
And if thou hast admonished the unjust one, and he turned not back from his evil and from his way of injustice; he shall die in his iniquity and thou deliveredst thy soul.
And in the just turning back from his justice and doing evil, and I gave a stumbling-block before his face, he shall die: for thou didst not admonish him, in his sins he shall die, and his justice shall not be remembered which he did; and his blood will I seek from thy hand.
And if thou admonishedst the just for the just not to sin, and he sin not, living, he shall live, for he was admonished; and thou didst deliver thy soul.
And the hand of Jehovah will be there upon me; and he will say to me, Arise, go forth to the valley, and there I will speak with thee.
And I shall arise and go forth to the valley: and behold there the glory of Jehovah stood as the glory which saw by the river Chebar: and I shall fall upon my face.
And the spirit will come into me, and will cause me to stand upon my feet, and will speak with me, and my to me, Come in and be shut up in the midst of thy house.
And thou, son of man; behold, they gave bands upon thee, and they bound thee with them, and thou shalt not go forth in the midst of them:
And will cause thy tongue to cleave to thy palate, and thou wert dumb, and thou shalt not be to them for a man reproving: for they are a house of contradiction.
And in my speaking with thee I will open thy mouth, and say thou to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: He hearing, shall hear; and he desisting, shall desist: for they are a house of contradiction.
And thou son of man take to thee a brick, and give thou it before thee, and delineate upon it the city Jerusalem;
And give siege against it, and build a watch tower against it, and cast a mound against it, and give the camp against it, and set battering-rams against it round about.
And thou, take to thee an iron pan and give it a wall of iron between thee and between the city: and prepare thy face against it, and she was in siege, and press upon her. This a sign to the house of Israel.
And lie thou upon thy left side, and put the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: the number of days which thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt lift up their iniquity.
And I gave to thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days: and thou didst bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
And finishing these, and thou didst lie upon thy right side the second time, and thou didst bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day for a year, a day for a year I gave it to thee,
And to the siege of Jerusalem thou shalt prepare thy face, and thine arm being uncovered and prophesy against her.
And behold, I gave bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn from thy side to thy side, even to thy finishing the days of thy siege.
And thou, take to thee wheat, and barley, and the bean, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and give them into one vessel, and make them to thee for bread, the number of days which thou didst lie upon thy side; three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat it.
An thy food which thou shalt eat by weight, twenty shekels for a day: from time even to time shalt thou eat it.
And water by measure shalt thou drink, the sixth of the bin: from time even to time shalt thou drink.
And thou shalt eat it cakes of barley, and it shall be baked with dung coming forth of man, before their eyes.
And Jehovah will say, Like this shall the sons of Israel eat their defiled bread among the nations where I shall thrust them away there.
And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah behold, my soul not being defiled: and a carcass and the torn in pieces I ate not from my youth and even till now; there came not flesh of uncleanness into my mouth.
And he will say to me, See, I gave to thee the dung of oxen instead of man's dung, and make thy bread upon them.
And he will say to me, Son of man, behold me breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they ate bread by weight and with fear; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment.
So that they shall want bread and water, and they were astonished, a man and his brother, and they were melted in their iniquity.
And thou son of man, take to thee a sharp sword, the barber's razor, thou shalt take them to thee and cause to pass over thy head and over thy beard: and take to the balances of weighing and divide them.
Thou shalt burn the third in fire in the midst of the city, according to the filling up of the days of the siege: and taking the third thou shalt strike it with the sword round about it; and the third thou shalt scatter to the wind; and I will draw out the sword after them.
And take from thence a few in number and bind them in thy wings.
And thou shalt yet take from them and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in fire: from it shall come forth fire to all the house of Israel.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: this is Jerusalem; I set her in the midst of the nations and lands round about her.
And she will change my judgments for injustice more than the nations, and my laws more than the lands which are round about her: for they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they walked not in them.
For this, said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your tumult more than the nations which are round about you ye went not in my laws, and my judgments ye did not, and according to the judgments of the nations which are round about you ye did not.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me, me also, against thee, and I did judgments in the midst of thee before the eyes of the nations.
And I did in thee what I did not, and what I will no more do like, because of all thine abominations.
For this the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I did judgments in thee, and I scattered all thy remnant to every wind.
For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not because thou didst defile my holy place with all thine abominable things, and with all thine abominations, and I will also diminish; and mine eye shall not spare, and also I will not pity.
A third of thee in death shall die, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third shall fall by the sword round about thee; and the third I will scatter to every wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.
And mine anger was completed, and I caused my wrath to rest upon them, and I was comforted: and they shall know that I Jehovah spake in my zeal in my completing my wrath upon them.
And I will give thee for a waste, and for a reproach among the nations which are round about thee, before the eyes of all passing by.
And it was a reproach and reviling, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations which are round about thee, in my doing judgments in thee in anger and in wrath, and in reproofs of wrath. I Jehovah spake.
In my sending the evil arrows of famine upon them which were for destruction, which I shall send to destroy you: and I will add famine upon you, and I broke to you the staff of bread.
And I sent upon you famine and the evil beast, and it bereaved thee; and death and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I Jehovah spake.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face to the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the torrents and to the valleys: behold me, I bring the sword upon you, and I destroyed your heights.
And your altars were laid waste, and your images were broken: and I caused your wounded to fall before your blocks.
And I gave the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their blocks; and I scattered your bones round about your altars.
In all your dwellings the cities shalt be laid waste, and the heights shall be made desolate; so that your altars shall be laid waste and destroyed, and your blocks were broken and ceased, and your images were cut down, and your works were wiped away.
And the wounded fell in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
And I left in being to you them escaping the sword among the nations, in my scattering you in the lands.
And those escaping of you remembered me among the nations where they were carried captive there, because I was broken with their heart of a harlot, which turned away from me, and their eyes committing fornication after their blocks: and they loathed in their faces for the evils which they did for all their abominations.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah; not in vain spake I to do to them this evil.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the famine and by the sword and by death.
He being far off, in death shall he die; and he being near shall fall by the sword; and he remaining and he being besieged shall die by famine: and I finished my wrath upon them.
And ye knew that I am Jehovah in their wounded being in the midst of their blocks round about their altars, upon every high hill, upon all the heads of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they gave there an odor of sweetness to all their blocks.
And I stretched forth my hand upon them, and I gave the land a desolation and an astonishment from the desert of Diblath, in all their dwellings: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
And thou son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end, the end came upon the four corners of the land.
Now the end upon thee, and I sent mine anger against thee, and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.
And mine eye shall not spare upon thee, and I will not pity: for I will give thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: An evil, one evil, behold, coming.
An end came, the end came: it awaked against thee; behold, it came.
The circle came to thee, thou inhabiting the land: the time came, the day of consternation drew near, and not the shout of joy of the mountains.
The time drawing near I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I completed mine anger against thee: and I judged thee according to thy ways, and I gave upon thee all thine abominations.
And mine eye shall not spare, and I will not pity: I will give upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations, they shall be in the midst of thee; and ye knew that I am Jehovah striking.
Behold the day, behold, it came: the circle shall go forth; the rod blossomed, pride flourished.
Violence rose up for a rod of injustice: not from them, not from their multitude, and not from their confusion: and nothing eminent in them.
The time came, the day drew near: he buying shall not rejoice, and he selling, shall not mourn: for burning upon all her multitude.
For he selling shall not turn back to the sale, and it was in their yet living: for the vision for all her multitude; it shall not turn back, and a man shall not be strengthened in his iniquity of his life.
They shall strike upon the trumpet, and to prepare all; and none went to the war: for my burning is upon all her multitude.
The sword without, and the death and the famine from within: who is in the field shall die by the sword; and who is in the city, the famine and death shall consume him.
And they escaping, escaped, and they were on the mountains as doves of the valleys, all of them slain, a man for his iniquity.
All hands shall be relaxed, and all knees shall go into water.
And they girded on sackcloth and trembling covered them; and shame to all faces, and upon all heads, baldness.
They will cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be for uncleanness: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the outpouring of Jehovah: they shall not satisfy their souls, and they shall not fill their bowels: for it was the stumbling-block of their iniquity.
The matter of his ornament they set for pride; and they made the images of their abominations, their abominable things upon it: for this I gave it to them for uncleanness.
And I gave it into the hands of strangers for plunder, and to the unjust of the earth for a spoil; and they profaned it.
And I turned my face from them, and they profaned my secret; and the rapacious came into it and profaned it.
Make the chain: for the land was filled with judgment of bloods, and the city was filled with violence.
And I brought the evil ones of the nations, and they inherited their houses: and I caused the pride of the strong ones to cease, and their holy places were profaned.
And terror came, and they sought peace, and none.
And ruin upon ruin shall come, and report shall be to report; and they sought a vision from the prophet; and law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the old men.
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall put on desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble: from their way will I do with them, and with their judgments I will judge them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And it was in the sixth year, in the sixth, in the fifth to the month, I sitting in my house, and the old men of Judah sitting before me, and the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell there upon me.
And I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins and downward, tire; and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of burnished brass.
And he sent forth the likeness of a hand, and he took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and between the heavens, and it brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God, to the door of the gate within, looking to the north; where was there the seat of the image of jealousy possessing.
And behold there the glory of the God of Israel as the vision which I saw in the valley.
And he said to me, Son of man, lift up now thine eyes the way of the north. And I lifter up mine eyes the way of the north, and behold, from the north at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entrance.
And he said to me, Son of man, west thou what they are doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are doing here, to go far off from my holy place? And thou shalt yet turn back, thou shalt see great abominations.
And he brought me to the door of the enclosure, and I saw, and behold, one hole in the wall.
And he said to me, Son of man, break thou now, into the wall: and I broke through into the wall, and behold, one door.
And he said to me, Come and see the evil abominations which they are doing here.
And I came and saw, and behold, every form of creeping thing, and beast of abomination, and all the blocks of the house of Israel, delineated upon the wall round about, round about.
And seventy men from the old men of the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, stood in the midst of them, standing before them, and each his censer in his hand; and a rich cloud of incense went up.
And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man, what the old men of the house of Israel are doing in darkness, a man in the chambers of his images? for they are saying, Jehovah sees us not; Jehovah forsook the earth.
And he said to me, Thou shalt turn back yet; thou shalt see great abominations which they are doing.
And he brought me to the door of the gate of the house of Jehovah which was to, the north; and behold, there women sat weeping for Tammuz.
And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man? yet shalt thou turn back, thou shalt see abominations great above these.
And he brought me to the enclosure of the house of Jehovah within, and behold, a door of the temple of Jehovah, and between the porch and between the altar, about twenty and five men, their backs to the temple, and their faces to the east; and they worshiping the east to the sun.
And he said to me, Sawest, thou son of man? Was it light to the house of Judah doing the abominations which they did here? for they filled the land with violence, and they turned back to irritate me: and behold them sending the branch to their nose.
And also I will do in wrath: mine eye shall not spare and I will not pity: and they shall call in mine ear with a great voice, and I will not hear them.
And he will call in mine ears with a great voice, saying, Draw near, ye having oversight of the city, each the vessels of his destruction in his hand.
And behold, six men coming from the way of the highest gate which looking to the north, and each a weapon of smiting in pieces in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, an inkhorn of the scribe upon his loins: and they will come and stand by the altar of brass.
And the glory of the God of Israel came up from the cherub where he Was upon it, to the threshold of the house. And he will call to the man clothed with linen to whom the inkhorn of the scribe upon his loins.
And Jehovah will say to him, Pass through into the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and mark a mark upon the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning for all the abominations being done in her midst.
And to these he said in mine ears, Pass through into the city after him, and strike: your eye shall not spare, and ye shall not pity.
The old man, the young man, and the virgin, and little ones, and women, ye shall slay to destruction: and every man which upon him the mark, ye shall not touch; and ye shall begin from my holy place. And they will begin upon the old men which are before the house.
And he will say to them, Defile the house, and fill the enclosures with the wounded: go ye forth. And they went forth and struck in the city.
And it will be as they were striking them, and I being left, and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall cry, and saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah! destroyest thou all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring forth thy wrath upon Jerusalem?
And he will say to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah, great exceedingly, and the land will be filled with blood and the city being filled with wresting: for they said, Jehovah forsook the land, and Jehovah saw not.
And also I, mine eye shall not spare, and I will not pity, I gave their way upon their head.
And behold, the man clothed with linen to whom the inkhorn upon his loins, turning back word, saying, I did as thou didst command me.
And I shall see, and behold, to the which is over the head of the cherubs, as a stone of sapphire, as the vision of the likeness of a throne was seen over them.
And he will say to the man clothed with linen, and he will say, Go in between the wheel, underneath to the cherub, and fill thy fists with coals of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter over the city. And he will go in before mine eyes.
And the cherubs standing from the right to the house, in his going in, the man; and the cloud filled in the inner enclosure.
And the glory of Jehovah will rise from off the cherub over the threshold of the house, and the house will be filled with the cloud, and the enclosure was filled with the shining of the glory of Jehovah.
And the voice of the wings of the cherubs was heard, even to the enclosure without, as the voice to the Almighty in his speaking.
And it will be in his commanding the man clothed with linen, saying, Take the fire from between the wheel from between the cherubs; and he will go in and stand by the wheel.
And the cherub will stretch forth his hand from between the cherubs to the fire which is between the cherubs, and he will lift up and will give into the fists of him clothed with linen: and he will take and he went forth.
And there will be seen to the cherubs the form of a man's hand under their wings.
And I shall see, and behold, the four wheels by the cherubs, one wheel by the one cherub, and one wheel by the one cherub: and the vision of the wheels as the eye of a stone of topaz.
And their appearances one likeness to them four, as the wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.
In their going, upon their four sides they will go; they will not turn in their going, for to the place where the head will turn after it will they go; they will not turn in their going.
And all their flesh, and their back, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels being filled with eyes round about, the wheels to them four.
To the wheels to them was called, Gilgal! in mine ears.
And four faces to the one: the one face the face of the cherub, and the second face the face of a man, and the third, the face of a lion, and the fourth, the face of an eagle.
And the cherubs will be lifted up. This the living creature which I saw by the river Chebar.
And in the going of the cherubs, the wheels by them will go: and in the lifting up of the cherubs their wings to rise up from the earth, the wheels they also from beside them will not turn.
In their standing, they will stand: and in their rising, they will rise with them: for the spirit of life was in them:
And the glory of Jehovah went forth from off the threshold of the house, and it will stand over the cherubs.
And the cherubs will lift up their wings, and will rise from the earth before mine eyes: in their going forth and the wheels with them, and they will stand at the door of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah; and the glory of the God of Israel over them from above.
This the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I shall know that they are the cherubs.
Four, four faces to the one, and four wings to the one; and the likeness of the hands of a man under their wings.
And the likeness of their faces these faces which I saw upon the river Chebar, their appearance and themselves: they will go each over against his face.
And the spirit will lift me up and bring me to the east gate of the house of Jehovah looking to the east: and behold, in the door of the gate, twenty and five men; and I shall see in the midst of them Jaazaniah, son of Azur, and Pelatiah, son of Benaiah, chiefs of the people.
And he will say to say to me, Son of man, these the men purposing vanity and counseling evil counsel in this city.
Saying, It not being near; build houses: this the pot, and we the flesh.
For this, prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.
And the spirit of Jehovah will fall upon me, and he will say to me, Say, Thus said Jehovah; Thus ye said, O house of Israel: and the risings of your spirit, I knew it.
Ye multiplied your wounded in this city, and ye filled its streets with the wounded.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Your wounded which ye set in her midst, they the flesh, and this the pot: and I brought you forth from its midst.
Ye feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I brought you from its midst, and I gave you into the hand of strangers and I did judgment upon you.
By the sword shall ye fall upon the bound of Israel; I will judge you and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
This shall not be to you for a pot, and ye shall not be in the midst of her for flesh; upon the bound of Israel will I judge you.
And ye shall know That I am Jehovah: for in my laws ye went not, and my judgments ye did not; and according to the judgments of the nations round about you ye did.
And it will be as I prophesied, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, died. And I shall fall upon my face and cry with a great voice, and saying, Ah. Lord Jehovah, thou makest a completion with the remnant of Israel.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of thy kin, and all the house of Israel, wholly, which the inhabitants of Jerusalem said to them, Go ye far off from Jehovah; to us this land was given for a possession.
For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If I put them far off among the nations, and if I scattered them in the lands, and I will be to them for a little holy place in the lands where they went there.
For this, say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I gathered you from the peoples, and I collected you from the lands where ye were scattered among them, and I gave to you the land of Israel.
And they came there, and they took away all the abominable things, and all the abominations from thence.
And I gave to them one heart, and a new spirit I will give in the midst of you; and I turned away the heart of stone from their flesh, and I gave to them a heart of flesh:
That they shall walk in my laws, and they shall watch my judgments and do them, and they were to me for a people and I shall be to them for God.
And to the heart going to the heart of their abominable things and their abominations, I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the cherubs will lift up their wings, and the wheels with them; and the glory of the God of Israel over them from above.
And the glory of Jehovah will go up from the midst of the city, and stand upon the mountain which is from the east to the city.
And the spirit lifted me up, and it will bring me to Chaldea to the captivity, in a vision by the spirit of God. And the vision which I saw will go up from me.
And I shall speak to the captivity all the words of Jehovah which he caused me to see.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, thou art dwelling in the midst of a house of contradiction, which to them eyes to see, and they saw not: ears to them to hear, and they heard not: for they are a house of contradiction.
And thou Son of man, make to thee vessels of captivity and emigrate by day before their eyes; and emigrating from thy place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see if they are a house of contradiction.
And bring forth thy vessels as vessels of captivity by day, before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth in the evening before their eyes, as the goings forth of captivity.
Before their eyes break through to thee in the wall, and bring forth by it.
Before their eyes upon the shoulder thou shalt lift up, in thick darkness thou shalt bring forth: thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not see the earth: for I gave thee a wonder to the house of Israel.
And I shall do thus as I was commanded: I brought forth the vessels as vessels of captivity by day, and in the evening I broke through for me in the wall with the hand; in the thick darkness I brought forth, upon the shoulder I lifted up before their eyes.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the morning, saying,
Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of contradiction, say to thee, What doest thou?
Say to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: The ruler of this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel which they are in the midst of them.
Say, I am your wonder: as I did, so it shall be done to them: by emigrating, they shall go into captivity.
And the prince which is in the midst of them shall lift up upon the shoulder in thick darkness, and go forth: they shall break through into the wall to bring forth by it: he shall cover his face so that be shall not see the earth with the eye.
And I spread my net upon him, and he was taken in my net: and I brought him to Babel the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.
And all which are round about him to help, and all his hosts, I will scatter to every wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my scattering them in the nations; and I scattered them in the lands.
And I left of them men of number, from the sword and from famine, and from death, so that they shall recount all their abominations among the nations where they went there; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with trembling, and thou shalt drink thy water with disquiet and with dread;
And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to the land of Israel: they shall eat their bread with dread, and they shall drink their waters with astonishment, that her land shall be laid waste from her fulness from the violence of all dwelling in her.
And the cities being inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and they knew that I am Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, what this parable to you upon the land of Israel, saying, The days will be prolonged and every vision perished?
For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I caused this parable to cease, and they shall no more use it for a parable in Israel; but speak to them: The days drew near, and the word of every vision.
For no more shall there be any vain vision and smooth divination in the midst of the house of Israel.
For I am Jehovah: I will speak, what word I will speak and it shall be done; it shall no more be protracted: for in your days, O house of contradiction, I will speak the word, and I did it, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, behold the house of Israel saying, The vision which he saw is for many days, and for the times afar off he prophesied.
For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No more shall my words be protracted, for I will speak the word and it shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel prophesying, and say to them prophesying from their heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo upon the foolish prophets which are going after their spirit, and they saw not.
Thy prophets were as the foxes in the sterile regions, O Israel.
Ye went not up into the breaches, and ye will wall in the wall upon the house of Israel to stand in the war in the day of Jehovah.
They saw vanity and a divination of falsehood, saying, says Jehovah: and Jehovah sent them not: and they waited to raise up the word.
Saw ye not a vision of falsehood, and ye said, a divination of a lie, and saying, says Jehovah; and I spake not.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because ye spake falsehood and saw a lie, for this, behold me against you, said the Lord Jehovah.
And mine hand shall be upon the prophets seeing falsehood, and divining a lie: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, and they shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in; and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Because, and because they led my people astray, saying, Peace; and no peace; and he built a wall and they plastering it with plaster:
Say to them plastering with plaster: And it shall fall: there was a violent rain poured out; and ye, O hailstones, shall fall; and the spirit of storms shall rend.
And behold, the wall fell; shall it not be said to you, Where the plastering which ye plastered?
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I rent a spirit of storms in my wrath; and there shall be a violent shower overflowing in mine anger, and stones of hail in my wrath to finish.
And I broke in pieces the wall which ye plastered with plaster, and I caused it to touch the earth, and its foundation was uncovered and it fell, and ye were consumed in its midst: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
And I finished my wrath upon the wall, and upon those plastering it with plaster, and saying to you, No wall, and none plastering it;
The prophets of Israel prophesying to Jerusalem, and seeing for her a vision of peace, and no peace, says the Lord Jehovah.
And thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people prophesying from their heart, and prophesy thou against them.
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to them sewing together cushions for all the joints of the hands, and making cushions upon the head of every height to lie in wait for souls! will ye lie in wait for the souls to my people, and will ye preserve alive the souls to you?
Ye will profane me to my people for handfuls of barley and for morsels of bread, to kill the souls which shall not die, and to preserve alive the souls which shall not live, by your falsehood to my people hearing the falsehood?
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against your pillows with which ye lie in wait there for the souls to break forth, and I rent them from your arms, and I sent away the souls, the souls which ye lie in wait for to break forth.
And I rent your cushions and I delivered my people from your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand for being laid in wait for; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
Because ye afflicted the heart of the just one with falsehood, and I afflicted him not; and to strengthen the hands of the evil one not to turn back from his evil way, to preserve him alive.
For this, ye shall not see falsehood, and ye shall no more divine a divination: and I delivered my people from your hand: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
And there will come to me men from the old men of Israel, and sit before me.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, these men brought up their blocks upon their heart, and they gave the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: shall I be sought out, shall I be sought oat for them?
For this, speak to them and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: A man, a man of the house of Israel who shall bring up his blocks upon his heart, and shall set up the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet, I Jehovah answered to him coming according to the multitude of his blocks;
So that taking the house of Israel in their heart, which were all of them separated from me by their blocks.
For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Turn ye back, and turn away from your blocks; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
For a man, a man of the house of Israel, and of the stranger who shall sojourn in Israel, and he shall separate himself from after me, and shall bring up his blocks into his heart, and shall set the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and coming to the prophet to seek out to him for me; I Jehovah will answer to him for me:
And I gave my face against that man, and I set him for a sign and for parables, and I cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
And if the prophet shall be deceived, and he spake a word, I Jehovah deceived that prophet, and I stretched forth my hand upon him, and I destroyed him from the midst of my people Israel.
And they bare their iniquity; as the iniquity of him seeking so shall be the iniquity of the prophet;
So that the house of Israel shall no more wander from after me, and they shall no more be defiled with all their transgressions; and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, if a land shall sin against me to cover a transgression, and I stretched forth my hands upon it, and I broke to it the staff of bread, and sent famine upon it, and I cut off from it man and cattle:
And were these three men in its midst, Noah, Daniel, and Job, they by their justice shall deliver their souls, says the Lord Jehovah.
If I shall cause the evil beast to pass through upon the land, and it was bereaved, and there was desolation from not passing through from the face of the beast:
These three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if sons and if daughters they shall deliver; they alone shall be delivered, and the land shall be a desolation.
Or I shall bring a sword upon that land, and I said, Sword, thou shalt pass through the land; and I cut off from it man and cattle.
And these three men in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, they shall not deliver sons and daughters, for they alone shall be delivered.
Or I shall send death to that land, and I poured out my wrath upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and cattle.
And Noah, Daniel, and Job, in its midst, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if son if daughter they shall deliver; they by their justice shall deliver their soul.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Also if I sent my four evil judgments, sword and famine, and the evil beast, and death to Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and cattle?
And behold, there was left in it an escaping, sons and daughters being brought forth: behold them, they shall be brought forth to you, and ye saw their way and their doings: and ye were comforted concerning the evil which I brought upon Jerusalem, all which I brought upon her.
And they comforted you, for ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye know that not in vain did I do all which I did in her, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, what is the tree of the vine above every tree, the vine-shoot which was upon the trees of the forest.
Shall wood be taken from it to do for work? or will they take from it a peg to hang upon it any vessel?
Behold, it was given to the fire to consume; the fire consumed its two ends, and the midst of it was burned. Will it succeed for work.
Behold, in its being whole, it will not do for work: but if the fire consumed it, and it was burnt, did it yet do for work?
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the tree of the vine upon the tree of the forest which I gave it to the fire for consuming, thus I gave the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And I gave my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, and the fire shall consume them; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my setting my face against them.
And I gave the land a desolation, because they transgressed a transgression, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abomination,
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity from the land of the Canaanite; thy father the Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
And thy nativity, in the day thou wert born thy navel was not cut, and thou wert not washed in water for my looking upon; and salting, thou wert not salted, and swathing, thou wert not swathed.
No eye spared upon thee to do one of these to thee, to pity upon thee; and thou wilt be east to the face of the field in loathing of thy soul in the day of bringing thee forth.
And I shall pass by thee and see thee being trodden under foot in thy bloods, and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live; and saying to thee in thy bloods, Live.
I gave thee ten thousand as the sprout of the field, and thou shalt be multiplied and enlarged, and come into ornament of ornaments: the breasts were set, and thy hair sprang up, and thou wert naked and nakedness.
And I shall pass by thee and see thee, and behold, thy time the time of loves; and I shall spread my wing over thee and cover thy nakedness: and I shall swear to thee, and come into covenant with thee, says the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt be to me.
And I will wash thee in water, and I will wash thy bloods from off thee, and I will cover thee with oil.
And I will clothe thee with variegations, and shoe thee with tahash, and I will bind thee round with fine linen, and cover thee with silk.
And I shall deck thee with ornaments, and I shall give bracelets upon thy hands and a chain upon thy throat.
And I will give a ring upon thy nose, and earrings for thine ears, and a crown of glory upon thy head.
And thou shalt be decked with gold and silver, and thy clothing fine linen and silk, and variegation; fine flour and honey and oil thou didst eat; and thou wilt be fair, very exceedingly, and thou wilt prosper into a kingdom.
And a name went forth to thee among the nations in thy beauty: for it was perfected by my decoration which I put upon thee, says the Lord Jehovah
And thou wilt trust in thy beauty, and commit fornication upon thy name, and thou wilt pour out thy fornications upon every one passing by; to him it will be.
And thou wilt take from thy garments and make to thee heights being spotted, and thou wilt commit fornication upon them: thou earnest not in, and it shall not be.
And thou wilt take all thy ornaments from my gold and from my silver, which I gave to thee, and thou wilt make to thee images of a male and commit fornication with them.
And thou wilt take thy garments of variegations and cover them: and thou gavest mine oil and mine incense before them.
And my bread which I gave to thee, fine flour and oil and honey I gave thee to eat, and thou didst give it before them for an odor of sweetness: and it will be, says the Lord Jehovah.
And thou wilt take thy sons and thy daughters which thou didst bear to me, and thou wilt sacrifice them for these to eat From thy fornication is it small?
And thou wilt slaughter my sons and give them in causing them to pass through for them.
And with all thine abominations and thy fornications thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, in thy being naked and nakedness, and thou wert trod under foot in thy blood.
And it will be after all thine evil, Wo, wo to thee! says the Lord Jehovah.
Thou wilt build to thee a brothel, and thou wilt make to thee a height in every street.
At every head of the way thou didst build thy height, and thou wilt cause thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou wilt open wide thy feet to every one passing by, and thou wilt multiply thy fornication.
And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh: and thou wilt multiply thy fornications to irritate me.
And behold, I stretched forth my hand upon thee, and I will take away thy law, and I will give thee to the soul of those hating thee, the daughters of the rovers, being ashamed of thy way of wickedness.
And thou wilt commit fornication with the sons of Assur, from thy not being satisfied; and thou wilt commit fornication with them, and thou wert not satisfied.
And thou wilt multiply thy fornication at the land of Canaan with the Chaldeans, and also thou wert not satisfied with this,
How thy heart languished, says the Lord Jehovah, in thy doing all these, the work of a woman, an imperious harlot;
In thy building thy brothel in the head of every way, and thou madest thy height in every street; and thou wert not as a harlot to scorn a gift.
The wife committing adultery, instead of her husband she will take strangers.
To all committing fornication they will give liberal gifts: and thou gavest thy liberal gifts to all loving thee, and thou wilt make them a present to come in to thee from round about in thy fornications.
And it will be in thee the reverse from women in thy fornications, and none committing fornication after thee: and in thy giving liberal gifts, and none giving liberal gifts to thee; and thou wilt be for the reverse.
For this, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah:
Thus said the Lord Jehovah Because thy brass was poured out, and thy nakedness will be uncovered in thy fornications to those loving thee, and to all the blocks of thine abominations, and according to the bloods of thy sons which thou gavest to them;
For this, behold me gathering all those loving thee whom thou wert pleasant to them, and all whom thou lovedst, with all whom thou hatedst; and I gathered them against thee from round about, and I uncovered thy nakedness to them, and they saw all thy nakedness.
And I judged thee with judgments of those committing adultery and pouring out blood; and I gave thee blood of wrath and jealousy.
And I gave thee into their hand, and they pulled down thy brothel, and they broke down thy heights, and they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took all thy glory, and they left thee naked and nakedness.
And they brought up a convocation against thee, and they stoned thee with stone, and they cut thee in pieces with their swords.
And they burnt thy houses with fire, and they did judgments upon thee before the eyes of many women: and I caused thee to cease from a harlot, and also thou shalt no more give hire.
And I caused my wrath against thee to rest, and my jealousy departed from thee, and I will no more be irritated.
Because that thou didst not remember the days of thy youth, and thou wilt disquiet me in all these; and lo, I also gave thy way upon the head, says the Lord Jehovah: and thou didst not do wickedness upon all thine abominations.
Behold, all using parables will use a parable against thee, saying, As the mother, the daughter.
Thou thy mother's daughter loathing her husband and her sons; and thou the sister of thy sisters who loathed their husbands and their sons: your mother a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
Thine elder sister, Shomeron, she and her daughter dwelling upon thy left hand: and thy sister smaller than thou, dwelling from thy right hand, Sodom and her daughters.
And thou wentest not in their ways, and thou didst not their abominations: loathing as a little, and thou wilt be corrupted above them in all thy ways.
I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if Sodom thy sister did, she and her daughters, as thou didst, thou and thy daughters.
Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, security of rest was to her and to her daughters, and she strengthened not the hand of the poor and needy.
And they will be proud, and they will do abomination before me: and I shall take them away according to what I saw.
And Shomeron sinned not according to half thy sins: and thou wilt multiply thine abominations above them, and thou wilt justify thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou didst.
And thou also bear thy shame, who didst judge for thy sisters in thy sins which thou didst make abominable above them: they shall be justified more than thou: and also thou, be thou ashamed and bear thy shame in thy justifying thy sisters.
And I turned back their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Shomeron and her daughters, and the captivity of thy captivities in their midst:
So that thou shalt bear thy shame, and thou wert made ashamed of all which thou didst in thy comforting them.
And thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall turn back to their beginning, and Shomeron and her daughters shall turn back to their beginning, and thou and thy daughters shall turn back to your beginning.
And thy sister Sodom was not for a hearing in thy mouth in the day of thy pride.
Before thine evil shall be uncovered as the time of reproach of the daughters of Aram and all round about her, the daughters of the rovers despising thee from round about.
Thy wickedness and thine abominations, thou didst bear them, says Jehovah.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: And doing with thee according as thou didst who despised the oath to break the covenant.
And I remembered my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I set up to thee an eternal covenant.
And thou didst remember thy ways, and thou wert ashamed in thy receiving thy sisters great above thee, to the younger than thee: and I gave them to thee for daughters, and not from thy covenant.
And I set up my covenant with thee, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
So that thou shalt remember, and thou wert ashamed, and there shall no more be to thee an opening of the mouth from the face of thy shame in my expiating for thee for all which thou didst, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, propose an enigma and use a parable to the house of Israel;
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The great eagle great of wings, long of the wing-feather, full of feathers, which to him variegation, came to Lebanon, and he will take the foliage of the cedar.
He plucked off the head of the suckers, and he will bring it to the land of Canaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.
And he will take from the seed of the land, and he will give it in a field of seed; he took it to many waters, he set it a willow.
And it will spring up, and it will be for a spreading vine low of stature, for its branches turning towards him, and its roots will be under him: and it will be for a vine, and it will make branches, and it will send forth foliage.
And there will be one great eagle, great of wings, and many feathers: and behold, this vine turned her roots to him, and sent forth her branches to him, to water it from the ascendings of its planting.
In a good field by many waters it was planted, to make branches to bear fruit, to be for a great vine.
Say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Shall it prosper? shall he not pluck up its roots, and cut off its fruit, and dry up all the fresh foliage of its springing up? It shall be dried up, and not in its great strength, and by much people to lift it up from its roots.
And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? as the east wind strikes upon it? drying up, shall it not be dried up? it shall be dried up upon the risings of its springing up.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Say now to the house of contradiction, Knew ye not what are these? Say, Behold, the king of Babel coming to Jerusalem, and he will take her king and her chiefs, and bring them to him into Babel.
And he will take from the seed of the kingdom and cut out with him a covenant, and he will bring him in with an oath, and he took the mighty of the land:
To be a low kingdom, not to be lifted up, to watch his covenant to stand to it.
And he will rebel against him to send his messengers to Egypt, to give to him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he doing these, escape? and breaking the covenant, and escaping?
I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not in the place the king making him king which he despised his oath, and which he broke his covenant with him, in the midst of Babel he shall die.
And not with great strength and with a great convocation, shall Pharaoh do for him in the war by throwing up a mound and by building a watchtower to cut off many souls?
And he despised the oath to break the covenant, and behold, he gave his hand, and doing all these he shall not escape.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live, if not mine oath which he despised, and my covenant which he brake, and I gave it upon his head.
And I spread my net upon him and he was taken in my net, and I brought him to Babel, and I contended with him there for his transgression which he transgressed against me.
And all his flight with all his hosts, they shall fall by the sword, and they being left shall be dispersed to every wind: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I took from the foliage of the cedar, and I gave from the head; I will pluck its suckers a tender one, and I planted upon a mountain of height and heaped up.
In the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it: and it bare a branch, and it made fruit, and it was for a great cedar: and there dwelt under it all fowls of every wing; in the shadow of its branches shall they dwell.
And all the trees of the field knew that I Jehovah brought low the tree of height, made high the low tree, I dried up the green tree, and I caused the dry tree to flourish: I Jehovah spake and I did.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
What to you making use of this parable upon the land of Israel, saying, The fathers will eat sour grapes and the sons teeth will be blunted?
I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if it shall be to you more to use this parable in Israel.
Behold, all souls to me; behold, as the soul of the father, and so the soul of the son, they are to me. The soul sinning, it shall die.
And if a man shall be just and do judgment and justice,
Not to eat upon the mountains, and not to lift up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, and not to defile his neighbor's wife, and he shall not come near to a woman of uncleanness.
And he shall not oppress a man; he shall turn back his pledge to the debtor; he will not strip off plunder, his bread he will give to him hungry, and the naked he will cover with a garment;
And he shall not give upon interest, and he shall not take interest, from iniquity he shall turn back his hand; he shall do judgment of truth between man to man.
In my laws he shall go and he watched my judgments to do the truth; he is just; living, he shall live, says the Lord Jehovah.
And he begat a rapacious son, pouring out blood and doing the likeness of one of these.
And he doing not all these, but eating upon the mountains and defiling his neighbor's wife,
Oppressing the poor and needy, stripping off plunder, he will not turn back the pledge, and he lifted up his eyes to the blocks, doing abomination,
Giving upon interest, and taking interest: and living, he shall not live: doing all these abominations, dying, he shall die; his bloods shall be upon him.
And behold, he begat a son, and he will see all his father's sins which he did, and he will see and will not do like them;
Not eating upon the mountains, and not lifting up his eyes to the blocks of the house of Israel, not defiling his neighbor's wife,
And not oppressing a man, not binding the pledge, and not stripping off plunder, giving his bread to him hungry, and clothing the naked with a garment.
Turning back his hand from the poor, taking not usury and interest, doing my judgment, going in my laws; he shall not die in the iniquity of his father; living, he shall live.
His father because oppressing, he oppressed, stripping off, he stripped off the brother, and he did not good in the midst of my people, and behold him dying in his iniquity.
And ye said, Why bore not the son upon the iniquity of the father? and the son doing judgment and justice, watching all my laws, and he will do them; living, he shall live.
The soul sinning, it shall die. The son shall not bear for the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear for the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just one shall be upon him, and the injustice of the unjust one shall be upon him.
And if the unjust one shall turn back from all his sins which he did, and he watched all my laws and did judgment and justice; living, he shall live; he shall not die.
All his transgressions which he did shall not be remembered to him: in his justice which he did he shall live.
Delighting, shall I delight in the death of the unjust one? says the Lord Jehovah: not in his turning back from his way and living?
And in the just turning back from his justice, and doing iniquity according to all the abominations which the unjust one did, will he do and live? all his justices which he did shall not be remembered: in his transgression which he transgressed and in his sins which he sinned, in them he shall die.
And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Hear ye now, O house of Israel; shall not my way make even? shall not your ways make hot even?
In the turning back of the just one from his justice, and doing iniquity and dying in them; in his iniquity which he did he shall die.
And in the unjust one turning back from his injustice which he did; and he will do judgment and justice, he shall save his soul alive.
And he will see and turn back from all his transgressions which he did, living, he shall live; he shall not die.
And the house of Israel said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. Will not my ways make even, O house of Israel, shall not your way not make even?
For this I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah: Turn back and withdraw from all your transgressions; and iniquity shall not be to you for a stumbling block.
Cast away from you all your transgressions which ye transgressed against me, and make to you a new heart and a new spirit: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?
For I shall not delight in the death of him dying, says the Lord Jehovah: and turn ye back and live.
And thou, lift thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
And say, What thy mother? a lioness: between lions she lay down, in the midst of young lions she brought up her whelps.
And she will bring up one of her whelps: it was a young lion, and it will learn to rend the prey eating man.
And the nations will hear concerning him; in their pit he was taken, and they will bring him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
And she will see that waiting her hope perished, and she will take one of her whelps setting him a young lion.
And he will go about in the midst of the lions; he was a young lion, and he will learn to tear in pieces the prey, eating man.
And he knew their palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land will be desolate and its fulness from the voice of his roaring.
And the nations will give against him round about from the provinces, and they will spread their net upon him, being taken in their pit.
And they will give him in a prison with hooks, and they will bring him to the king of Babel: they will bring him into fastnesses so that his voice shall no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
Thy mother as a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and covered from much water.
And there will be to her rods of strength to the rods of those ruling, and his stature will be lifted up between the thick boughs, and he will be seen in his height from the multitude of his branches.
And she shall be plucked up in wrath, she was cast down to the earth, and the wind of the east dried up her fruit: the rods of her strength were broken and dried up, and the fire consumed them.
And now being planted in the desert, in a land of dryness and thirst.
And a fire will go forth from a rod of her branches; it consumed her fruit, and there was not in her a rod of strength, a rod to rule. It is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.
And it will be in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth to the month, men from the old men of Israel came to seek Jehovah, and they sat before my face.
And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, speak to the old men of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come ye to seek me? I live, if I will be sought for you, says the Lord Jehovah.
Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:
And say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of my choosing upon Israel, and I will lift up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and I will be known to them in the land of Egypt, and I will lift up my hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;
In that day I lifted up my hand to them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt to the land which I spied out for them flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands:
And saying to them, Cast ye away each the abominations of his eyes, an ye shall not be defiled with the blocks of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
And they will rebel against me, and they would not hear to me: they cast not away each the abominations of their eyes, and they forsook not the blocks of Egypt: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them, to complete mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
And I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which they were in the midst of them, which I was made known to them before their eyes to bring them forth from the land of Egypt.
And I shall cause, them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and I shall bring them to the desert.
And I shall give to them my laws, and my judgments I caused them to know, which a man shall do them and he lived in them.
And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be for a sign between me and between them, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating them.
And the house of Israel will rebel against me fit the desert: in my laws they went not, and my judgments they rejected, which a man shall do them and he lived in them: and my Sabbaths they profaned greatly and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them in the desert to finish them.
And I shall do for sake of my name, that it was not polluted before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.
And also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, not to bring them in to the land which I gave flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands.
Because they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they went not in them, and my Sabbaths they profaned: for their heart went after their blocks.
And mine eye will spare for them from destroying them, and I made not a completion with them in the desert.
And saying to their sons in the desert Ye shall not go in the laws of your fathers, and their judgments ye shall not watch, and with their blocks ye shall not be defiled.
I am Jehovah your God; go ye in my: laws, and watch ye my judgments and do them.
And consecrate my Sabbaths; and they were for a sign between me and between you to know that I am Jehovah your God.
And their sons will rebel against me: they went not in my laws, and my judgments they watched not to do them, which a man shall do them and live in them: my Sabbaths they profaned: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them to complete mine anger against them in the desert.
And I turned back my hand; and I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.
Also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, to scatter them in the nations, to disperse them is the lands.
Because they did not my judgments, and my laws they rejected, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after their fathers blocks.
And also I gave to them laws not good, and judgments they shall not live in them.
And I will defile them in their gifts in causing to pass through all bursting open the womb, so that I shall make them desolate, that they shall know that I am Jehovah.
For this, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers reviled me, in their transgressing a transgression against me.
And I shall bring them to the land which I lifted up my hand to give, it to them, and they will see every high hill and every thick tree, and they will sacrifice there their sacrifices, and they will give there the provocation of their oblation, and they will set there the odor of their sweetnesses, and they will pour out there their libations:
And saying to them, What the height where ye go there? And its name will be called Height, even to this day.
For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Are ye defiled in the way of your fathers? and commit ye fornication after their abominations?
And in lifting up your gifts, in causing your sons to pass into the fire ye are defiled for all your blocks, even to this day: and shall I be sought for you, O house of Israel? I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I will be sought by you.
And the things were coming up upon your spirit which will not be which ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone.
I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath poured out, will I reign over you.
And I brought you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them, with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath panted out.
And I brought you into the desert of the peoples, and I judged you there face to face.
As I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so will I contend with you, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I caused you to pass under the rod I brought you into the bond of the covenant.
And I separated from you the rebellious and those transgressing against me: I will bring them forth from the land of their sojournings, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
And ye, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go serve ye each his blocks, and afterward if ye bear not to me and ye shall not profane my holy name yet with your gifts and with your blocks.
For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, all in the land: there I will receive them into favor, and there I will seek your offerings and the chief of your liftings up, with all your holy things.
With the odor of sweetness I will receive you into favor in my bringing you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them; and I was consecrated in you before the eyes of the nations.
And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my bringing you into the land of Israel, to the land which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.
And ye remembered there your ways, and all your works which ye were defiled in them; and ye shall be wearied in your faces for all your evils which ye did.
And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my doing with you for sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face the way of the south, and drop to the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.
And say to the forest of the south, Hear thou the word of Jehovah; thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me kindling a fire in thee, and it consumed in thee every green tree and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north were burned in it.
And all flesh saw that I Jehovah kindled it: it shall not be quenched.
And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say to me, Does he not use parables?
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face to Jerusalem, and drop to the holy places, and prophesy to the land of Israel;
And say to the land of Israel, Thus said Jehovah: behold me against thee, and I brought forth my sword from its sheath, and I cut off from thee the just and the unjust.
Because that I cut off from thee the just and the unjust, for this my sword shall go forth from its sheath against all flesh, from south to north.
And all flesh knew that I Jehovah brought forth my sword from its sheath: it shall no more turn back.
And thou son of man, sigh with the breaking of the loins; and with bitterness thou shalt sigh before their eyes.
And it was when they shall say to thee, For what sighest thou? and say, For the report, because it came: and every heart melted and all hands were relaxed, and every spirit was weak, and all knees shall go into water: behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said Jehovah: say, A sword, a sword was sharpened, and also polished.
In order to slaughter a slaughter it was sharpened; in order for lightning to be to it, it was polished; then shall we exult? the rod of my son despised, every tree.
And he will give it to be polished, to be taken in the hand: this sword was sharpened, and it was polished to give it into the hand of him slaying.
Cry and wail, son of man, for it was upon my people, it was upon all the princes of Israel: terrors for the sword were upon my people: for this, strike upon thy thigh.
For it is a trial, and what if also the rod was rejected? it shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.
And thou, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand, and thou shalt double the sword the third time, the sword of the wounded: this the sword of the great wounded besieging them.
In order to melt the heart and to multiply the ruins, I gave the turning of the sword against all their gates: Ah! it was made for lightnings, it was polished for slaughter.
Unite thyself to the right, set thyself to the left, where thy face wavers.
And I also will strike my hand to my hand, and I caused my wrath to cease: I Jehovah spake.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
And thou son of man, set to thee two ways for the sword of the king of Babel to come: from one land shall come forth they two, and form thou a hand, form upon the head of the way of the city.
Thou shalt set the way for the sword to come to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
For the king of Babel stood at the mother of the way in the head of the two ways, to divine a divination; he shook with the arrows, he asked in the family gods, he looked in the liver.
In his right hand was the divination of Jerusalem, to set battering-rams, to open the mouth in breaking in pieces, to lift up the voice with a loud noise, to set battering-rams against the gates, to throw up a mound, to build a watch-tower.
And it was to them as a divination of falsehood in their eyes, swearing an oath to them, remembering iniquity to be taken.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of your causing your iniquity to be remembered, in your transgressions being uncovered, for your sins to be seen in all your works; because of your causing to be remembered, ye shall be taken in hand.
And thou profane unjust prince of Israel, to whom his day came in the time of iniquity the end.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Remove the tiara, and lift up the crown: this not thus: lift up the low, and make low the high.
Perverted, perverted, perverted, will I set her: and this was not till he came which to him the judgment; and I gave him.
And thou son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the sons of Ammon, and for their reproach; and say, The sword, the sword was loosed: for slaughter it was polished, to consume for sake of the lightning:
In seeing vanity to thee, in divining to thee a lie to give thee, to the necks of the wounded of the unjust, to whom their day came in the time of iniquity the end.
Turn back; thou shalt not be naked: in the place where thou wert created, in the land of thy nativity, will I judge thee.
I poured out my wrath upon thee; in fire I made mine anger to pass over thee, and I gave thee into the hand of brutish men, machinating destruction.
Thou shalt be to the fire for consuming; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt not be remembered: for I Jehovah spake.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of bloods, and make her to know all her abominations?
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city poured out blood in the midst of her, for her time to come; and she made blocks for herself to be defiled.
In thy blood which thou didst pour out thou went guilty; and by thy blocks which thou didst make thou wert defiled; and thou wilt cause thy days to draw near, and thou wilt come even to thy years: for this, I gave thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all the lands.
Those being near and those being far off from thee will scoff at thee; thou wert defiled of name and much in consternation.
Behold, the princes of Israel they were a man to his arm to pour out blood in thee.
They made light of father and mother in thee: they did with violence to the stranger in the midst of thee: they oppressed the orphan and the widow in thee.
Thou didst despise my holy place, and thou didst profane my Sabbaths.
Men of slander were in thee to pour forth blood: and they ate upon the mountains in thee: they did wickedness in the midst of thee.
Thy father's nakedness was uncovered in thee: they humbled her set apart for uncleanness in thee.
And a man did abomination with his neighbor's wife; and a man defiled his daughter-in-law in wickedness; and a man humbled his sister, his father's daughter, in thee.
They took a gift in thee to pour out blood; thou tookest usury and interest, and thou wilt plunder thy neighbors by violence, and thou didst forget me, says the Lord Jehovah.
And behold, I struck my hand at thy plunder which thou madest, and at thy blood which was in the midst of thee.
Will thy heart stand, or will thine hands be strong for the day which I do with thee? I Jehovah spoke, and I did.
And I scattered thee in the nations, and I dispersed thee in the lands, and I consumed thy uncleanness out of thee.
And thou didst inherit in thee before the eyes of the nations, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, the house of Israel became to me for dross: all they brass and alloy, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they were drosses of silver.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: because all of them were for drosses, for this, behold me gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.
The gathering silver and brass and iron and lead and alloy to the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it, to melt; so will I gather in mine anger and in my wrath, and I put down and melted you.
And I gathered you and blew upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye were melted in her midst.
As silver being melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in her midst; And ye knew that I Jehovah poured out my wrath upon you.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, say to her, Thou a land not being cleansed; it was not rained upon in the day of anger.
A conspiracy of her prophets in her midst as a roaring lion rending the prey; they consumed the soul; they will take the wealth and the precious thing; they multiplied her widows in her midst.
Her priests did violence to my law, and they will profane my holy place: between the holy to the profane they separated not, and they did not make known between the unclean to the clean, and from my Sabbath they hid their eyes, and I shall be profaned in the midst of them.
Her chiefs in her midst as wolves rending the prey, to pour out blood, to destroy souls, for the sake of plundering plunder.
And her prophets plastered plaster upon them, seeing vanity, and divining to them falsehood, saying Thus said the Lord Jehovah; and Jehovah spoke not.
The people of the land oppressed with violence and stripped off robbery, and oppressed the poor and needy, and did violence to the stranger without judgment.
And I sought from them a man to wall in the wall, and to stand in the breach before my face for the land, not to destroy it: and I found not.
I will pour out my wrath upon them; I consumed them in the fire of mine anger: I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.
The word of Jehovah will come to me, saying,
Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:
And they will commit fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committal fornication: there were their breasts pressed, and the breasts of their virginity fell away.
And their names Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; and they will be to me, and they will bring forth sons and daughters, and their names Shomeron-Aholah and Jerusalem Aholibah.
And Aholah will commit fornication under me; and she will desire after those loving her, after Assur, they being near.
Putting on cerulean purple, prefects and governors, young men of desire all of them, horsemen riding horses.
And she will give her whoredoms upon them from the choice of the sons of Assur all of them, and with all whom she desired; being defiled with all their blocks.
And her fornications from Egypt she forsook not: for they lay with her in her youth, and they handled the breasts of her virginity, and they will pour forth her fornications upon her.
For this I delivered her into the hand of those loving her, into the hand of the sons of Assur whom she desired after them.
They uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters and slew them with the sword: and she will be a name to women, and they did judgments upon her.
And her sister Aholibah will see, and she will corrupt her love more than they, and her fornications more than the fornication of her sister.
She desired after the sons of Assur, prefects and governors, being near, putting on splendor, horsemen riding horses, young men of desire, all of them.
And I shall see that one way was defiled to both of them.
And she will add to her fornications: and she will see men delineated upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans being delineated with red color.
Girding girdles upon their loins, a superfluity of dippings upon their heads, the appearance of third men all of them, the likeness of the sons of Babel of Chaldea, the land of their birth.
And she will desire after them at the sight of her eyes, and she will send messengers to them to Chaldea.
And the sons of Babel will come to her to the bed of loves, and defile her with their fornications, and she will be defiled with them, and her soul will be rent away from them.
And she will uncover her fornications, and she will uncover her nakedness: and my soul will be rent away from her, as my soul was rent away from her sister.
And she will multiply her fornications, to remember the days of her youth when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.
And she will desire after their paramours, whom the flesh of asses their flesh, and the flowing of horses their flowing.
And thou wilt review the wickedness of thy youth in the doing of Egypt thy breasts for the breasts of thy youth.
For this, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me raising up those loving thee, against thee, whom thy soul was rent away from them, and I brought them against thee from round about.
The sons of Babel and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the sons of Amur with them: young men of desire, prefects and governors, all of them third men, and celebrated, riding horses all of them.
And they came against thee firm with chariot and wheel, and with a convocation of peoples, shield and buckler and helmet, they will set against thee round about: and I gave judgment before them, and they judged thee with their judgments.
And I gave my jealousy against thee, and they did with thee in wrath: thy nose and thine ears they shall take away; and thy posterity shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed in fire.
And they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took the instrument of thy glory.
And I caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes to them, and thou shalt remember Egypt no more.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving thee into the hand of whom thou didst hate, into the hand of whom thy soul was rent away from them.
And they did with thee in hatred, and they took all thy labor, and they left thee naked and nakedness: and the nakedness of thy fornication was uncovered, and thy wickedness and thy fornications.
Doing these to thee for thy fornications after the nations, because thou wert defiled with their blocks.
Thou wentest in the way of thy sister, and I gave her cup into thine hand.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: thou shalt drink thy sister's cup deep and much: thou shalt be for laughter and for derision; containing much.
Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with sorrow, the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Shomeron.
Thou didst drink it and suck out, and thou shalt crush its sherds, and pluck up thy breasts: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
For this, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because thou didst forget me, and thou wilt cast me behind thy back, and also bear thou thy wickedness and thy fornications.
And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah, and announce to them their abominations?
For they committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their blocks they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they brought forth to me they caused to pass through for them for consuming.
Yet this they did to me: they defiled my holy place in that day, and my Sabbaths they profaned.
And in their slaughtering their sons to their blocks, and they will come to my holy place in that day to profane it; and behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.
And also that ye will send to men coming from far off, whom a messenger was sent to them, and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash, thou paintedst thine eyes, and thou didst deck with ornaments.
And thou wilt sit upon a splendid bed, and a table set in order before his face, and thou didst bring up there mine incense and mine oil.
And the voice of a multitude at rest with her: and to the men of multitude of man bringing Sabeans from the desert, and they will give bracelets upon their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads.
And saying to her worn out with adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, she also?
And they will go in to her as going in to a woman an harlot; thus they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the women of wickedness.
And just men they shall judge them with the judgment of adultresses, and with the judgment of those pouring out blood; for they are adultresses, and blood in their hands.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up upon them a convocation and give them for a shaking and for a spoil.
And the convocation stoned upon them with stone, and cut them down with: their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and their houses they will burn in fire.
And I caused wickedness to cease from the land, and all the women were instructed, and they shall not do according to your wickedness.
And they gave your wickedness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your blocks: and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the ninth year, in the teeth month, in the tenth to the month, saying,
Son of man, write to thee the name of the day, this same day: the king of Babel set up against Jerusalem this same day.
And use a parable against the house of contradiction and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Set on the pot, set on, and also pour water into it:
Gather its pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill with the choice of the bones.
Take the choice of the flock and also wheel the bones under it, boil its boilings; also they cooked the bones in the midst of it.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to the city of bloods! the pot which the rust in it, and her rust went not forth from it; bring it forth by its pieces, by its pieces; the lot fell not upon it.
For her blood was in the midst of her; she set it upon a dry rock; she poured it not forth upon the earth to cover over it with dust;
To cause wrath to come up, to avenge vengeance; I gave her blood upon the dry rock not to be covered.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo to the city of bloods! I will make her pile great.
Multiply the woods, kindle the fire, make ready the flesh, and spice with spicing, and the bones shall be burned.
And cause it to stand upon its coals, empty, so that its brass shall be warm and burning, and its uncleanness was melted in the midst of it; its rust shall be consumed.
She was wearied with labors, and her great rust shall not go forth from her: in the fire her rust.
In thy uncleanness is wickedness: because I cleansed thee and thou wert not cleansed, thou shalt no more be cleansed from thy uncleanness till my causing my wrath to rest upon thee.
I Jehovah spake: it came, and I did; I will not let go loose, and I will not spare, and. I will not lament; according to thy ways and according to thy works they judged thee, says the Lord Jehovah.
The word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, behold me taking from thee the desire of thine eyes with a blow: and thou shalt not lament, and thou shalt not weep, and thy tears shall not go.
Be silent to the sighing of blood, thou shalt not make mourning for the dead; bind thy head-dress upon thee, and thou shalt put thy shoes upon thy feet, and thou shalt not cover over the mustachios, and the bread of men thou shalt not eat.
And I shall speak to the people in the morning and my wife will die in the evening and I shall do in the morning as I was commanded.
And the people will say to me, Wilt thou not announce to us what these things to us that thou doest?
And saying to them, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold me profaning my holy place, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the pity of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom ye left, shall fall by the sword.
And ye did as I did: ye shall not cover over your mustachios, and the bread of men ye shall not eat.
And your head-dress upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not lament, and ye shall not weep; and ye pined away m your iniquities, and ye grieved a man to his brother.
And Ezekiel was to you for a wonder: according to all which he did ye shall do: in its coming, and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.
And thou son of man, was it not in the day, I took from them their strength, the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes, the lifting up of their soul, their sons and their daughters.
In that day he escaping shall come to thee to cause to hear with the ears.
In that day thy mouth shall be opened to him escaping and thou shalt speak, and thou shalt no more be dumb: and thou wert to them for a wonder, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them.
And say to the sons of Ammon, Hear ye, the word of the Lord Jehovah, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy saying, Aha! to my holy place, when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel, when it was made desolate, and to the house of Judah, when they went into captivity.
For this, behold me giving thee to the sons of the east for a possession, and they set their fortress in thee and in thee they gave their dwelling, they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
And I gave Rabbah for a rest of camels, and the sons of Ammon for a place of lying down of sheep, and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy striking the hand and thy stamping with the foot and thou wilt rejoice in soul with all contempt against the land of Israel.
For this, behold I stretched forth my hand against thee, and I gave thee for a spoil to the nations, and I cut thee off from the peoples; and I caused thee to perish from the lands: I will destroy thee and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab said, and Seir, Behold, the house of Judah as all the nations;
For this, behold me opening the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from his cities, from his extremity, the glory of the land the house of desolation the place of dwelling, and the double city.
To the sons of the east with the sons of Ammon, I gave it for a possession, so that it shall not make mention of the sons of Ammon among the nations.
And I will do judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because Edom did against the house of Judah by revenging vengeance, and they will transgress a transgression, and they revenged against them;
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I stretched out my hand upon Edom, and I cut of from her man and cattle; and I gave her a waste from the south; and Dedan shall fall by the sword.
And I gave my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they did in Edom according to mine anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the rovers did in vengeance, and they will avenge vengeance with contempt of heart to destroy, a perpetual enmity;
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me stretching forth my hand upon the rovers, and I cut off the executioners, and I destroyed the remnant of the sea coast.
And I did great vengeances upon them with reproofs of wrath; and they shall know that I Jehovah, in my giving vengeance upon them.
And it will be in the eleventh year, in one of the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying.
Son of man, because that Tyre said against Jerusalem Aha! she was broken, the doors of the peoples: she was turned to me: I Shall be filled; she was laid waste:
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Tyre and I brought up many nations against thee as the sea brought up to its waves.
And they destroyed the walls of Tyre, and pulled down her towers and I swept away her dust from her, and I gave her for a dry rock.
It shall be for spreading nets in the midst of the sea: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah: and it was for a spoil to the nations.
An her daughters who are in the field, shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that am Jehovah.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me bringing upon Tyre Nebuchadezzar king of Babel, from the north, a king of kings, with horse and with chariot, and with horsemen, and a convocation, and much people.
Thy daughters in the field he shall slay with the sword: and he gave a watch-tower against thee, and he threw up a mound against thee, and lifted up the buckler against thee.
And he will give the stroke of his front against thy walls, and with his sword he will tear down thy towers.
From the abundance of is horses, their dust will cover thee: from the voice of the horseman, and the wheel, and the chariot, thy walls shall shake, in his coming in to thy gates, as the enterings of a city rent asunder.
With the hoofs of his horses he will tread down all thy streets: he will slay thy people with the sword, and the garrisons of thy strength shall go down to the earth.
And they spoiled thy strength and they plundered thy traffic, and they pulled down thy walls, and they will tear down thy houses of desire, and they will set thy stones and thy woods and thy dust in the midst of the water.
And I caused the noise of thy songs to cease and the voice of thy harps shall no more be heard.
And I gave thee for a dry rock thou Shalt be a spreading of nets; thou shalt no more be built: for I Jehovah spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Shall not islands shake from the voice of thy fall, in the cry of the wounded, in the slaying of the slain in the midst of thee?
And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and they removed their robes, and they shall put off the garments of variegations: they shall put on tremblings; they sat upon the earth and trembled at the moments, and were astonished at thee.
And they lifted up for thee a lamentation, and they said to thee, How wert thou destroyed being inhabited from the seas, the celebrated city which was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants who gave their terrors to all her inhabitants.
Now shall the idles tremble the day of thy fall; and the isles which are in the sea loathed from thy going forth.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: I measured thee a city being desolated as the cities which were not inhabited; in my bringing up the deep upon thee, and many waters covered thee.
And brought thee down with them going down to the pit to the people of old, and I set thee in the earth, underneath in desolations from forever with them going down to the pit, so that thou shalt not be inhabited; and I gave glory in the land of the living.
I will give thee for terrors, and not thee: and thou shalt be sought and shalt not be found any more forever, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Thou son of man, lift up a lamentation for Tyre;
And say to Tyre, Thou dwelling at the entrance of the sea, a traffic of the peoples for many islands, thus said the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou saidst, I am perfect of beauty.
In the heart of the see thy bound; they building thee completed thy beauty.
They built all thy bounds cypress from Shenir: they took cedars from Lebanon to make a mast for thee.
The oaks of Bashan they made thine oars; the house of the Ashurites made thy desk of ivory from the isles of Chittim.
Fine linen with variegation from Egypt was thy spreading forth to be to thee for a signal; cerulean purple, and reddish purple, from the isles of Elisha was thy covering.
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were rowers to thee: thy wise, O Tyre, were in thee, they thy sailors.
The old men of Gebal and her wise were in thee making strong thy breach: all the ships of the sea and thy seamen were in thee to traffic from thy traffic.
Persia and Lud and Phut were in thy strength, thy men of war: hung the shield and helmet in thee; they gave thy decoration.
The sons of Arvad and thine army upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they completed thy beauty.
Tarshish thy merchant from the multitude of all riches: in silver, iron, alloy, and lead, they gave thy markets.
Javan, Tubal and Meshech, they thy merchants: they gave from thy traffic in the soul of man, and vessels of brass.
From the house of Togarmah, horses and horsemen and mules they gave thy markets.
The sons of Dedan thy merchants; many isles the traffic of thy hand: and they brought back horns of ivory and ebony.
Aram thy merchant from the multitude of thy works: they gave in thy markets with the gem, reddish purple, and variegation, and byssus, and red corals, and ruby.
Judah and the land of Israel, they thy merchants: in wheat of Minnith and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balsam, they gave thy traffic.
Damascus thy merchant in the multitude of thy works from the multitude of all riches, with wine of Helbon and wool of whiteness.
And Dan and Javan going away gave in thy markets: making iron, cassia and sweet cane was in thy traffic.
Dedan thy merchant, garments of spreading out for the chariot.
Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they the merchants of thy hand with lambs and rams and he goats: in them thy merchants.
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they thy merchants with the head of all spicery, and with every precious stone and gold they gave thy markets.
Haran and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assur, and Chilmad, thy merchants.
They thy merchants in perfections in coverings of cerulean purple, and variegation and in treasures of variegated stuffs bound with cords and made fast in thy markets.
The ships of Tarshish celebrating thee in thy traffic; and thou wilt be filled and honored greatly in the heart of the sea.
Thy rower brought thee into many waters: the wind of the east broke thee in the heart of the seas.
Thy riches and thy markets, thy traffic, thy seamen, and thy shipmen, they making strong thy breach, and they trafficking thy traffic, and all the men of thy war that are in thee, and in all thy convocation which is in the midst of thee, they shall fall into the heart of the sea, in the day of thy fall.
At the voice of the cry of thy shipmen, the areas shall shake.
All holding the oars, the seamen and the shipmen of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the earth.
And with their voice they shall cause to be heard against thee, and they shall cry with bitterness, and they shall bring up dust upon their heads, and they shall roll themselves in ashes.
And they made themselves bald with baldness for thee, and they girded themselves with sackcloth, and they wept for thee with bitterness of soul and bitter wailing.
And their sons lifted up a lamentation for thee, and they lamented over thee: Who as Tyre, as she desolated in the midst of the sea?
In the going forth of thy markets from the seas thou didst satisfy many peoples; with the multitude of thy riches and thy traffics thou didst enrich the kings of the earth.
The time thou wert broken from the seas in the depths of the waters, thy traffic and all thy convocation fell in the midst of thee.
All the inhabitants of the isles were astonished at thee, and their kings shuddering, shuddered; the faces were moved.
The merchants among the peoples hissed at thee; thou wert terrors; and thou not, even forever.
The word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart was lifted up, and thou wilt say, I am God, I sat upon the seat of God in the heart of the seas; and thou art man and not God, and thou wilt give thy heart as the heart of God.
Behold thee wise above Daniel; not any thing hidden was hidden to thee:
With thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou madest to thee wealth, and thou wilt make gold and silver in thy treasures.
By the multitude of thy wisdom, by thy traffic thou didst multiply thy wealth, and thine heart will be lifted up in thy wealth.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy giving thy heart as the heart of God;
For this, behold me bringing strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they emptied out their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they profaned thy splendor.
They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou didst die the deaths of the wounded in the heart of the seas.
Saying, wilt thou say, I am God, before him slaying thee? and thou art man and not God, in the hand of him wounding thee.
Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, lift up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Thou didst seal up the measure full of wisdom and complete of beauty.
Thou wert in Eden the garden of God: every precious stone thy covering, the ruby, the topaz, the onyx, the chrysolite, the sardonyx and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle and the emerald, and gold: the work of thy drums and thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day of thy being created.
Thou the cherub of expansion covering; and I gave thee: thou wert in the holy mountain of God; thou walkedst about in the midst of the stones of fire.
Thou shalt be perfected in thy ways from the day of thy being created even till iniquity was found in thee.
In the multitude of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou wilt sin: and I shall profane thee from the mountain of God, and destroying thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
Thine heart was lifted up with thy beauty, thou didst corrupt thy wisdom on account of thy splendor: I cast thee upon the earth, I gave thee before kings to look upon thee.
From the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic, thou didst profane my holy places; and I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall consume thee, and I will give thee for ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all seeing thee.
All knowing thee among the peoples were astonished at thee: thou wert terrors; and thou not, even to forever.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face against Zidon and prophesy against, her,
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against, thee, O Zidon; and I was honored in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my doing judgments upon her; and I was consecrated in her.
And I sent death into her, and blood in her streets; and the wounded fell in the midst of her by, the sword upon her from round about: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And no more shall there be to the house of Israel a thorn making bitter; and briars causing pain from all round about them despising them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: in my gathering the house of Israel from the peoples where they were scattered among them, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of the nations, and they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob.
And they dwelt upon it with confidence, and, they built houses, and they planted vineyards; and they dwelt with confidence in my doing judgments upon all those despising them from round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.
In the tenth year, in the tenth, in the twelfth to the month, was the word of Jehovah to me, saying,
Son of man set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt:
Speak and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great sea monster lying in the midst of his rivers, who said, The, river is to me, and I made me.
And I gave hooks in thy jaw bones, and I glued the fishes of thy rivers upon thy scales, and I brought thee up from the midst of thy rivers, and all the Ashes of thy rivers shall be glued to thy scales.
And I cast thee to the desert, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the face of the field; thou shalt not be gathered, and thou shalt not be collected: I gave thee for food to the beast of the earth and to the birds of the heavens.
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they were a support of reed to the house of Israel:
In their taking hold upon thee by the hand, thou wilt run and rend for them all the shoulder: and in their leaning upon thee, thou: wilt break, and because to them the loins to stand.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me bringing the sword upon thee, and I cut off from thee man and cattle.
And the land of Egypt was for desolation and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he said, The river is to me; I made.
For this, behold me against thee, and against thy rivers, and I gave the land of Egypt for wastes of waste, a desolation from the tower Seveneh and even to the bound of Cush.
The foot of man shall not pass through it, and the foot of cattle shall not pass through it, and it shall not be inhabited forty years.
And I gave the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the lands being desolate, and her, cities in the midst of the cities laid waste shall be a desolation forty years: and I scattered Egypt among the nations and I dispersed them in the lands.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: From the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples where they were scattered there:
And I turned back the captivity of Egypt; and I caused them to turn back to the land of Paths upon the land of their nativity; and they were there a low kingdom.
It shall be lower than the kingdoms, and it shall no more be lifted up over the nations: and I made them few not to rule over the nations.
And it shall be no more to the house of Israel for trust, bringing iniquity to remembrance in their turning after them: and they shall know that am the Lord Jehovah.
And it will be in the twenty and seventh year, in the first, in the one to the month, the word, of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head being made bald, and every shoulder made smooth: and wages were not to him and to his army from Tyre for the service that he served against her.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, the land of Egypt; and he lifted up her multitude, and he spoiled her spoil and plundered her plunder, and it was the wages to his army.
I gave to him the land of Egypt the wages which he served against her, because they worked for me, says the Lord Jehovah.
In that day I will cause the born to the house of Israel to spring up, and to thee will I give the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah,
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wail ye, Wo to the day!
For the day is near, the day of Jehovah is near, the day of a cloud; it shall be the time of the nations.
And the sword came upon Egypt, and pain was upon Cush, in the falling of the wounded in Egypt; and they took her multitude and her foundations were torn down.
Cosh and Phut and Lad, and all the intermingled, and Chub, and the sons of the land of the covenant, with them shall fall by the sword.
Thus said Jehovah: and they upholding Egypt fell, and the pride of her strength came down: from the tower Seveneh shall they fall in her by the sword, says the Lord Jehovah.
And they were desolate in the midst of the lands being desolated, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities being laid waste.
And they knew that I am Jehovah in my giving fire in Egypt, and all her helpers were broken.
In that day shall go forth messengers from before me in ships to make confiding Cush afraid, and pain was upon them as the day of Egypt: for behold, it came.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I caused the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel.
He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, being brought to destroy the land: and they emptied their swords upon Egypt, and they filled the land with the wounded.
And I gave the rivers dryness and I sold the land, into the hand of the evil: and I made the land desolate, and its fulness by the hand, of strangers: I Jehovah spake.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And I destroyed the blocks, and I caused their nothings to cease from Noph; and a prince of the land of Egypt shall be no more: and I gave fear in the land of Egypt.
And I made Pathros desolate, and I gave fire in Zoan, and I did judgments in No.
And I poured out my wrath upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I cut off the multitude of No.
And I gave fire in Egypt, and Sin writhing, shall be in pain, and No shall be for breaking in pieces, and Noph straits in the day.
The young men of Aven and Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these shall go into captivity.
And in Tahhapanes the day was darkened in my breaking there the rods of Egypt: and the pride of her strength ceased in her: she, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
And I did judgments in Egypt; and they knew that am Jehovah.
And it will be in the eleventh year, in the first, in the seventh to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, I broke the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and behold, it not bound up to give healing, to put in bandages to bind it, to make it strong to hold upon the sword.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I brake his arms, the strong, and the broken; and I caused the sword to fall from his hand.
And I scattered Egypt among the nations, and I dispersed them in the lands.
And I strengthened the arms of the king of Babel, and I gave my sword into his hand: and I brake the arms of Pharaoh, and he groaned the groanings of the wounded before his face.
And I strengthened the arms of the king of Babel, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my giving my sword into the hand of the king of Babel; and he stretched it out against the land of Egypt.
And I scattered Egypt among the nations, and I dispersed them in the lands; and they knew that I am Jehovah.
And it will be in the eleventh year, in the third, in one to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: To whom wert thou like in thy greatness?
Behold, Assur a cedar in Lebanon, fair of branch, and a shading thicket, and high of stature; and his foliage was between the thick boughs.
The water made him great, the deep raised him up with her rivers going round about her planting, and she sent forth her channels to all the trees of the field.
For this his height was lifted up more than all the trees of the field, and his boughs will be multiplied, and his branches will be extended from many waters, in his sending forth.
And all the birds of the heavens nested in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth, and in his shadow dwelt all the great nations.
And he was fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by many waters.
The cedars did not hide him in the garden of God: the cypresses were not like to his boughs, and the plane trees were not as his branches; every tree in the garden of God was not like to him in his beauty.
I made him fair by the multitude of his branches, and all the trees of Eden which are in the garden of God will envy him.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thou wert lifted up in height, and he will give his foliage between the thick boughs, and his heart was lifted up in his height;
And I will give him into the hand of the God of the nations; he shall do his doing to him: I drove him out for his injustice.
And strangers, the terrible of the nations, shall cut him off and cast him down: upon the mountains and in all the galleys his branches fell, and his boughs shall be broken by all the torrents of the land; and all the people of the land shall go down from his shadow, and will cast him down.
Upon his fall shall all the fowls of the heavens sit, and upon his branches were all the beasts of the field:
So that all the trees of the waters shall not be lifted up in height, and they shall not give their foliage between the thick boughs, and all they drinking water shall not stand upon them in their height: for they all were given to death, to the earth underneath, in the midst of the sons of man, to those going down to the pit.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of his going down to hades caused to mourn: I covered the deep over him, and I shall restrain its floods, and many waters shall be withheld: and I will cause Lebanon to be darkened for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
From the voice of his fall I caused the nations to tremble, in my causing him to go down to hades with those going down to the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and good of Lebanon, all drinking water and they shall be comforted in the earth underneath.
They also went down with him to hades, to those being wounded with the sword; and his arm they dwelt in his shadow in the midst of the nations.
To whom wert thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Men? and thou wert brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth underneath: in the midst of the uncircumcised thou shalt lie, with the wounded of the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
And it will be in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in one to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, Thou wert like a young lion of the nations, and thou as a whale in the seas: and thou wilt break forth with thy rivers, and trouble the waters with thy feet, and thou wilt tread their rivers.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: and I spread my net over thee with a convocation of many peoples; and they brought thee up in my net.
And I cast thee down upon the earth, upon the face of the field will I throw thee, and I caused all the birds of the heavens to sit upon thee, and I satiated from thee the beasts of all the earth.
And I gave thy flesh upon the mountains, and I filled the valleys with thy height.
And I watered the earth with thine inundation from thy blood, to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full from thee.
And I covered the heavens in my quenching thee, and I darkened their stars; and I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not enlighten with its light.
All the luminaries of light in the heavens I will darken them over thee, and I gave darkness upon thy land, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I irritated the heart of many peoples in my bringing thy breaking among the nations, upon lands which ye knew not.
And I caused many peoples to be astonished over thee, and kings shall shudder with shuddering over thee in my brandishing my sword over their faces; and they trembled at the moments each for his soul in the day of thy fall.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babel shall come into thee.
By the swords of the strong will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they destroyed the pride of Egypt, and all her multitude were destroyed.
And I destroyed all her cattle above many waters; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more, and the hoofs of cattle shall not trouble them.
Then will I cause their waters to subside, and I will cause their rivers to go as oil, says the Lord Jehovah.
In my giving the land of Egypt a desolation, and the land was desolate from her fulness in my striking all dwelling in it; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
This the lamentation and the daughters of the nations lamented her: they shall lament her for Egypt, and for all her multitude they shall lament her, says the Lord Jehovah.
And it will be in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth to the month, the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,
Son of man, Wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast it down, her, and the daughters of the powerful nations, to the earth underneath, with those going down to the pit.
Above whom wert thou lovely? go down, and lie with the uncircumcised.
In the midst of the wounded of the sword shall they fall: she was given to the sword: do ye draw her out and all her multitude.
The strong of the mighty shall say to him from the midst of hades with his helpers: they went down; they lay uncircumcised, wounded of the sword.
Assur there and all her convocation; his graves round about him: all of them wounded, fallen by the sword.
Whose graves were given in the thighs of the pit, and her convocation will be round about her grave; all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who gave terror in the land of the living.
There Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them wounded, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised to the earth underneath, who gave their terror in the land of the living; and they will bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
In the midst of the wounded they gave a bed to her with all her multitude: her graves round about him; all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword: for their terror was given in the land of the living, and they shall bear their shame with those going down to the pit: he was given into the midst of the wounded.
There Meshech and Tubal and all dyer multitude: round about him her graves: all of them uncircumcised, wounded of the sword, for they gave their terror in the land of the living.
And they shall not lie with the strong fallen of the uncircumcised, who went down to hades with the weapons of their war: and they will give their swords under their heads, and their iniquities shall be upon their bones for the terror of the strong in the land of the living.
And thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and thou shalt lie with the wounded of the sword.
There Edom, her kings and all her princes who were given with their strength with the wounded of the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those going down to the pit.
There the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians who went down with the wounded; with their terror being ashamed of their strength; and they shall lie uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, and bear their shame with those going down to the pit.
Pharaoh shall see them, and he was comforted over all her multitude wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, says the Lord Jehovah.
For I gave his terror in the land of the living: and he lay down in the midst of the uncircumcised with the wounded of the sword, Pharaoh and all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people and say to them, A land, when I shall bring the sword upon her, and the people of the land took one man from their extremities, and they gave him to them for a watchman.
And he saw the sword coming upon the land, and he struck upon the trumpet and warned the people;
And he hearing, heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; and the sword will come and take him away; his blood shall be upon his head.
He heard the voice of the trumpet, and he took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. He taking warning delivered his soul.
And if the watchman shall see the sword coming, and he struck not upon the trumpet, and the people were not warned; and the sword shall come and take a soul from them, he was taken away in his iniquity, and his blood I will seek from the watchman's hand.
And thou son of man, I gave thee a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou heardest the word from my mouth, and thou didst warn them from me.
In my saying to the, unjust, O unjust one, dying, thou shalt die; and thou spakest not to warn the unjust from his way, that unjust one shall die in his iniquity, and I will seek his blood from thine hand.
And thou, if thou warnedst the unjust from his way to turn back from it, and be turned not back from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; and thou didst deliver thy soul.
And thou son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus ye said, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pining away in them, and how shall we live?
Say to them, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I shall delight in the death of the unjust; but in the turning back of the unjust one from his way, and he lived: turn back, turn back from your evil ways: and wherefore will ye die, O house of Israel?
And thou, son of man, say to the sons of my people, The justice of the just shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: and the injustice of the unjust, he shall not stumble in it in the day of his turning back from his injustice; and the just shall not be able to live in the day of his sinning.
In my saying to the just, living, he shall live; and he trusted upon his justice, and he did evil, all his justice shall not be remembered; and in his iniquity which he did he shall die in it.
And in my saying to the unjust, Dying, thou shalt die; and he turned back from his sinning and he did judgment and justice;
The unjust shall turn back the pledge he shall restore the spoil, going in the laws of the living not to do evil; living, he shall live, he shall not die.
All his sins which he sinned shall not be remembered to him: he did judgment and justice; living, he shall live.
And the sons of my people said, The way of Jehovah will not make even: and they their way shall not make even.
In the turning back of the just from his justice and doing iniquity, he shall die in them.
And in the turning back of the unjust from his injustice and doing judgment and justice upon them, he shall live.
And ye said, The way of Jehovah will not make even. I will judge you each according to his ways, O house of Israel.
And it will be in the twelfth year, in the tenth, in the fifth to the month, to our captivity, he having escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city was struck.
And the hand of Jehovah was to me in the evening, before he having escaped came; and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning; and he will open my mouth and I was no more dumb.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, they inhabiting these wastes upon the land of Israel say, saying, Abraham was one, and he will inherit the land: and we are many; the land was given to us for a possession.
For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Ye will eat with the bloods, and ye will lift up your eyes to your blocks, and ye will pour out blood: and shall ye possess the land?
Ye stood upon your sword, ye did abomination, and ye defiled each his neighbor's wife: and shall ye possess the land?
Thus shalt thou say to them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I live if not they who are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and he who is upon the face of the field I gave him to the beast to eat him, and they who are in the fastnesses and in caves shall die by death.
And I gave the land a desolation and an amazement, and I caused the pride of her strength to cease; and the mountains of Israel were desolate from none passing through.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah in my giving the land a desolation and an astonishment for all their abominations which they did.
And thou son of man, the sons of my people are speaking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speaking one to another, a man to his brother, saying, Come now and hear what the word coming forth from Jehovah.
And they will come to thee, according to the coming of the people, and they will sit before thee my people, and they heard thy words, and they did them not: for they making loves with their mouth, their heart went after their plunder.
And behold thee to them as song of loves of a fair voice, playing well an instrument: and they heard thy words and did them not.
And in its coming (behold, it came) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo! to the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves: shall not the shepherds feed the sheep?
Ye will eat the fat, and ye will put on the wool, ye will sacrifice the fatlings: ye will not feed the sheep.
Ye strengthened not the sickly, and the diseased ye healed not, and the broken ye bound not up, and the thrust away ye turned not back, and the lost ye sought not; and with force and with oppression ye ruled them.
And they will be scattered from Without a shepherd: and they will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field, and they will be scattered.
My sheep will wander upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill: and upon all the face of the earth my flock was scattered, and none searching and none seeking.
For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:
I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not my sheep were for plunder and my sheep will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field from no shepherd; and the shepherds sought not my sheep, and the shepherds will feed themselves, and my sheep they fed not.
For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against the shepherds; and I sought my flock from their hand, and I caused them to cease from feeding the sheep: and the shepherds shall no more feed themselves; and I delivered my flock from their face, and they shall not be to them for consuming.
For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me. I also sought my sheep, and I searched them out.
According to the seeking of the shepherd of his flock in the day of his being in the midst of his sheep being scattered; so will I search out my sheep and deliver them from all places where they were scattered there in the day of cloud and darkness.
And I brought them out from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands, and I brought them to their land, and I fed them upon the mountains of Israel by the torrents, and in all the dwellings of the earth.
In a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their rest: there shall they lie in a good rest, and a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.
I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.
The lost I will seek out, and the thrust away I will turn back, and to the broken I will bind up, and the diseased I will strengthen: and the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them with judgment.
And ye, my sheep, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold me judging between sheep to sheep, to the rams and to the he goats.
Is it small for you ye will feed the good pasture, and the remainder of your pastures ye will tread down with your feet? and ye will drink front the settled waters and that being left they will tread with your feet.
And my sheep will feed of the trodden down of your feet; and they will drink of the treading of your feet.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold me I also judged between fat sheep and between lean sheep.
Because with side and with shoulder ye will thrust away, and with your horns ye pushed all the sickly till that ye scattered them without;
And I saved my sheep, and they shall no more be for plunder; and I judged between sheep to sheep.
And I raised up one shepherd over them, and he fed them, my servant David; he shall feed them and he shall be to them for shepherd.
I Jehovah will be to them for God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them; I Jehovah spake.
And I cut out to them a covenant of peace, and I caused the evil beast to cease from the land: and they dwelt with confidence in the desert, and they slept in the forests.
And I gave them and round about my hill a blessing; and I brought down the rain in its time, and they shall be rains of blessing.
And the tree of the field gave its fruit, and the land shall give her produce, and they shall be upon their land with confidence, and they knew that I am Jehovah in my breaking the rods of their yoke; and I delivered them from the hand of those serving themselves in them.
And they shall no more be plunder to the nations, and the beast of the earth shall not eat them; and they dwelt confidently and none making afraid.
And I raised up to them a plant for a name, and they shall be no more taken away by famine in the land, and they shall no more bear the shame of the nations.
And they knew that I Jehovah their God with them, and they my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men, I your God, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of the Lord will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.
And say to it, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O mount Seir; and I stretched out my hand upon thee a desolation and an amazement.
I will set thy cities a waste, and thou shalt be a desolation, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.
Because there was a perpetual enmity to thee, and thou wilt pour out the sons of Israel by the hands of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of iniquity the end:
For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, for I will make thee for blood and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hatedst not blood, and blood shall pursue thee.
And I gave mount Seir for a desolation, and desolation, and I cut off from it him passing through and him turning back.
And I filled his mountains with his wounded: in thy hills and in thy valleys, and all thy torrents the wounded of the sword shall fall in them:
I will give thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
Because of thy saying, The two nations and the two lands shall be to me, and we will possess it; and Jehovah was there:
For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, and I did according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou didst in thy hatred against them; and I was known among them according to that I will judge thee.
And thou knewest that I am Jehovah; I heard all thy reproaches which thou spakest against the mountains of Israel, saying, They were given to us a desolation to consume.
And ye will be magnified against me with your mouth, and ye multiplied your words against me: I heard.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: When all the earth rejoiced I will make thee a desolation.
For thy rejoicing at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was a desolation, thus will I do to thee: thou shalt be a desolation O mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah:
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against you, Aha! and the heights of old were for a possession to us:
For this, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because for, because of making desolate, and panting after you from round about, for you to be a possession for the remainder of the nations, and ye will come up upon the lips of the tongue and a slander of the people:
For this ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the torrents and to the valleys, and to the desolate wastes, and to cities being forsaken which were for plunder and for derision to the rest of the nations that are from round about;
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: If not in the fire of my jealousy I spake against the rest of the nations and against all Edom who gave my land to them for a possession with joy of all the heart, with contempt of soul for casting it out for plunder.
For this, prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, and to the torrents and to the valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me, in my jealousy and in my wrath did I speak because ye bore the shame of the nations.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I lifted up my hand; if not the nations who are from round about to you, they shall bear their shame.
And ye mountains of Israel, ye shall give your branch, and ye shall bear your fruit to my people Israel; for they drew near to come.
For behold me for you, and I turned to you and ye were tilled and sown.
And I multiplied man upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it: and the cities were inhabited and the wastes shall be built.
And I multiplied upon you man and cattle; and they multiplied and were fruitful: and I caused you to dwell according to your former times, and I did good above your beginnings: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.
And I caused man to go upon you, my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou wert to them for an inheritance, and thou shalt no more add to bereave them.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of their saying to you, Thou didst consume man, and thou wert bereaving thy nations.
For this, thou shalt no more consume man, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation; says the Lord Jehovah.
And I will no more cause to be heard in thee the shame of the nations, and thou shalt bear no more the reproach of the peoples, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nations, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, the house of Israel dwelling upon their land, and they will defile it with their way and with their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of her set apart.
And I will pour out my wrath upon them upon the blood which they poured out upon the land, and they defiled it by their blocks:
And I will scatter them among the nations, and they shall be dispersed in the lands: according to their ways and according to their doings, I judged them.
And he will come to the nations where they came in there, and they will profane my holy name in saying to them, These the people of Jehovah, and they went forth from their land.
And I will spare for my holy name that the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went there.
For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I do not for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name which ye profaned among the nations where ye went there.
And I consecrated my great name, being profaned among the nations which ye profaned, in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, in my being consecrated among you before your eyes.
And I took you from the nations and I gathered you from all the lands, and I brought you into your land.
And I sprinkled clean waters upon you, and ye were cleansed: from all your uncleannesses and from all your blocks will I cleanse you.
And I gave to you a new heart, and a new spirit will I give in the midst of you: and I turned away your heart of stone from your flesh, and I gave to you an heart of flesh.
And my spirit I will, give in the midst of you, and I made that ye shall go in my laws, and my judgments shall ye watch and do.
And ye dwelt in the land which I gave to your fathers, and ye were to me for a people, and I shall be to you for God.
And I saved you from all your uncleannesses: and I called for the grain and I multiplied it, and I will not give famine upon you.
And I multiplied the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that ye shall no more take the reproach of famine among the nations.
And ye remembered your evil ways and your doings which not being good, and ye loathed with your faces for your iniquities and for your abominations.
I did not for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah, it shall be known to you: be ashamed and be disgraced for your ways, O house of Israel.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah; In the day of my cleansing you from all your iniquities, and I caused the cities to be inhabited, and the walls were built.
And the desolate land shall be worked instead of its being a desolation before the eyes of all passing by.
And they said: This land being desolate was as the garden of Eden: and the cities laid waste and desolated and destroyed, being fortified, were inhabited.
And the nations which shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah built the destroyed, I planted the desolated: I Jehovah spake, and I did.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet this will I be sought out to the house of Israel, to do to them; I will multiply them with men as sheep.
As holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her appointments; thus shall the cities laid waste be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me forth in the spirit of Jehovah, and he will set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was filled with bones.
And he caused me to pass over them round about, round about: and behold, exceeding many upon the face of the valley; and behold, exceedingly dry.
And he will say to me, Son of man, shall these bones live? And saying, Thou Lord Jehovah knoweth.
And he will say to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I bring upon you the spirit, and ye lived.
And I gave sinews upon you, and I brought up flesh upon you, and I drew skin over you, and I gave spirit in you, and ye lived; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.
And I prophesied as I was commanded: and there will be a voice as I prophesied, and behold a shaking, the bones will draw near, bone to his bone.
And I saw and behold, upon them sinews and flesh came up, and the skin will draw over them from above: and no spirit in them.
And he will say to me, prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O wind and blow upon these slain, and they shall live.
And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit will come upon them and they will live, and they will stand upon their feet, an army great, exceedingly, exceedingly.
And he will say to me, Son of man, these bones all the house of Israel: behold them saying, Our bones were dried up, and our hope perished, and we were cut off to us.
For this, prophesy and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I opened your graves and brought you up from your graves, O my people, and I brought you to the land of Israel.
And ye knew that I was Jehovah in my opening your graves and in my bringing you up from your graves, O my People.
And I gave my spirit in you, and ye lived, and I caused you to rest upon your land: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake, and I did, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
And thou son of man, take to thee one tree and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his company: and take one tree and write upon it, For Joseph, the tree of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel his company:
And draw them near one to one to thee, for one tree; and they were for one in thine hand.
And when the sons of thy people shall say to thee, saying, Wilt thou not announce to us what these to thee?
Speak to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold I take the tree of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his company, and I gave them upon him with the tree of Judah, and ye made them for one tree, and they were one in my hand.
And the trees which thou shalt write upon them were in thy hand before their eyes.
And speak to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they went there, and I gathered them from round about, and I brought them to their land:
And I made them for one nation in the land in the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be to them all for king: and they shall no more be for two nations, and they shall no more be divided into two kingdoms at all.
And they shall no more be defiled with their blocks and with their abominable things, and in all their transgressions: and I saved them from all their dwellings where they sinned in them, and I cleansed them: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.
And my servant David a king over them; and one shepherd shall be to all of them: and in my judgments they shall go and they shall watch my laws and do them.
And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to my servant to Jacob which your fathers dwelt upon it, and they shall dwell upon it, they and their sons and their sons' sons, even to forever: and David my servant a prince to them forever.
And I cut out to them a covenant of peace; it shall be an eternal covenant with them: and I gave them, and I multiplied them, and I gave my holy place in the midst of them forever.
And my dwelling was with them, and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.
And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah consecrating Israel in my holy place, being in the midst of them forever.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the head prince of Meeheoh and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, head prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:
And I turned thee back, and I gave hooks in thy jaw bones, and I brought thee forth and all thine army of horses and horsemen, clothed in perfection, all of them a great convocation with buckler and shield, holding swords all of them:
Persia, Cush and Phut with them, all of them with shield and helmet.
Gomer and all his hosts; the house of Togarmah of the thighs of the north, and all his hosts: many peoples with thee.
Be prepared, and be prepared for thyself, thou, and all thy convocation convoked together to thee, and be to them for watching.
From many days thou shalt be reviewed: in the last of the years thou shalt come to the land turned back from the sword, being gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which were continually for waste: and she was brought forth from the peoples, and they dwelt confidently all of them.
Ascending, thou shalt come as a storm, as a cloud to cover the earth shalt thou be and all thy hosts, and many peoples with thee.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah and it was in that day words will come up upon thy heart, and thou purposed an evil purpose:
And thou saidst, I will come up upon the land of the open country; I will go to those being at rest, dwelling confidently, all of them dwelling without a wall, and bar and doors not to them,
To spoil a spoil and to plunder a plunder; to turn back thy hand upon the wastes being inhabited, and upon the people being gathered out of the nations making cattle and substance, dwelling upon the summit of the land.
Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish, and all her young lions, they shall say to thee, For spoiling a spoil art thou come? For plundering a plunder didst thou call together thy convocation? to lift up silver and gold, to take cattle and substance, to spoil a great spoil?
For this, prophesy, O son of man, and say to Gog, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day in my people Israel dwelling confidently, shalt thou not know?
And thou earnest out of the places from the thighs of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, riding horses all of them, a great convocation and much strength:
And coming up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the last of the days, and brought thee forth against my land, for the nations to know me in my being consecrated in thee before their eyes, O Gog.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in days of old by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, prophesying in those days years to bring thee against them?
And it was in that day, in the day Gog came upon the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, my wrath shall come up in my face.
And in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath I spake, If not in that day shall be a great shaking upon the land of Israel.
And from my face shall shake the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, and every man which is upon the face of the earth; and the mountains were overthrown, and the precipices fell, and every wall shall fall to the earth.
And I called to all my mountains a sword against him, says the Lord Jehovah: and the sword of each shall be against his brother.
And I will contend with him with death and with blood; and an overflowing rain, and hailstones, fire and sulphur will I rain upon him and upon his hosts, and upon many peoples which are with him.
And I magnified myself, and I consecrated myself; and I was made known to the eyes of many nations, and they knew that I am Jehovah.
And thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:
And I turned thee back, and I led thee, and I caused thee to come up from the thighs of the north, and I brought thee upon the mountains of Israel:
And I struck thy bow out of thy left hand, and thine arrows will I cause to fall from thy right hand.
Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: to the ravenous bird, the bird of every wing, and to the beasts of the field I gave to consume.
Upon the face of the field thou shalt fall: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I sent a fire upon Magog, and upon them dwelling with confidence in the islands: and they knew that I am Jehovah.
And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel; and I will no more profane my holy name: and the nations shall know that am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.
Behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah; this the day which I spake.
And they dwelling in the cities of Israel went forth and kindled and set on fire with the weapons and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and with the rods of the hand and with the spear, and they burnt a fire with them seven years:
And they shall not lift up wood from the field, and they shall not cut down from the forests; for they shall kindle fire with the weapons, and they spoiled those spoiling them, and they plundered those plundering them, says the Lord Jehovah.
And it was in that day, I will give to Gog a place there, a sepulchre in Israel, the valley of those passing through east of the sea: and it stopped those passing by: and they buried there Gog, and all his multitude: and they called the valley, The Multitude.
And the house of Israel buried them to cleanse the land seven months.
And they buried all the people of the land: and it was to them for name the day of honoring me; says the Lord Jehovah.
And they shall separate men continually, passing through in the land burying those transported with those remaining upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: from the end of seven months they shall search.
And they caused to pass through, passed through in the land, and he seeing a bone of man and he built a pillar by it, they burying, buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.
And also the name of the city, The Multitude. And they cleansed the land.
And thou, son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Say to the bird of every wing and to all the beasts of the field, Gather yourselves together, and come; assemble yourselves from round about to my sacrifice which I sacrifice to you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye ate flesh and drank blood.
The flesh of the strong shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, rams, lambs and he goats, bullocks being fattened, of Bashan all of them.
And ye ate fat to satiety, and ye drank blood to drunkenness, from my sacrifice which I sacrificed for you.
And ye were satiated at my table with horse and chariot, with the strong, and every man of war, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I gave my honor among the nations, and all the nations saw my judgments which I did, and my hand that I put upon them.
And the house of Israel knew that I am Jehovah their God, from this day and farther.
And the nations shall know that for their iniquity the house of Israel were carried away captive: because they transgressed against me, and I will hide my face from them, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall fall by the sword, all of them.
According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did with them, and I will hide my face from them.
For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Now will I turn back the captivity of Jacob, and I compassionated all the house of Israel, and I was jealous for my holy name.
And they bare their shame and all their transgression which they transgressed against me, in their dwelling upon their land confidently, and none terrifying.
In my turning them back from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands of their enemies, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of many nations;
And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God in my carrying them captive to the nations: and I collected them into their land, and I will no more leave from them there.
And I will no more bide my face from them, for I poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.
In the twenty and fifth year to our captivity, in the beginning, of the year, in the tenth to the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in this very day the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me there.
In the visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and he will set me down upon an exceeding high mountain, and upon it as the building of a city from the south.
And he will bring me there, and behold, a man, his appearance as the appearance of brass, and a cord of flax in his hand, and a reed of measure; and he stood in the gate.
And the man will speak to me, Son of man, see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart to all which I cause thee to see; for in order to cause thee to see thou went brought hither: announce all which thou seest to the house of Israel.

For they were from threes, and no pillars to them as the pillars of the enclosures: for this it was contracted from the lower and from the middle from the earth.
And the wall that was without over against the cells, the way of the enclosure without to the face of the cells, its length, fifty cubits.

And he will say to me, The cells of the north, the cells of the south which are at the face of the separated place, they the cells of the holy place, where the priests shall eat there, that draw near to Jehovah, the holies of holies: there shall they set the holies of holies, and the gift, and the sin, and the trespass; for the place is holy.
On the priests coming in, and they shall go not forth from the holy place to the enclosure without, and there they shall set their garments which they shall serve in them; for they are holy; they shall put on other garments, and approach to that for the people.
And he finished the measure of the inner house, and he brought me forth the way of the gate whose face the way of the east, and he measured it round about, round about.

And he will cause me to go to the gate, the gate whose face the way of the east.
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice as the voice of many waters; and the earth was illuminated from his glory.
And as the appearance of the vision which I saw, as the vision which I saw in my coming to destroy the city: and the visions as the vision which I saw at the river Chebar; and I shall fall upon my face.
And the glory of Jehovah came into the house the way of the gate which its face the way of the east.
And the spirit will lift me up and bring me to the inner enclosure; behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
And I shall hear him speaking to me from the house; and a man was standing by me.
And he will say to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I shall dwell there in the midst of the sons of Israel forever, and the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, they and their kings by their fornication, and by the corpses of their kings in their heights.
In their giving their threshold with my thresholds, and their door-post by my door-posts, and the wall between me and between them, and they defiled my holy name with their abominations which they did: and consuming them in my anger.
Now they shall put far off their fornication, and the corpses of their kings, from me, and I dwelt in the midst of them forever.
Thou son of man, announce to the house of Israel, the house, and they shall be ashamed of their iniquities: and measure the structure.
And if they were ashamed of all which they did, the form of the house and its structure, and all its goings out and all its comings in, and all its forms, and all its laws, and all its forms, and all its instructions, make known to them: and write before their eyes, and they shall watch all its instructions and all its laws, and do them.
This the instruction of the house: Upon the head of the mountain all its bound round about, round about, holy of holies. Behold, this the instruction of the house.
And these the measures of the altar by cubits: a cubit, a cubit and a hand-breadth; and the bosom, a cubit and a cubit the breadth; and its bound to its lip round about, one span: and this the back of the altar.
And from the bosom of the earth even to the lower terrace, two cubits, and the breadth, one cubit; and from the small terrace even to the great terrace, four cubits, and the breadth, the cubit.
And the mountain of God, four cubits; and from the lion of God and upwards, four horns.
And the lion of God, twelve the length by twelve the breadth; four square to its four squares.
And the terrace, fourteen the length by fourteen the breadth, to its four squares; and the bound round about it half a cubit, and the bosom to it, a cubit round about; and its steps turning east.
And he will say to me, Son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: These the laws of the altar in the day of Making it to bring up a burnt-offering upon it, and to sprinkle upon it blood.
And give to the priests the Levites, those which are of the seed of Zadok, drawing near to me, says the Lord Jehovah, to save me, a bullock, son of a cow, for sin.
And take from its blood and give upon its four horns, and to the four corners of the terrace, and to the border round about: and cleanse it and expiate it.
And take the bullock of the sin and burn it in the appointed place of the house from without to the holy place.
And in the second day thou shalt bring near a kid of the goats complete for sin; and cleanse ye the altar as they cleansed for the bullock.
In thy finishing the cleansing thou shalt bring a bullock, son of a cow, blameless, and a blameless ram front the sheep;
And bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests cast salt upon them, and they brought them up a burnt-offering to Jehovah.
Seven days thou shalt do a he goat of sin for the day, and a bullock, son of a cow, and a ram from the sheep, blameless, shall they do.
Seven days and they expiated the altar, and they cleansed it; and they filled his hand.
And they finished the days, and it was in the eighth day and forward, the priests will do your burnt-offerings upon the altar, and your peace: and I received you into favor, says the Lord Jehovah.
And he turned me back the way of the gate of the holy place with out, looking to the east; and it was shut.
And Jehovah will say to me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and a man shall not come in through it; because Jehovah God of Israel came in through it and it was shut.
The prince, the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah; from the way of the porch of the gate he will go in, and from its way he went out.
And he will bring me the way of the gate of the north to the face of the house: and I shall see, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah: and I shall fall upon my face.
And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, set thy heart, and see with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all which I speak to thee concerning all the laws of the house of Jehovah, and concerning all its instructions; and set thy heart to the entering of the house, and all the goings out of the holy place.
And thou shalt say to the perverse to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough for you of all your abominations, O house of Israel.
In your bringing in the sons of the stranger, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, to be in my holy place to profane it, my house, in your bringing near my bread, the fat and the blood, and they will break my covenant by all your abominations.
And ye watched not the watches of my holy place: and ye set for watching of my watches in my holy place for yourselves.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Every son of the stranger, uncircumcised of heart and uncircumcised of flesh, shall not come in to my holy place, to every son of the stranger which is the midst of the sons of Israel.
But the Levites who went far off from me, in the going astray of Israel who went astray from me after the blocks; and they bare their iniquity.
And they were serving in my holy place, reviewing at the gates of the house, and serving the house: they shall slaughter the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to serve them.
Because they will serve them before their blocks, and they were to the house of Israel for a stumbling block of iniquity; for this I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Jehovah, and they bare their iniquity.
And they shall not come near to me to be priest to me, to come near all my holy things, to the holies of holies: and they bare their shame, and their abominations which they did.
And I gave them watchers of the watches of the house for all its service, and for all which shall be done in it.
And the priests the Levites, sons of Zadok, who watched the watches of my holy place in the going astray of the sons of Israel from me, they shall draw near to me to serve me, and they stood before me to bring near to me the fat and the blood, says the Lord Jehovah:
They shall come into my holy place, and they shall draw near to my table, to serve me; and they watched my watches.
And it was in their going in to the gates of the inner enclosure they shall put on linen garments; and wool shall not come up upon them in their serving in the gates of the inner enclosure, and the house.
And linen turbans shall be upon their heads, and linen drawers shall be upon their loins; and they shall not be girded with sweat.
And in their going forth to the enclosure without, to the enclosure to the people, they shall lay off their garments which they serve in them, and set them in the cells of the holy place, and put on other garments; and they shall not consecrate the people in their garments.
And they shall not shave their heads, and shearing, they shall shear their beads.
And they shall not drink wine every priest in their going in to the inner enclosure.
And they Shall not take a widow and her thrust away, to them for wives: but virgins from the seed of the house of Israel, and a widow which shall be a widow from a priest, shall they take.
And they shall point out to my people between the holy to the profane, and they shall cause them to know between the unclean to the clean.
And upon contention they shall stand to judge in my judgments, and they judged: and my instructions and my laws in all my appointments, they shall watch; and my Sabbaths shall they consecrate.
And to a dead man they shall not come to be defiled: but for father and for mother, and for son and for daughter, for brother, for sister who was not to a husband, they shall be defiled.
And after his cleansing they shall number to him seven days.
And in the day of his going into the holy place, to the inner court he serve in the holy place, he shall bring near his sin, says the Lord Jehovah.
And it was to them for an inheritance; I am their inheritance: and a possession ye shall not give to there in Israel: I am their possession.
The gift and the sin and the trespass shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be to them.
And the first of all the first-fruits of all, and every oblation of all from all your oblations, shall be for the priests: and the first of your grouts ye shall give to the priest to cause blessing to rest upon thy house.
Every carcass or torn from bind and from cattle, the priests shall not eat.
And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance, ye shall lift up an oblation to Jehovah, holiness from the land: the length, five and twenty thousand the length; and the breadth, ten thousand: it is holy in all its bounds round about.
There shall be from this to the holy place five hundred, by five being square round about; and fifty cubits the area to it round about.
And from this measure thou shalt measure the length, five and twenty thousand, and the breadth, ten thousand: and in it shall be the holy plate, the holy of holies.
A holy place from the land this shall be to the priests serving the holy place drawing near to serve Jehovah: and it was to them a place for their houses and a holy place for the holy place.
And five and twenty thousand the length, and ten thousand the breadth, shall be to the Levites serving the house to them for a possession of twenty cells.
And ye shall give the possession of the city, five thousand the breadth, and the length, five and twenty thousand, over against the oblation of the holy place: it shall be to all the house of Israel.
And for the prince from this, and from this to the oblation of the holy place, and to the possession of the city, at the face of the oblation of the holy place, and at the face of the possession of the city from the side of the sea, the ass, and from the side of the east to the east: and the length over against one of the portions from the bound of the sea to the bound of the east,
In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you, O princes of Israel: remove ye violence and oppression, and do judgment and justice, lift up your expulsions from off my people, says the Lord Jehovah.
A just balance, and a just ephah, and a just bath, shall be to you.
The ephah and the bath shall be one measure, for the bath to lift up the tenth of the homer, and the ephah the tenth of the homer: to the homer shall it be from its measure.
And the shekel twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels the maneh shall be to you.
This the oblation which ye shall lift up: the sixth of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and give the sixth of an ephah of an homer of barley.
And the law of oil, the bath of oil, the tenth of the bath from the cor, ten baths the homer, for ten baths are the homer.
And one sheep from the flock out of two hundred, out of the well watered region of Israel, for a gift and for the burnt-offering, and for the peace to expiate for them, says the Lord Jehovah.
All the people of the land shall be for this oblation for the prince in Israel.
And for the prince it shall be the burnt-offerings, and the gift, and the libation, in the festivals and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, and in all the appointments of the house of Israel: he shall do the sin, and the gift, and the burnt-offering, and the peace to expiate for the house of Israel.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the first, in one to the month, thou shalt take a bullock, son of a cow, blameless, and cleanse the holy place:
And the priest took of the blood of the sin and gave upon the door-posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the terrace, to the altar and upon the door-posts of the gate of the inner enclosure.
And thus shalt thou do in the seventh to the month, from each going astray and from the simple: and ye expiated the house.
In the first, in the fourteenth day in the month, the passover shall be to you the festival of seven days; unleavened shall be eaten.
And in that day the prince did for himself and for all the people of the land the bullock of sin.
And seven days of the festival he shall do a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks and seven rams blameless for the day, seven days; and the sin a he goat of the goats for the day.
And the gift an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram shall he do, and oil, an hin to the ephah.
In the seventh, in the fifteenth day to the month, in the festival shall he do according to these things, seven days, according to the sin, according to the burnt-offering; and according to the gift and according to the oil.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner enclosure turning to the east shall be shut six days of work; and in the day of the Sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
And the prince went in the way of the porch of the gate from without, and he stood by the door-posts of the gate, and the priests did his burnt-offerings and his peace, and he worshiped upon the threshold of the gate, and he went forth: and the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
And the people of the land worshiped at the door of that gate in the Sabbaths and in the new moons, before Jehovah.
And the burnt-offering which the prince shall bring near to Jehovah in the day of the Sabbath, six blameless lambs, and a blameless ram.
And the gift an ephah to a ram, a gift for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an hin to the ephah
And in the day of the new moon, a blameless bullock, the son of a cow, and six lambs and a ram: they shall be blameless.
And an ephah to the bullock and an ephah to a ram shall he do the gift, and to the lambs, according as his hand shall attain, and the oil, an hin to the ephah.
And in the going in of the prince he shall go in the way of the porch of the gate, and in its way he shall go forth.
And In the going in of the people of the land before Jehovah in the appointments, he going in the way of the gate of the north to worship, shall come forth the way of the gate of the south; and he going in the way of the gate of the south, shall come forth the way of the gate of the north: he shall not turn back the way which he came in it, but he shall come forth opposite to it.
And the prince in the midst of them, in their going in, shall go in; and in their going forth, his going forth.
And in the festivals and in the appointments the gift shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an bin to the ephah.
And when the prince shall do a voluntary gift of a burnt-offering or peace a voluntary gift to Jehovah, and he opened to him the gate turning to the east, and he did his burnt-offering and his peace according as he will do in the day of the Sabbath: and he went forth and shut the gate after his going forth.
And a blameless lamb the son of his year thou shalt do for a burnt-offering for the day to Jehovah: in the morning, by the morning, shalt thou do it.
And thou shalt do the gift for it in the morning by the morning, the sixth of an ephah, and the oil, the third of an hin, to sprinkle the fine flour; a gift to Jehovah a law forever, continually.
And prepare ye the lamb and the gift, and the oil, in the morning, by the morning, a burnt-offering continually.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If the prince shall give a gift to a man of his sons, of his inheritance, it shall be to his sons; this their possession by inheritance.
And if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, and it was to him until the year of liberty; and it turned back to the prince: but his inheritance his sons'; to them it shall be.
And the prince shall not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them, from their possession; from his possession he shall cause his sons to inherit, so that my people shall not be scattered each from his possession.
And he will bring me through the entrance which is by the shoulder of the gate, into the cells of the holy place, to the priests, turning to the north: and behold, there a place upon the two thighs of the sea.
And he will say to me, This the place where the priests shall boil there the trespass and the sin, where they shall cook the gift; not to bring forth to the enclosure without to consecrate the people.
And he will bring me forth to the enclosure without, and he will cause me to pass through to the four angles of the enclosure; and behold, an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure; an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure.
In the four angles of the enclosure, enclosures shut up, forty the length and thirty the breadth: one measure to these four angles.
And a wall round about in them, round about to them four, and boiling places made from under the walls round about.
And he will say to me, These the house of those boiling where those serving the house shall boil there the sacrifice of the people.
And he will turn me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters coming forth from under the threshold of the house to the east: for the face of the house eastward, and the waters coming down from under from the right shoulder of the house, from the south to the altar.
And he will bring me forth the way of the gate of the north; and he will turn me round the way without to the gate without the way looking to the east; and behold, waters flowing from the right shoulder.
And in the going forth of the man eastward, and the line in his hand, and he will measure a thousand by the cubit, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the soles.
And he will measure a thousand, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the knees. And he will measure a thousand, and cause me to pass through; the Waters of the loins.
And he will measure a thousand, a torrent which I shall not be able to pass through: for the waters rose, waters of swimming, a torrent which shall not be passed through.
And he will say to me, Didst thou see, son of man? And he will cause me to go, and he will turn me back upon the lip of the torrent.
In my turning back, and behold, upon the lip of the torrent very much wood from here and from them.
And he will say to me, These waters going forth to the circuit of the east, and they went down to Arabia and came into the sea: being brought forth to the sea and the waters were healed.
And it was every living soul that shall creep, to all where the two torrents shall come there, shall live: and there was very many fish, because these waters came there: and they shall be healed and all lived where the torrent shall come there.
And it was the fisherman shall stand upon it from the fountain of the kid, even to the fountain of the two calves; they shall be a spreading for nets; their fish shall be according to its kind as the fish of the great sea very many.
Its marshes and its pools and they shall not be healed; they were given marshes to salt.
And upon the torrent shall come up upon its lip, from hence and from thence, every tree of food, its leaf shall not fade, and its fruit shall not be consumed: for its months it shall bear early fruit, for its waters from the holy place they come forth: and its fruits were for food and its leaf for medicine.
Thus said the Lord Jehovah: This the bound by which ye shall inherit the land for the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph two portions.
And ye inherited it, each as his brother: which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land fell to you in inheritance.
And this the bound of the land to the side of the north from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, to go to Zedad.
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the bound of Damascus and between the bound of Hamath; the middle enclosure which is to the bound of Hauran.
And the bound from the sea was the enclosure of fountains, the hound of Damascus, and the north northward, and the bound of Hamath: And the side of the north.
And the side of the east from between Hauran and from between Damascus, and from between Gilead and from between the land of Israel, Jordan, from the bound to the east sea shall ye measure: and the east side.
And the south side southward from Tamar even to the waters of contradiction in Kadesh, the torrent to the the great sea: and the south side south
And the side of the sea the great sea from the bound, even to over against the entrance of Hamath. This the side of the sea.
And ye divided that land to you for the tribes of Israel.
And ye shall cause it to fall in inheritance to you, and to the strangers sojourning in the midst of you, who begat sons in the midst of you: and they were to you as the nation among the sons of Israel with you they shall fall in the inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
And it was in the tribe which the stranger sojourned with it there shall ye give his inheritance, says the Lord Jehovah.
And these the names of the tribes: From the extremity north to the hand of the way of Hethlon to go to Hamath, the enclosure of the fountain, the bound of Damascus northward to the hand of Hamath, and they were to him the east side, the sea, Dan, one.
And upon the bound of Dan from the side east even to the side of the sea, Asher, one.

And upon the bound of Reuben from the side east even to the side of the sea, Judah, one.
And upon the bound of Judah from the side east even to the side of the sea, shall be the oblation which ye shall lift up, five and twenty thousand the breadth, and the length as one of the portions from the side east, even to the side of the sea: and the holy place was in the midst of it.
The oblation which ye shall lift up to Jehovah, the length, five and twenty thousand, and the breadth, ten thousand.
And to these shall be the holy oblation to the priests; the north, five and: twenty thousand, and to the sea, the breadth ten thousand, and eastward, the breadth ten thousand, and to the south, the length five and twenty thousand, and the holy place of Jehovah was in: the midst of it.
To the priests being consecrated: of the sons of Zadok, who watched my watches, who went not astray in the going astray of the sons of Israel, as the Levites went astray.
And the oblation from the oblation of the land shall be to them holy of holies to the bound of the Levites.
And the Levities over against the bound of the priests, five and twenty thousand the length, and the breadth ten thousand: all the length five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
And they shall not sell from it and it shall not be exchanged, and he shall not cause the first-fruits to pane away, for it is holy to Jehovah.
And the five thousand being left in the breadth upon the face of the five and twenty thousand, this profane the city for dwelling and for an area, and the city was in the midst of it.
And these its measures: the side north, five hundred and four thousand, and the south side five hundred and four thousand, and from the side east five hundred and four thousand, and the side of the sea, five hundred and four thousand.
And the area was to the city northward, fifty and two hundred, and south, fifty and two hundred, and east, fifty and two hundred, and the sea, fifty and two hundred.
And the remainder in the length over against the oblation of holiness, ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand to the sea: and it was over against the oblation of the holy place; and its Produce was for bread to the servants of the city.
And serving the city they shall serve it from all the tribes of Israel.
All the oblation five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: four square ye shall lift up the oblation of holiness for a possession of the city.
And the remainder to the prince, from hence and from thence to the oblation of the holy place, and to the possession of the city at the face of five and twenty thousand of the oblation even to the bound eastward, and the sea, upon the face of five and twenty thousand upon the bound of the sea, over against the portions to the prince: and it was the oblation of holiness; and the holy place of the house in the midst of it.
From the possession of the Levites from the possession of the city, in the midst of that to the prince, it shall be between the bound of Judah and between the bound of Benjamin, to the prince it shall be.
And the rest of the tribes, from the side east even to the side of the sea, Benjamin, one.
And upon the bound of Benjamin from the side east even to the side of the sea, Simeon, one.

This the land which ye shall cause to fall for inheritance to the tribes of Israel, and these their portions, says the Lord Jehovah.
And these the goings out of the city from the side north, five hundred and four thousand the measure.
And the gates of the city for the names of the tribes of Israel, three gates north; the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.

In the third year to the kingdom of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel to Jerusalem, and he will press it.
And Jehovah will give Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and from the number of vessels of the house of God: and he will bring them to the land of Shinar the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.
And the king will say to Ashpenaz the leader of his eunuchs to bring from the sons of Israel and from the seed royal, and from the nobles;
Children whom not any blemish in them, and good of aspect, and understanding in all wisdom, and knowing knowledge, and understanding intelligence, and to whom power in them to stand in the king's temple, and to teach them the writing and tongue of the chaldees.
And the king will allot to them the word of a day in its day from the king's dainties and from the wine of his drinking: and to nourish them three years, and from the end of three years they shall stand before the king.
And there will be among them from the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hansniah, Mishael, and Azariah.
And the chief of the eunuchs will set names to them: to David, Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, Shadrach; and to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.
And Daniel will set up upon his heart that he will not be defiled with the dainties of the king, and with the wine of his drinking: and he will seek from the chief of the eunuchs that he shall not defile himself.
And God will give Daniel to mercy and compassion before the chiefs of the eunuchs.
And the chief of the eunuchs will say to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who allotted your food and your drink: for wherefore shall he see your faces gloomy above the children as of your age? and make my head guilty to the King.
And Daniel will say to Melzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
Prove now thy servants, ten days; and they shall give to us from seed herbs, and we will eat, and water, and we will drink.
And our aspects shall be seen before thee, and the aspect of the children eating the king's dainties: and according to what thou shalt see, do with thy servants.
And he wilt hear to them for this word, and he will try them ten days.
And from the end of ten days their aspect was seen good and fat of flesh above all the children eating of the king's dainties.
And Melzar will be taking away their dainties, and the wine of their drinking, and he gave to them seed herbs.
And these four children, God gave to them knowledge and understanding in all writing and wisdom: and Daniel understood in every vision and dreams.
And from the end of the days when the king said to bring them in, and the chief of the eunuchs will bring them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
And the king will speak with them: and there was not found from all of them as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they will stand before the king.
And every word of the wisdom of understanding which the king sought from them, and he will find them ten hands over all the sacred scribes, the enchanters which were in all his kingdom.
And Daniel will be even to one year to Cyrus the king.
And in the second year to the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, and his spirit will be moved, and his sleep was broken upon him.
And the king will say to call to the sacred scribes, and to the enchanters, and to the sorcerers, and to the Chaldeans, to announce to the king his dreams. And they will come and stand before the king.
And the king will say to them, I dreamed a dream, and my spirit will be moved to know the dream.
And the Chaldeans will speak to the king Syriac: O king, live forever: say to thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The word went out from me: if ye will not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, ye shall be made pieces, and your houses shall be set dung-hills.
And if ye shall show the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive from before me a gift and present, and great honor: therefore shove me the dream and its interpretation.
They answered a second time, and said, The king will say to his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation.
And the king answered and said, Certainly I know that ye buy the time, for which cause that ye saw that the word went out from me.
Enough if ye will not make known to me the dream, this one edict for you; and ye divided out the word of falsehood and this corruption to say before me, till that the time shall change: therefore say to me the dream and I shall know that ye will show me its interpretation.
The Chaldean answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the dry land that shall be able to show the king's word: for which cause that every king, leader, and ruler, asked not a word like this to any sacred scribe, and enchanter, and Chaldean.
And the word the king asked will be made rare, and there is not another that will show it before the king except the gods that their dwelling is not with flesh.
For this cause the king was indignant and greatly angry, and he spake to destroy to all the wise of Babel.
And the edict went forth and the wise men being killed; and they sought Daniel and his associates to be killed.
At that time Daniel turned back counsel and reason to Arioch, leader of the king's executioners, that went forth to kill to the wise of Babel:
He answered and said to Arioch the king's ruler, For what the severe edict from before the king? Then Arioch made known the word to Daniel.
And Daniel went up and sought from the king that he will give time for it, and to show to the king the interpretation.
Then Daniel departed to his house, and made known the word to Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah his companions:
And for seeking companions from before the God of the heavens concerning this secret: that Daniel and his companions shall not be destroyed with the rest of the wise of Babel.
Then to Daniel in a vision of the night was the secret uncovered. Then Daniel praised to the God of the heavens.
Daniel answered and said, For this the name of God being praised from forever and even to forever: for wisdom and strength are to him:
And he changes the times and the seasons; removing kings and setting up kings; giving wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those knowing understanding.
He uncovered deep and hidden things: he knew what in darkness, and light lodged with him.
For thee, O God of my fathers, I praise and laud that thou gavest me wisdom and strength, and now didst make known to me what we sought from thee: for thou didst make known to us the king's word.
For this cause Daniel went up to Arioch whom the king allotted to destroy the wise of Babel: he went and said thus to him: For the wise of Babel thou shalt not destroy: bring me up before the king, and I will show the interpretation to the king.
Then with haste Arioch brought up for Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, That I found a man from the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known to the king the interpretation.
The king answered and said to Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, Is it to thee to be able to make known to me the dream that I saw, and its interpretation?
Daniel answered before the king, and said, The secret that the, king asked, not the wise men, the enchanters, the sacred scribes, the diviners, shall be able to show to the king;
But there is a God in the heavens revealing secrets, and he made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what to be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, it is thus:
Thou, O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed went up what to be after this: and he revealing secrets made known to thee what to be.
And I not for wisdom that is in me more than all living is this secret revealed to me, but for the reason that they shall make known the interpretation to the king, and thou shalt know the thoughts of thy heart.
Thou, O king, wert seeing, and behold, one great image. This image vast, and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its aspect terrible.
This image, its head of good gold, the breasts and arms of silver, and the bowels and thighs of brass:
The legs of iron, the feet part of iron, and part of burnt clay.
Thou wert seeing even till a stone was cut out not with hands, and striking against the image upon the feet of iron and burnt clay, and breaking them in pieces.
At that time were beaten small at once, the iron, the burnt clay, the brass, the silver and the gold, and they were as the chaff of the threshing-floor of summer; and the wind lifted them up and all place was not found for them: and the stone striking against the image was for a great rock, and filled all the earth.
This the dream, and we will tell its interpretation before the king.
Thou, O king, a king of kings: for the God of the heavens gave to thee a kingdom strong and powerful, and splendid.
And in all that the sons of men dwelt, the beasts of the open field and the birds of the heavens he gave into thine hand, and gave thee power over them all Thou this head of gold.
And after thee shall arise another kingdom lower than thee, and another third kingdom of brass, that shall have power over all the earth.
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, because that iron beats small, and makes thin all: and as iron breaks all these, it shall beat small and break.
And that thou sawest the feet and toes, part of burnt clay of the potter, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; and from the firmness of iron to be in it, for which cause that thou sawest iron mingled with earthen-ware.
And the toes of the feet, part of iron, and part of burnt clay, from the end of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be cut asunder.
That thou sawest the iron mingled with the earthen-ware, mingling for themselves with the seed of men: and not cleaving to them this with this, so as iron not mingling with burnt clay.
And in their days that they are kings, the God of the heavens shall set up a kingdom that shall not be destroyed forever: and its kingdom shall be left to another people; it shall beat small and destroy all these kingdoms, and this shall stand forever.
Because that thou sawest that the stone being cut from the rock not with hands, and it beat small the iron, the brass, the burnt clay, the silver and the gold: the great God made known to the king what to be after this: and the dream certain, and its interpretation faithful.
At that time king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out a gift and sweet odors to him.
And the king answered to Daniel, and said, of a truth that your God he is God of gods, and Lord of kings, and revealing secrets, that thou wert able to reveal this secret.
Then the king multiplied to Daniel, and gave to him many a great gift, and gave him power over all the province of Babel, and chief of the prefects over all the wise of Babel.
And Daniel sought from the king, and he appointed out over the business of the province of Babel to Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego: and Daniel in the gate of the king.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold; its height sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits: he set it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babel.
And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together to the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, those skilled in law, the lawyers, and all the rulers of the provinces, to the drinking to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
At that time there being gathered together the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the chief judges, the treasurers, those skilled in law, the lawyers and all the rulers of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up; and standing before the image that Nebuchadnezzar set up.
And a herald called with strength, To you they say, O peoples, nations, and tongues,
In the time ye shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, ye shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
And whoever shall not fall and prostrate himself in the same moment, he shall be cast into a furnace of flaming fire.
For this cause in that time that all peoples heard the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, and all sorts of music, all peoples, nations, and tongues, fell prostrating themselves to the image of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.
For this cause, at that time men of the Chaldeans drew near and ate up the Jews piece meal.
They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live forever.
Thou, O king, didst set an edict, that every man that shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery and the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, shall fall and prostrate himself to the image of gold:
And whoever shall not fall and prostrate himself shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of flaming fire.
There are men, Jews, that thou didst appoint over the business of the province of Babel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men set not an account to thee, O king: they served not to thy gods; and to the image of gold that thou didst set up they prostrated themselves not.
At that time Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath, said to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, Is it on purpose O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed Nego, ye not serving to my gods, and to the image of gold that I set up, ye not prostrating yourselves?
Now if ye being prepared that in the time that ye shall hear the voice of the horn, the pipe, the harp, the lyre, the psaltery, and the bagpipe, and all sorts of music, ye shall fall and prostrate yourselves to the image that I made; and if ye shall not prostrate yourselves in the same moment, ye shall be cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire; and who that God that shall deliver you from my hands?
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego answered, and saying to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we need not to turn back to thee upon this word.
If it is, our God whom we served will be able to deliver us from the furnace of flaming fire, and from thy hand, O king, he will deliver us.
And if not, it shall be made known to thee, O king, that to thy gods we serve not, and to the image of gold that thou didst set up we will not prostrate ourselves:
In that time Nebuchadnezzar being filled with wrath, and the form of the visage was changed to him against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego: he answered and said to heat to the furnace one seven times above that it was seen to be heated.
To the strong, the strong of strength that were in his army, he said to bind to Shadrach, Mesbach, and Abed-Nego, to cast into the furnace of flaming fire.
Then these men were bound in their wide trowsers, their tunics, and their mantles, and their clothing, and were cast into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire.
For this cause, as the word of the king being severe, and the furnace exceedingly heated, these men that took up to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, the flame of fire killed them.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, fell into the midst of the furnace of flaming fire, bound.
At that time Nebuchadnezzar the king was grieved, and rose up in haste; he answered and said to the counselors, Did we not cast three men into the midst of the fire, bound? They answering and saying to the king, True, O king.
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose going about in the midst of the fire, and there is no hurt in them: and the aspect of the fourth like to the Son of God.
At that time Nebuchadnezzar drew near to the door of the furnace of flaming fire; he answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, ye servants of God most high, go forth, and come. Then came forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, from the midst of the fire.
And there being gathered together the satraps, the prefects, and governors, and the king's counselors, looking upon these men that upon their bodies the fire had no power, and a hair of their head was not singed, and their wide trowsers were not changed, and the smell of fire passed not upon them.
Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, Blessed be their God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, who sent his messenger and delivered for his servants that trusted upon him, and they changed the king's word, and gave their bodies that they will not serve and prostrate themselves to any god, except to their God.
And an edict being set from me, That every people, nation and tongue, that shall say an error against their God, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, shall be made pieces, and his house shall be set a dung-hill, because that there is no other God that shall be able to deliver according to this.
Then the king caused to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, to prosper in the province of Babel.
Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations and tongues, that dwell in all the earth, your peace shall become great.
The signs and wonders that the most high God made with me, it was pleasant before me to show.
His signs, how many! and his wonders, how mighty! his kingdom, an eternal kingdom, and his dominion with generation and generation.
I Nebuchadnezzar, was secure in my house, and green in my temple:
I saw a dream, and it will terrify me; and the conceptions upon my bed and the visions of my head, will cause me to tremble.
And an edict being set from me to bring up before me to all the wise of Babel, that they shall make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
At that time the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners, coming in: and I told the dream before them: and its interpretation they making not known to me.
And even at last Daniel came up before me, whose name Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods in him: and before him I told the dream:
O Belteshazzar, leader of the sacred scribes, for I knew that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and my secret pressed not upon thee; the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation, say thou.
And the visions of my head upon my bed; I was seeing, and lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height great.
And the tree increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to the end of all the earth:
Its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it: and the beasts of the open field will be shaded under it, the buds of the heavens will dwell in its boughs, and all flesh will be nourished from it.
I was seeing in the visions of my head upon my bed, and lo, a watcher and holy one came down from the heavens;
He called with strength, and thus he said, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit: the beasts shall flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the open field; and in the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and its portion with the beasts in the green herb of the earth.
Its heart shall be changed from man, and the heart of a beast shall be given to it; and seven times shall pass over him.
The word by the decree of the watchers, and the saying of the holy ones is the question: for the reason that the living shall know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it, and he will raise up over it the low of men.
This dream, I king Nebuchadnezzar saw. And thou Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, because that all the wise of my kingdom not being able to make known to me the interpretation: and thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
Then Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, was astonished for one moment, and his thoughts terrified him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, the dream and its interpretation shall not terrify thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream to those hating thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies.
The tree that thou sawest that increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to all the earth,
And its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it; under it the beast of the open field will dwell, and in its branches the birds of the heavens will dwell:
It is thou, O king, who increased and wert strong: and thy greatness increased and reached to the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
And that the king saw a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens, and said, Hew down the tree and destroy it; but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the open field; and with the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and with the beasts of the open field its portion, even till seven times shall pass over him;
This the interpretation, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, that came upon my lord the king:
And for thee driving from men, and with the beasts of the open field to be thy dwelling, and they shall feed to thee grass as oxen, and wetting to thee from the dew of the heavens, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it.
And that they said to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom being sure to thee, from when thou shalt know that the heavens rule.
Wherefore, O king, my counsel shall be pleasant to thee, and break off thy sins by justice, and thine iniquities in compassionating the poor; if it shall be a lengthening to thy peace.
All came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.
At the end of twelve months in the temple of the kingdom of Babel, he was going about.
The king answered and said, Is not this great Babel, that I built it for the house of the kingdom by the strength of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
Yet the word in the king's mouth, a voice from the heavens fell to thee, being said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom passed away from thee:
And from men driving thee out, and with beasts of the open field thy dwelling: and they shall feed to thee the grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will give it.
In the same moment the word was added upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven out from men, and he shall eat the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body shall be wet till that his hair was increased as eagles, and his nails as birds'.
And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes to the heavens, and my knowledge will turn back to me, and I praised to the Most High, and to him living forever, I praised and honored, whose dominion an eternal dominion, and his kingdom with generation and generation.
And all the generations of the earth being reckoned as nothing: and doing according to his station in the army of the heavens, and the generations of the earth: and there is none that shall strike upon his hand, and say to him, What didst thou?
In that time my knowledge will turn back to me: and for the honor of my kingdom, my splendor and my brightness will return to me; and my counselors and my nobles will seek to me: and I was established over my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.
Now I Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor to the king of the heavens, that all his works are truth, and his paths judgment: and that they going about in pride, he being able to bring low.
Belshazzar the king made great food for a thousand of his nobles, and before the thousand he drank wine.
Belshazzar said, in tasting the wine, to bring in for the vessels of gold and silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father brought forth from the temple that was in Jerusalem; and in them the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines, will drink.
At that time they brought the vessels of gold that were brought forth from the temple of the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and in them they drank, the king and his nobles, his wives and his concubines.
They drank wine, and praised to the gods of gold and silver, brass, iron, wood and stone.
In the same moment went forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote before the candlestick upon the lime of the wall of the temple of the king: and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote.
The king's brightnesses changing, and his thoughts will terrify him, and the knots of his loins breaking forth, and his knees knocked this upon that.
The king called with strength to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans and the diviners. The king answered and said to the wise of Babel, Whatever man that shall read this writing, and will show to me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and shall rule the third in the kingdom.
Then came in all the king's wise ones: and they were not able to read the writing, and to make known the interpretation to the king.
Then king Belshazzar being greatly terrified, and his brightnesses being changed upon him, and his nobles being perplexed.
The queen, on account of the king's words and his nobles', came in to the house of drinking: the queen answered and said, O king, live forever: thy thought shall not terrify thee, and thy brightnesses shall not be changed:
There is a man in thy kingdom that the spirit of the holy gods in him; and in the days of thy father, his light and his understanding and wisdom according to the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king thy father, set him up leader of the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, the diviners:
Because that an excellent spirit and knowledge, and his understanding interpreting dreams, and showing of enigmas, and solving knotty questions, was found in him, in Daniel whom the king set his name Belteshazzar: now Daniel shall be called, and he will show the interpretation.
At that time Daniel came in before the king. The king answered and said to Daniel, Is it thou, Daniel, which is from the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought from Judah?
I heard concerning thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and his light and his understanding and excellent wisdom was found in thee.
And now the wise ones, the enchanters, were brought in before me that they shall read this writing, and to make known to me its interpretation: and they were not able to show the interpretation of the word:
And I heard concerning thee, that thou wilt be able to interpret interpretations, and solve knotty questions: now if thou shalt be able to read the writing, and to make known to me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed in purple, and a necklace of gold upon thy neck, and thou shalt rule the third in the kingdom.
At that time Daniel answered and said before the king, Thy gifts to be to thyself, and give thy presents to another; but I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
Thou, O king, God most high gave a kingdom and greatness and honor and splendor to Nebuchadnezzar thy father:
And from the greatness that he gave to him, all peoples, nations and tongues, were trembling and fearing from before him: whom he was willing he killed; and whom he was willing, he was saving alive; and whom be was willing, he was setting up; and whom he willed he was humbling.
And when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was strong for pride, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom, and they took away his honor from him.
And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made level with the beasts, and with wild asses his dwelling: they will feed him with the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body will be wet; till that he knew that God the Most High ruled in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will set up over it.
And thou his son, O Belshazzar, didst not humble thy heart because that thou knewest all this;
And against the Lord of the heavens thou didst lift up thyself; and for the vessels of his house they brought before thee, and thou and thy nobles, and thy wives, and thy concubines, drinking wine in them; and to the gods of silver and gold, brass, iron, wood, and stone, who see not, and hear not, and know not, thou didst praise: and to the God whom thy breath in his hand, and all thy ways to him, thou didst not honor.
At that time from before him was sent the palm of the hand, and this writing written.
And this the writing that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PHARSIN.
This the interpretation of the word: Mene; God numbered thy kingdom and completed it.
Tekel; Thou shalt be weighed in the balances and be found wanting.
Pharsin; Thy kingdom was divided, and it shall be given to the Medes and to Persia.
At that time Belshazzar said, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and a necklace of gold upon his neck, and they cried out concerning him, for him to rule the third in the kingdom.
In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was killed.
And Darius the Median received the kingdom, as the son of two and sixty years.
It pleased before Darius and he set up over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, whom to be over all the kingdom;
And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was one: that to them the satraps giving to them account, and the king not for him detriment.
Then this Daniel excelling above the presidents and satraps because that an excellent spirit was in him; and the king doing to set him up over all the kingdom.
Then the presidents and satraps were seeking to find a pretext against Daniel from the part of the kingdom; and they will not be able to find any pretext and corruption, because that he was faithful, and any error and corruption was not found upon him.
Then these men saying that, We shall not find against this Daniel any pretext except we shall find against him in the law of his God.
Then these presidents and satraps ran together with tumult to the king, and saying thus to him, O Darius the king, live thou forever.
All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects and satraps, and counselors and governors, will counsel together to set up a statute of the kingdom, and to make strong an interdict that whoever shall seek a request from any God and man even to thirty days, except from thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
Now, O king, wilt thou set up the interdict, and sign the writing, that not to be changed according to the law of Media and Persia, which shall not pass away.
For this cause, king Darius signed the writing and the interdict.
And Daniel as soon as he knew that the writing was signed, went up into his house; and the windows being opened to him in his upper chambers before Jerusalem, three times in the day he kneeled upon his knees, and praying and praising before his God, for the cause that he did from before this.
Then these men ran together with tumult and found Daniel seeking and making supplication before his God.
At that time they drew near, and saying before the king concerning the interdict of the king, Didst thou not sign an interdict that every man that shall seek from any God and man even for thirty days, except from thee, O King, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The word is certain, according to the law of Media and Persia, that shall not pass away.
At that time they answered, and saying before the king, That Daniel that is from the sons of the captivity of Judah set not up an account to thee, O king, and to the interdict that thou didst sign; and three times in the day he sought his requests.
Then the king as soon as he heard the word, was greatly displeased with himself, and upon Daniel he set the heart to set him free: and even to the going down of the sun he was exerting himself to deliver him.
At that time these men ran together with tumult to the king, and saying to the king, Know, O king, that the law to Media and Persia is, that every interdict and statute that the king shall set up is not to be changed.
At that time the king said, and they brought Daniel and cast into the den of the lions; the king answered and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest to him continually, he will set thee free.
And one stone was brought and set upon the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his signet ring, and with the signet ring of his nobles, that the will shall not be changed upon Daniel.
Then the king departed to his temple and passed the night fasting: and he brought not his concubines before him, and his sleep fled from him.
At that time the king will rise in the dawn in the morning, and in haste he departed to the lion's den.
And in his drawing near to the den he cried to Daniel with a strong voice, the king answered and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, thy God whom thou servest to him continually, is he able to set thee free from the lion's den?
Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever.
My God sent his messenger and shut the mouth of the lions, and they hurt me not, for the cause that innocence was found to me; and also before thee, O king, I did no hurt.
At that time the king rejoiced greatly for him, and to Daniel he said to be taken up from the den. And Daniel was taken up from the den, and any hurt was not found upon him, for he trusted in his God.
And the king said, and they brought these men that ate up Daniel piece meal, and cast into the lion's den, them, their sons, and their wives; and they not down to the bottom of the den even till the lions had power over them, and they broke all their bones in pieces.
At that time Darius the king wrote all peoples, nations and tongues, that are dwelling in all the earth, Your peace shall be great.
From before me a decree was set forth that in every dominion of my kingdom to be trembling and fearing from before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and standing forever, and his kingdom that shall not be destroyed, and his dominion even to the end.
Setting free and delivering, and working signs and wonders in the heavens and upon the earth, that set free to Daniel from the hand of the lions.
And this Daniel was prospered in the kingdom of Darius, and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.
In one year to Belshazzar the king of Babel, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: at that time he wrote the dream, telling the head of the words.
Daniel answered and said, I was seeing in my vision by night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens rushing forth to the great sea.
And four great beasts went up from the sea, different this from this.
The first as a lion, and the wings of an eagle to it; I was seeing even till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and upon its feet it was caused to stand as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.
And lo, another beast, a second being like to a bear; and it rose up to one side, and three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and saying to it thus, Arise, eat much flesh.
After this I was seeing, and lo, another, as a panther, and to it four wings of a bird upon its back, and four heads to the beast; and dominion was given to it.
After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, fearful, and strong and powerful exceedingly; and great teeth of iron to it, eating and beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet: and it being different from all the beasts that were before it; and ten horns to it.
I was considering upon the horns, and lo, another little horn went up among them, and three from the first horns were plucked up from before it: and lo, eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.
I was seeing even till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days sat, his garment white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wool: his throne a flame of fire, his wheels a burning fire.
A river of fire flowed and went out from before him: thousands of thousands will wait upon him, and myriads of myriads will stand before him: the tribunal sat, and the books were opened.
I was seeing at that time from the voice of the great words that the horn was speaking: I was seeing even till that the beast was killed and its body destroyed, and it was given to the burning fire.
And the rest of the beasts they took away their power: and length in life was given to them for a season and time.
I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the clouds of the heavens as the Son of man he came, and turning even to the Ancient of days; and they brought him near before him.
And to him was given dominion, power and honor, and a kingdom; and all peoples and nations and tongues shall serve to him: his power an eternal power that shall not pass away, and his kingdom which shall not be destroyed.
I Daniel was grieved in the midst of the sheath, and the visions of my heart will terrify me.
I drew near to one of those standing by, and I sought from him the truth concerning all this: and he said to me, and he will cause me to know the interpretation of the words.
Those great beasts that they are four, four kings they shall rise up from the earth.
And the holy ones of the Most High shall take the kingdom and shall possess the kingdom even to forever, and even to forever of forever.
Then I willed to speak the truth concerning the fourth beast that was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, its teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass; eating, beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet;
And concerning the ten horns that were upon its head, and the other that went up, and three fell from before it; and this horn and eyes to it, and a mouth speaking great things, and its sight great above its companions.
I was seeing, and this horn made an encounter with the holy ones, and prevailed against them;
Even till that the Ancient of days came, and the judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High; and the time extending and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.
Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom in the earth, that shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall eat up all the earth, and shall tread it down and beat it.
And the ten horns from this kingdom, ten kings shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be different from the first, and he shall humble three kings.
And he shall speak words against the Most High, and he shall vex the holy ones of the Most High, and he will hope to change times and law: and they shall be given into his hand even to a time and times, and the dividing of time.
And the tribunal sat, and they shall take away his power to cut off and to destroy even to the end.
And the kingdom and the power, and the greatness of the kingdom under All the heavens was given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High his kingdom an eternal kingdom, and all powers shall serve to him, and shall hear.
Even to this the end of the word. I Daniel, my thoughts will greatly terrify me, and my brightness will be changed upon me: and I kept the word in my heart.
In the third year to the kingdom of Belshazzar the king a vision was seen to me, I Daniel, after that being seen to me in the beginning.
And I shall see in a vision; and it will be in my seeing, and I in Shushan the fortress, in Elam the province; and I shall see in a vision, and I was by the stream of strength.
And I shall lift up mine eyes, and I shall see, and behold, one ram stood before the stream, and horns to him: and the horns high; and the one high above the second, and the high came up at the last.
And I saw the ram pushing the sea, and north and south; and all the beasts will not stand before him, and none delivering from his hand; and he did according to his will, and increased.
And I was considering, and behold, a he goat of the goats came from the west upon the face of all the earth, and not touching upon the earth: and the he goat a horn of vision between his eyes.
And ha will come even to the ram possessing the horns, which I saw standing before the stream, and he will run against him in the wrath of his power.
And I saw him coming near to the ram, and he will be exasperated against him, and he will strike the ram and break his two horns: and there will be no power in the ram to stand before him, and he will cast him to the earth, and will tread upon him: and there was none delivering for the ram out of his hand.
And the he goat of the goats increased even greatly: and in his being strong the great horn was broken; and there will come up the vision of four underneath it to the four winds of the heavens.
And from one of them came forth one horn of a little thing, and it will be great exceedingly to the south to the sunrisings, and to the glories.
And it will be great even to the army of the heavens; and it will cast to the earth from the army, and from the stars, and it will tread them down.
And even to the chief of the army was he magnified, and from him the continuance was lifted up, and the foundation of his holy place was cast down.
And an army will be given upon the continuance by transgression, and it will cast down truth to the earth; and it did and it succeeded.
And I shall hear one holy one speaking, and one holy one will say to a certain one, speaking, How long the vision of the continuance, and the transgression laying waste, to be? and the holy place and the army being trodden down?
And he will say to me, Even to evening morning, two thousand and three hundred; and the holy place was justified.
And it will be in my seeing, I Daniel, the vision, and I shall seek its understanding, and behold, there stood before me as the sight of a man,
And I shall hear man's voice between Ulai, and he will call and say, Man of God, cause to this to understand the sight.
And he will come near my standing: and in his coming I was afraid, and I shall fall upon my face; and he will say to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end, the vision.
And in his speaking with me I lay in a deep sleep upon my face upon the earth: and he will touch upon me and will cause me to stand upon my standing.
And he will say, Behold me making known to thee what shall be in the last part of the wrath: for at the appointment, the end.
The ram which thou sawest possessing horns, the kings of Media and Persia.
And the hairy he goat, the king of Grecia: and the great horn which is between his eyes, he the first king.
And that being broken, and four will stand up underneath it, four kingdoms from the nation shall stand up, and not in his power.
And in the latter state of their kingdom as those transgressing being completed, a king strong of face and understanding enigmas, shall stand up.
And strong his power, and not in his power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and he prospered, and did, and he destroyed the strong ones and the holy people.
And by his intelligence and he caused deceit to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify in his heart, and in security he shall destroy many: and against the Chief of chiefs he shall stand; and without hand shall he be broken.
And the sight of the evening and the morning which was said, it is truth: and shut thou up the vision; for, for many days.
And I Daniel was, and was sick days; and I shall rise and do the works of the king; and I shall be astonished at the sight, and none understanding.
In one year to Darius son of Ahasuerus, from the seed of Media who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans.
In one year to the kingdom, I Daniel understood by books the number of years which the word of Jehovah was to Jeremiah the prophet, to fill up for the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years.
And I will give my face to Jehovah God to seek prayer and supplications, with fasting and sackcloth and ashes:
And I will pray to Jehovah my God, and I will confess and say, Ah, Jehovah, the great and dreadful God, watching the covenant and the mercy to those loving him, and to those watching his commands:
We sinned, and we did iniquity, and were evil, and rebelled, and departing from thy commands and from thy judgments.
And we heard not to thy servants the prophets who spake in thy name to our kings and our chiefs and our fathers, and to all the people of the earth.
To thee, O Jehovah, justice, and to us shame of face, as this day to the men of Judah, and to those dwelling in Jerusalem, and to all Israel being near and being far off, in all the lands where thou didst thrust them there in their transgression which they transgressed against thee.
O Jehovah, to us shame of face, to our kings, to our chiefs, and to our fathers, that we sinned against thee.
To Jehovah our God compassion and forgivenesses, for we rebelled against him.
We heard not to the voice of Jehovah our God to go in his laws which he gave before us in the hand of his servants the prophets.
And all Israel passed by thy Laws, and departing not to hear to thy voice; and the curse will be poured upon us, and the oath which was written in the law of Moses the servant of God, for we sinned against him.
And he will set up his words which he spake against us, and against our judges who judged us to bring against us a great evil: which was not done under all the heavens according to what was done in Jerusalem.
As that written in the law of Moses all this evil came upon us, and we supplicated not the face of Jehovah our God to turn back from our iniquities and to understand in thy truth.
And Jehovah will watch for evil, and will bring it upon us: for Jehovah our God is just upon all his works which he did: and we heard not to his voice.
And now, O Jehovah our God, who brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and thou wilt make to thee a name as this day; we sinned, we did evil.
O Jehovah, according to all thy justice, now shall thine anger be turned back, and thy wrath from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people for a reproach to all those round about us.
And now, O our God, hear to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy desolated holy place, for sake of Jehovah.
Incline, O my God, thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and see our desolations, and the city which thy name was called upon it: for not for our justice do we cause our supplications to fall before thee, but for thy many compassions.
O Jehovah hear; O Jehovah forgive; O Jehovah, attend and do; thou wilt not delay for thy sake, O my God: for thy name was called upon thy city and upon thy people.
And I yet speaking and praying and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people Israel, and causing my supplication to fall before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God;
And I yet speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I saw in the vision in the beginning, being wearied with weariness, touched upon me about the time of the evening gift.
And he will cause to understand, and will speak with me, and say, O Daniel, now came I forth to teach thee understanding.
In the beginning of thy supplications the word came forth, and I came to announce; for thou art desires: and understand thou in the word, and consider in the sight.
Seventy seventy were divided upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to close the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to expiate iniquity, and to bring in eternal justice, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies.
And thou shalt know and understand, from the going forth of the word to turn back and to build Jerusalem even to Messiah the leader, seventy weeks, and sixty and two weeks: and the street shall turn back and be built, and the ditch, in the trouble of the times.
And after sixty and two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, and not for him: and the people of the leader coming shall destroy the city and the holy place; and its end with an overflowing, and even to the end of the war desolations were determined.
And he made strong the covenant to many one week: and half the week he shall cause the sacrifice and gift to cease, and upon the wing of abominations laying waste, even to the completion, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolation.
In the third year to Cyrus king of Persia the word was revealed to Daniel, whom his name was called Belteshazzar; and the word truth, and the warfare great: and he understood the word, and understanding to him in the sight.
And in these days I Daniel was mourning three weeks of days.
Bread of desires I ate not, and flesh and wine came not into my mouth, and anointing, I did not anoint myself even to the filling up of three weeks of days.
And in the twenty and fourth day to the first month, and I was upon the hand of the great river, this is Hiddekel;
And I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, one man being clothed with linen garments, and his loins being girded with gold of Uphaz:
And his body as topaz, and his face as the sight of lightning, and his eyes as flames of fire, and his arms and his feet as the eye of polished brass, and the voice of his words as the voice of a multitude.
And I saw, I Daniel alone, the sight: and the men that were with me saw not the sight, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they will flee in hiding themselves.
And I was left alone, and I shall see this great sight, and strength was not left in me: and my honor was turned upon me into destruction, and I retained not strength.
And I shall hear the voice of his words: and in my hearing the voice of his words, and I was lying in a deep sleep upon my face, and my face to the earth.
And behold, a hand touched upon me, and it will move me upon my knees, and the palms of my hands.
And he will say to me, O Daniel, a man of desires, understand thou in the words which I speak to thee, and stand upon thy standing: for now was I sent to thee. And in his speaking with me this word I stood trembling.
And he will say to me, Thou shalt not fear, Daniel: for from the first day that thou gavest thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I came for thy words.
And the chief of the kingdom of Persia stood against me twenty and one days: and behold, Michael, one of the first chiefs, came, to help me; and I was left there near the kings of Persia.
And I came to cause thee to understand what shall happen to thy people in the last of the days: for yet the vision for days.
And in his speaking with me according to these words I gave my face to the earth, and I was dumb.
And behold, as the likeness of the sons of man touched upon my lips: and I shall open my mouth and speak and say to him standing before me, O my lord, by the sight my straights were turned upon me, and I retained not strength.
And how shall this servant of my lord be able to speak with this my lord and I, from this time no strength will stand in me, and breath was not left in me.
And there will add and will touch upon me as the sight of man, and he will strengthen me.
And he will say, Thou shalt not fear, O man of desires: peace to thee; be strong, and be strong. And in his speaking with me I was strengthened, and saying, My lord shall speak; for thou didst strengthen me.
And he will say, Knewest thou wherefore I came to thee? and now I will turn back to war with the chief of Persia: and I shall go forth, and behold, the chief of Grecia coming.
But I will announce to thee that recorded in the writing of truth: and not one strengthening himself with me upon these things but Michael your chief.
And I in the one year to Darius the Mede, standing to make firm and to strengthen for him.
And now I will announce the truth to thee. Behold, yet three kings standing up to Persia; and the fourth shall be rich of great riches above all: and in his becoming strong in his riches he shall rouse up all against the kingdoms of Grecia.
And a strong king stood up, and he ruled from much dominion, and he did according to his will.
And in his standing up his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided to the four winds of the heavens; and not to his latter state, and not according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, and for others from besides these.
And the king of the south shall be strong, and from his chiefs; and he shall be strong above him, and he ruled from much dominion.
And at the end of years they shall join themselves together, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make straightnesses: and she shall not retain the power of the arm, and he shall not stand, and his arm: and she shall be given up, and those bringing her, and he begetting her, and he strengthening her in the times.
And there stood up from the shoot of her roots as he, and he shall come to the strength, and he shall come into the fortress of the king of the north, and he did against them, and was strong:
And also their gods with their molten images, with the vessels of their desire of silver and gold he shall bring in captivity to Egypt; and he shall stand years above the king of the north.
And the king of the south came into his kingdom, and turned back, to his land.
And his sons shall gather themselves together, and they collected a multitude of many forces: and he coming, came and overflowed, and through: and he will turn back, and they shall gather themselves together even to his fortress.
And the king of the south shall be exasperated, and shall come forth and war with him, with the king of the north: and he caused a great multitude to stand, and the multitude was given into his hand.
And taking away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up; and he cast down myriads, and he shall not be strengthened.
And the king of the north turned back and caused a great multitude to stand above the former, and at the end of times, years, coming he shall come with great strength and with much property.
And in these times many shall stand up against the king of the south: and the sons of the violent of thy people shall be lifted up to cause the vision to stand; and they were weak.
And the king of the north shall come and shall pour out a mound, and take the city of fortifications: and the arms of the south shall not stand, and the people of his choices, and no strength to stand.
And he coming against him will do according to his will, and none standing before his face: and he shall stand in the land of glory, and it was finished in his hand.
And he shall set up his face to come with the power of all his kingdom, and the upright with him; and he did: and he will give to him the daughter of women, to corrupt her: and she shall not stand, and shall not be for him.
And he will turn back his face to the isles and take many: and a leader caused his reproach to cease to him; besides his reproach shall turn back to him.
And he shall turn back his face to the fortress of his land: and he was weak and he fell, and he shall not be found.
And there stood up upon his place he causing a task-master to pass through the glory of his kingdom: and in some days he shall be broken, and not in anger and not in war.
And there stood up upon his place he being despised; and they gave not upon him the strength of the kingdom: and he came in tranquillity, and he took the kingdom by flatteries.
And with the arms of an overflowing they shall overflow from his face, and they shall be broken; and also the leader of the covenant.
And from being joined to him he shall do deceit: and he came up and was strong with a small nation.
And in security and in fatnesses of the province shall he come; and he did what his fathers did not, and the fathers of his fathers; the prey and spoil and property shall he scatter to them: and against the fortifications he shall reckon his purposes, and even to a time.
And his strength shall rouse up and his heart against the king of the south with great force; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to war with a great and strong force, even exceedingly; and he shall not stand, for they shall reckon purposes against him.
And they eating his dainties shall break him, and his force shall overflow: and many fell wounded.
And they two kings, their heart for doing evil, and at one table they will speak falsehood; and it shall not prosper: for yet the end at the appointment.
And he shall turn back to his land with great property; and his heart against the holy covenant; and he did, and turned back to his land.
At the appointment he shall turn back, and come into the south; and it shall not be as the first, and as the last.
And the inhabitants of the desert, the Chittims came against him: and he was dejected, and he turned back, and was angry against the holy covenant: and he did, and turned back; and he shall understand for those forsaking the holy covenant.
And seed from him shall stand up, and they profaned the holy place of strength, and they removed the Continuance, and they gave the abomination laying waste.
And those condemning the covenant shall pollute by smooth things: and the people knowing their God shall be strong and do.
And those understanding of the people shall cause to understand to many: and they were weak by the sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by plunder, days.
And in their being weak they shall be helped with a little help: and many were joined to them by flatteries.
And from those understanding shall be weak to try upon them to separate, to become white even to the time of the end: for yet at the appointment.
And the king did according to his will; and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself over every god; and against the God of gods he shall speak wonderful things, and he prospered even till anger was finished: for that being determined was done.
And concerning the God of his fathers he shall not understand, and concerning the desire of women, and concerning every god he shall not understand; for he shall magnify himself over all.
And to the God of fortresses he shall do honor upon his place: and to a god which his fathers knew not he shall do honor with gold and with silver, and with precious stone, and with desires.
And he did to the strong fortifications with a strange god whom he recognized, he shall multiply honor: and he caused them to rule over many, and he will divide the land for a price.
And in the time of the end the king of the south shall wage war with him: and the king of the north shall rush on like a tempest against him, with chariot and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he came into the lands, and overflowed and passed through.
And he came into the land of glory, and many shall be weak: and these shall escape from his hand, Edom and Moab, and the first of the sons of Ammon.
And he shall send forth his hand upon the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not be for escaping.
And he ruled over the hidden things of gold and silver, and over all the desires of Egypt: and the Lybians and Cushites in his steps.
And reports from the sunrising and from the north shall terrify him: and he shall go forth in great wrath to destroy, and to exterminate many.
And he shall plant the tent of his palace between the seas to the mountain of glory of holiness: and he came even to his end, and none helping to him.
And in that time Michael the great chief shall stand up, he standing for the sons of thy people: and it was a time of straits that was not from there being a nation, even to that time: and in that time thy people shall escape, every one being found written in the book.
And many sleeping in the earth of dust shall awake, these to eternal life, and these to reproach and eternal abhorrence.
And those understanding shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and those justifying many, as the stars forever and ever.
And thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run through and knowledge shall be multiplied.
And I Daniel saw, and behold, two others standing, one hence upon the lip of the river, and one thence upon the lip of the river.
And he will say to the man clothed with linen garments which was above to the waters of the river, Till when the end of the wonders?
And I shall hear the man clothed with linen garments, who was above to the waters of the river, and he will lift up his right hand and his left to the heavens, and swear by him living forever, that for an appointment of appointments and a half; in the scattering of the hand of the holy people being finished, all these shall be finished.
And I heard, and I shall not understand: and saying, O my lord, what the last of these things?
And he will say, Go, Daniel: for the words being shut up and sealed even to the time of the end.
And many shall be separated and become white, and be tried; and the unjust did evil: and all the unjust shall not understand; and the intelligent shall understand.
And from the time of removing the continuance, and to give the abomination laying waste, a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
Happy he waiting, and he shall reach to the thousand three hundred and thirty and five days.
And go thou to the end: and thou shalt rest and stand upon thy lot to the end of the days.
The word of Jehovah which was to Hosea son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, son of Joash, king of Israel.
The beginning of the word of Jehovah by Hosea. And Jehovah will say to Hosea, Go, take to thee a wife of fornication and children of fornication; for the land committing fornication, will commit fornication from after Jehovah.
And he will go and take Gomer, daughter of Diblaim; and she will conceive and bring forth to him a son.
And Jehovah will say to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little and I reviewed the bloods of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I caused the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.
And it was in that day and I broke the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
And she will yet conceive and bring forth a daughter. And he will say to him, Call her name, Not being compassionated: for I will no more add to compassionate the house of Israel; for taking away, I will take them away.
And I will compassionate the house of Judah, and I saved them by Jehovah their God, and I will not save them by bow and by sword, and by battle, by horses and by horsemen.
And she will wean the Not being compassionated, and she will conceive and bring forth a son.
And he will say; Call his name, Not my people: for ye are not my people, and I will not be to you.
And the number of the sons of Israel was as the sand of the sea which shall not be measured and shall not be numbered: and it was in the place which it shall be said to them, Ye are not my people, and it shall be said to them, Ye the sons of the living God.
And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel were gathered together, and they appointed to them one head, and they came up out of the land: for great the day of Jezreel.
Say ye to your brethren, My people; and to your sisters, Being compassionated.
Contend with your mother, contend ye, for she is not my wife, and I not her husband: for she shall put away her fornications from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;
Lest I shall strip her naked, and I set her as the day of her birth, and I set her as a desert, and I set her as a land of dryness, and I slew her with thirst.
And her sons I will not compassionate, for they are the sons of fornications.
For their mother committed fornication: she conceiving them acted shamefully: for she said, I will go after those loving me giving me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, mine oil and my drinks.
Therefore, behold me hedging in thy way with thorns, and I walled a wall and she shall not find her beaten paths.
And she pursued those loving her, and she shall not overtake them; and she sought them and she shall not find: and she said, I will go and turn back to my former husband, for it was well to me then more than now.
And she knew not that I gave to her grain, and new wine, and new oil, and I multiplied silver to her, and gold they made for Baal.
For this I will turn back and take away my grain in its time, and my new wine in its appointment, and I took away my wool and my linen to cover her nakedness.
And now will I uncover her wickedness before the eyes of those loving her, and a man shall not deliver her from my hand.
And I caused all her rejoicing to cease, her festival and her new moon, and her Sabbath and all her appointment.
And I destroyed her vine and her fig tree, of which she said, They are wages to me which those loving me gave to me: and I set them for a forest, and the beasts of the field ate them.
And I reviewed upon her the days of the Baals, which she will burn incense to them, and she will be decked with her earring and her necklace, and she will go after those loving her, and she forget me, says Jehovah.
For this, behold, I entice her, and I caused her to go into the desert, and I spake to her heart.
And I gave to her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she was humbled there as the days of her youth and as the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
And it was in that day, says Jehovah, thou shalt call me, My husband; and thou shalt no more call to me, My Lord.
And I put away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
And I cut out for them a covenant in that day with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and I caused them to lie down confidently.
And I betrothed thee to me forever; and I betrothed thee to me in justice and in judgment, and in kindness and in compassions.
And I betrothed thee to me in faithfulness, and thou knewest Jehovah.
And it was in that day, I will answer, says Jehovah, I will answer the heavens and they shall answer the earth;
And the earth shall answer the grain and the new wine and the new oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
And I sowed her to me in the earth; and I compassionated her Not being compassionated; and I said to Not my people, Thou my people; and they will say, My God.
And Jehovah will say to me, Yet go, love a woman loving evil and an adulteress, as Jehovah loves the sons of Israel, and they took to other gods and love raisin-cakes.
And I shall buy her to me for fifteen of silver, and an homer of barley, and a measure of barley:
And saying to her, Many days thou shalt well with me; and thou shalt not commit fornication, and thou shalt not be for a man: and also I am for thee.
For many days shall the sons of Israel dwell, not a king and not a chief and not a sacrifice and not a pillar and it one ephod and teraphim.
Afterward the sons of Israel shall turn back and they sought Jehovah their God, and David their king; and they trembled at Jehovah and at his goodness in the last of the days.
Hear the word of Jehovah, ye sons of Israel: for a contention to Jehovah with the inhabitants of the land, for no truth and no kindness and no knowledge of God in the land.
Swearing and lying, and breaking in pieces, and stealing and committing adultery, they broke forth; and bloods touched upon bloods.
For this the land shall mourn, and every one in it languished with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heavens; and also the fish of the sea shall be taken away.
But a man shall not contend, and he shall not admonish a man: and my people as contending with the priest.
And thou wert weak in the day, and the prophet also was weak with thee by night, and I destroyed thy mother.
My people were cut off from not knowing: because thou didst reject knowledge and I will reject thee from being priest to me: and thou wilt forget the instructions of thy God; I will also forget thy sons, also I.
As they multiplied so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into dishonor.
They will eat up the sin of my people, and they will lift up their soul to their iniquity.
And it was as the people so the priest: and I reviewed upon them their way; and their doings I will turn back to them.
For they ate and they shall not be satisfied, and they committed fornication and they shall not spread abroad: for with Jehovah they left off to watch.
Fornication and wine and new wine will take away the heart.
My people will ask in their counsel, and with their rod they will announce to them: for the spirit of fornications caused to err, and they will commit fornication from under their God.
Upon the heads of the mountains they will sacrifice, and upon the hills they will burn incense, under the oak and the white poplar and the terebinth, because its shadow was good: for this your daughters will commit fornication, and your brides shall commit adultery.
I will not review over your daughters when they shall commit fornication, and over your brides when they shall commit adultery: fur they will separate themselves with harlots, and with prostitutes will they sacrifice: and the people will not understand, they shall be thrown down.
If thou Israel commit fornication Judah shall not transgress; and ye shall not come to Gilgal, and ye shall not go up to the house of vanity, and ye shall not swear, Jehovah lives.
For as a stubborn heifer Israel was stubborn: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide place.
Ephraim is joined to images: leave him.
Their drinking bout departed: committing fornication, they committed fornication: they loved, give ye shame upon her shields.
The wind bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed of their sacrifices.
Hear this ye priests, and attend, ye house of Israel, and give ear, ye house of the king; for the judgment is to you, because ye were a snare to the watch tower and a net stretched out upon Tabor.
And the rowers made deep the slaughter, and I a correction to them all.
I knew Ephraim and Israel were not hid from me: for now thou didst commit fornication, O Ephraim; Israel was deified.
They will not give their doings to turn back to their God, for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they knew not Jehovah.
And the pride of Israel was humbled in his face, and Israel and Ephraim shall be weak in their iniquity; Judah also being weak with them.
With their sheep and with their oxen they will go to seek Jehovah; and they shall not find; he withdrew himself from them.
Against Jehovah they acted faithlessly: for they begat strange sons: now shall the new moon consume them with their portions.
Strike the horn upon the hill, and the trumpet upon the height: make a loud noise at the house of vanity after thee, O Benjamin.
Ephraim shall be for desolation in the day of chastisement: in the tribes of Israel I made known the faithful thing.
The princes of Judah were as they removing the bound: upon them will I pour out my wrath as water.
Ephraim was oppressed, he was broken in judgment because he was willing to go after the command.
And I as a moth to Ephraim, and as rottenness to the house of Judah.
And Ephraim will see his disease and Judah his wound, and Ephraim will go to Assur, and he will send to king Jareb: and he will not be able to heal for you, and he will not remove from you the wound.
For I as the lion to Ephraim, and as the young lion to the house of Judah I, I will rend and go away; I will take away and none delivering.
I will go and turn back to my place, even till when they shall be guilty, and they sought my face: in straitness to them they will turn to me.
Go ye and we will turn back to Jehovah: for he rent and he will heal us; he will strike, and he will bind us up.
He will revive us after two days: in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live before him.
And we shall know, we shall pursue to know Jehovah: as the morning his going forth was prepared; and he shall come as the rain to us, as the latter rain, the early rain of the earth.
What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, O Judah? and your kindness as the cloud of the morning, and as the dew being early went away.
For this I cut off by the prophets; I slew them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments the light going forth.
For I delighted in mercy and not sacrifice; the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.
And they as man passed by the covenant: there they acted faithlessly against me.
Gilead a city working vanity, defrauding from blood.
As troops waiting for a man, the company of priests will break in pieces the way with the shoulder: for they did wickedness.
In the house of Israel I saw something horrible: there the fornications to Ephraim, Israel was defiled.
Also, O Judah, he set a harvest for thee in my turning back the captivity of my people.
As I healed to Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the evils of Shomeron: for they did falsehood, and the thief will come in, and the troop invaded without.
And they will not say to their heart, I remembered all their evil: now their doings surrounded them; they were before my face.

The trumpet to thy mouth: as an eagle upon the house of Jehovah, because they passed by my covenant and they transgressed against my laws.
Israel shall cry to me, My God, we knew thee.
Israel rejected the good: the enemy shall pursue him.

They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; and Ephraim turned back to Egypt, and in Assur they shall eat the unclean thing.
They shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasant to him: their sacrifices as the bread of sorrows to them; all eating it shall be defiled: for their bread for their soul shall not come in to the house of Jehovah.

Prating upon the mouth of the lyre, as David they invented to them instruments of music;

And Amaziah will say to Amos, Thou seer, go flee for thyself to the land of Judah, and eat there bread, and there shalt thou prophesy.

And it will be as the sun rose, and God will appoint a sultry east wind; and the sun struck upon the head of Jonah, and he will faint, and he will ask his soul to die, and say, It is good for me to die rather than live.
And God will say to Jonah, Was it well to kindle to thee for the gourd? And he will say, It was well to kindle to me, even to death.

Make fast the chariot to the steed, thou inhabitress of the smitten: she the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion: for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.

Hating the good and loving the evil; plucking off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones.
And who ate the flesh of my people, and they stripped off their skin from off them; and they brake their bones in pieces, and separated as for the pot, and as flesh in the midst of the kettle.
Then shall they cry to Jehovah and he will not answer them, and he will hide his face from them in that time, as their doings were evil.
Thus said Jehovah for the prophets causing my people to wander, and biting with their teeth, and they called, Peace; and who will not give upon their mouth and they consecrated war against him:

And they seeing were ashamed, and they divining were disgraced, and they covered over their lip, all of them; for no answer of God.

Be in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, as she bringing forth: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and dwell in the field, and going even to Babel; there shalt thou be delivered; there Jehovah will redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
And now many nations were gathered against thee, saying, She shall be defiled, and our eyes shall look upon Zion.
And they knew not the purposes of Jehovah, and they understood not his counsel for he gathered them as sheaves of the threshing-floor.
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will set thy horn iron, and thy hoofs of brass: and thou didst crush many peoples: and I devoted their plunder to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.

And the remnant of Jacob was in the midst of many peoples as the dew from Jehovah, as showers upon the green herb, which will not wait for man and will not delay for the sons of man.
And the remnant of Jacob was among the nations in the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passed through, and he trod down and pulled in pieces, and none delivering.
Thy hand shall be raised up against thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.
And it was in that day, says Jehovah, and I cut off thy horses from the midst of thee, and I destroyed thy chariots.
And I cut off the cities of thy land, and I battled down all thy fortresses:
And I cut off sorceries from thy hand, and they practicing magic shall not be to thee.
And I cut off thy carved images and thy statues from the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands.
And I tore up thine images from the midst of thee, and I destroyed thy cities.
And I did vengeance in anger and in wrath with the nations, which they heard not.
Hear ye now what Jehovah said: Arise, contend thou with the mountains, and the hills shall hear thy voice.

For this the heavens over you were shut up from dew, and the earth withheld her produce.
And I will call the drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine and upon the new oil, and upon what the earth shall bring forth, and upon man and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands.
And Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel will hear, and Joshua son of Josedeck the great priest, and all the remnant of the people, to the voice of Jehovah their God, and to the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God sent him, and the people will fear from the face of Jehovah.

I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood <RF q=*><font color=#808080><i>The hard copy spelling records the following as:</i></font> beween<Rf>between the myrtles which were in shady place; and after him red horses, bay, and white.
And saying, What these, my lord? And the messenger speaking with me, will say to me, I will cause thee to see what these are?
And the man standing between the myrtles will answer and say, These which Jehovah sent to go about in the earth.
And they will answer the messenger of Jehovah standing between the myrtles, and they will say, We walked about in the earth, and behold, all the earth sat and rested.
And the messenger of Jehovah will answer and say, O Jehovah of armies, how long wilt thou not compassionate Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with whom thou wert very angry this seventy years?
And Jehovah will answer the messenger speaking with me good words, consoling words.
And the messenger speaking with me, will say to me, Call thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies; I was jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with great jealousy.
And I am angry with great anger against the nations living in quiet: for I was angry a little and they helped for evil.
For this, thus said Jehovah: I turned back to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of armies, and a cord shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.
Yet call, say, Thus said Jehovah of armies: My cities shall be spread abroad for good; and Jehovah yet comforted Zion and yet chose Jerusalem.
And I shall lift up mine eyes, and see, and behold, four horns.
And saying to the messenger speaking with me, What these? And he will say to me, These the horns which scattered Judah, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
And Jehovah caused me to see four artificers.
And saying, What came these to do? And he will say, saying, These the horns which scattered Judah, so that a man lifted not up his head: and these will come to terrify them, to cast out the horns of the nations lifting up the horn to the land of Judah to scatter it.
I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, a man, and in his hand a cord of measure.
And saying, Whither goest thou? And he will say to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see according to what its breadth, and according to what its length.
And behold, the messenger speaking with me went forth, and another messenger went forth to meet him:
And he will say to him, Run, speak to this youth, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited an open country from the multitude of men and cattle in the midst of her.
And I will be to her, says Jehovah, a wall of fire round about, and I will be for glory in the midst of her.
Alas! alas! and flee ye from the land of the north, says Jehovah: for as the four winds of the heavens I spread you abroad, says Jehovah.
Alas, O Zion, deliver thyself inhabiting the daughter of Babel.
For thus said Jehovah of armies: After glory he sent me to the nations spoiling you: for he touching upon you touched the gate of his eye.
For behold me waving my hand upon them, and they were a spoil to their servants: and ye knew that Jehovah of armies sent me.
Shout for joy and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for behold me coming, and I dwelt in the midst of thee, says Jehovah.
And many nations joined themselves to Jehovah in that day, and they were to me for a people: and I dwelt in the midst of thee, and thou knewest that Jehovah of armies sent me to thee.
And Jehovah inherited Judah his portion upon the holy land, and he yet chose Jerusalem.
Be silent, all flesh, from the face of Jehovah: for he was raised from the habitation of his holiness.
And he will cause me to see Joshua the great priest standing before the messenger of Jehovah, and the adversary standing upon his right hand for his adversary.
And Jehovah will say to the adversary, And Jehovah will rebuke in thee, thou adversary: and Jehovah having chosen in Jerusalem will rebuke in thee: is not this a fire-brand snatched from the fire?
And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments, and he stood before the messenger.
And he will answer and say to them standing before him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from off him, And he will say to him, See, I caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and clothed thee with festive garments.
And saying, They shall set a pure turban upon his head; and they will set the pure turban upon his head, and they will put on the garments. And the messenger of Jehovah stood.
And the messenger of Jehovah will protest to Joshua, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies: If thou wilt go in my way, and if thou shalt watch my watches, and thou also shalt judge my house, and also thou shalt watch my enclosure, and I gave to thee the goings between these standing by.
Hear now, O Joshua the great priest, thou and thy friends sitting before thee, for they are men of wonder: for behold me bringing my servant the Sprout.
For behold the stone which I gave before Joshua; upon one stone seven eyes: behold me engraving its engraving, says Jehovah of armies, and I removed the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says Jehovah of armies, ye shall call each his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.
And the messenger speaking with me will turn back and rouse me up as a man that will be roused from his sleep.
And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I saw, and behold, a candlestick of gold, all of it, and a bowl upon its head, and its seven lights upon it, and seven tubes to the seven lights which were upon its head:
And two olive trees upon it, one from the right of the bowl and one from its left.
And I shall answer and say to the messenger speaking with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
And the messenger speaking with me will answer and say to me, Knewest thou not what these are? And saying, No, my lord.
And he will answer And say to me, saying, This the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by strength, not by power, but by my spirit, said Jehovah of armies.
Who art thou, O great mountain? before the face of Zerubbabel for a level region. And he brought forth the stone of the head, a noise: Grace, grace to it.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel founded this house, and his hands shall complete it; and thou knewest that Jehovah of armies sent me to you.
For who despised the day of small things? and they rejoiced, and they saw the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel, these seven; they the eyes of Jehovah running to and fro in all the earth.
And I shall answer and say to him, What these two olive trees upon the right of the candlestick and upon its left?
And I shall answer the second time, and say to him, What these two twigs of the olive trees which by the hand of the two tubes of gold emptying from them the gold?
And he will say to me, saying, Knewest thou not what these are? And saying, No, my lord.
And he will say, These the two sons of new oil standing by the Lord, of all the earth.
And I shall turn back and lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, a roll flying.
And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I see a roll flying; its length twenty by the cubit, and its breadth, ten by the cubit.
And he will say to me, This the curse going forth upon the face of all the earth: for every one stealing from thence was empty like it; and every one swearing from this was empty like it.
I brought it forth, says Jehovah of armies, and it came into the house of the thief, and into the house of him swearing for falsehood in my name: and it lodged in the midst of his house, and it finished it and its wood and its stones.
And the messenger speaking with me will go forth and say to me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what this going forth.
And saying, What is it? And he will say to me, This the ephah going forth. And he will say, This their eye in all the earth.
And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up: and this one woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
And he will say, This injustice. And he will cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he will cast a stone of lead upon its mouth.
And I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, two women will come forth, and the wind in their wings; and to them wings as the wings of the stork; and they shall lift up the ephah between the earth and between the heavens.
And saying to the messenger speaking with me, Whither do they carry the ephah?
And he will say to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shiner: and it was prepared, and set there upon her base.
And I shall turn back and lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, four chariots going forth from between two mountains; and the mountains, mountains of brass.
In the first chariot, red horses; and in the second chariot, black horses;
And in the third chariot, white horses and in the fourth chariot, horses sprinkled with spots, and fleet.
And I shall answer and say to the messenger speaking with me, What are these, my lord?
And the messenger will answer and say to me, These the four spirits of the heavens going forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
The black horses which are in it, going forth into the land of the north; and the white went forth after them; and the sprinkled with spots went forth to the land of the south.
And the fleet went forth and they will seek to go in order to go to and fro in the earth: and he will say, Go; go to and fro in the earth. And they will go to and fro in the earth.
And he will cry out with me, and speak to me, saying, See them going forth to the land of the north; they caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north.
And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
Take from the captivity, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, which came from Babel, and come thou in that day and go into the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah;
And take silver and gold and make crowns, and set upon the head of Joshua, son of Josedeck the great priest;
And say to him, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies, saying, Behold the man, The Sprout his name; and he shall spring forth from his place and build the temple of Jehovah.
And he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall lift up the majesty, and he sat and ruled upon his throne: and he was priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them two.
And the crown shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, son of Zephaniah, for a remembrance in the temple of Jehovah.
And they being far off shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah; and ye knew that Jehovah of armies sent me to you. And it was if hearing, ye shall hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.
And it will be in the fourth year to Darius the king, the word of Jehovah was to Zechariah in the fourth to the ninth month, in Chisleu;

To speak to the priests which were to the house of Jehovah of armies, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself according as I did, how many the years?
And the word of Jehovah of armies was to me, saying,
Say to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh, and this seventy years, fasting, fasted ye to me, me?
And when ye shall eat, and when ye shall drink, are ye not eating, and are ye not drinking?
Is it not the words which Jehovah called by the hand of the former prophets in Jerusalem being inhabited and in security, and its cities round about her, and inhabiting the south and the low country?
And the word of Jehovah will be to Zechariah, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies, saying. Judge ye the judgment of truth, and do mercy and compassions each to his brother.
And the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor, ye shall not oppress; and ye shall not purpose evil in your heart a man to his brother.
And they will refuse to attend, and they will give a stubborn shoulder, and their ears they made heavy from hearing.
And their heart they set a diamond from hearing the instruction and the words which Jehovah of armies sent by his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: and there will be great wrath from Jehovah of armies.
And it will be as he called and they heard not; so they shall call, and I will not hear, said Jehovah of armies:
And I will toss them about among all the nations which they knew not: and the land was desolate after them from passing through and from turning back: and they shall set the land of desire for a desolation.
And the word of Jehovah of armies will be, saying,
Thus said Jehovah of armies: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy and with great wrath was I jealous for her.
Thus said Jehovah: I turned back to Zion, and I dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem was called, The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of armies, The holy mountain.
Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem, and a man his support in his hand from the multitude of days.
And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in her broad places.

And I brought them, and they dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, in truth and in justice.
Thus said Jehovah of armies: Your hands shall be strong, ye bearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day the house of Jehovah of armies was founded for the temple to be built.
For before these days there was no hire of man, and not any hire of cattle; and to him going out, and to him coming in, no peace from the straits: and I will send all the men each against his neighbor.
And now not as the former days am I to the remnant of this people, says Jehovah of armies.
For the seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit and the earth shall give her produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I caused the remnant of this people to inherit all these.
And it was as ye were a curse in the nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so I will save you, and ye were a praise: ye shall not fear; your hands shall be strengthened.
For thus said Jehovah of armies; As I had in mind to do evil to you in your fathers provoking me to anger, said Jehovah of armies, and, I lamented not.
So I turned back; I had in mind in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: ye shall not fear.
These the words which ye shall do: speak the truth each with his neighbor; truth and the judgment of peace judge ye in your gates.
And ye shall not purpose evil, a man to his neighbor, in your heart; and ye shall not love the oath of falsehood: for all these which I hated, says Jehovah.
And the word of Jehovah of armies will be to me, saying,

The lifting up of the word of Jehovah in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus its gift: when to Jehovah the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel.
And also Hamath shall be the bound in it; Tyre and Zidon, for it was wise exceedingly.

Behold, Jehovah will dispossess her, and he struck her strength in the sea; and she shall be devoured by fire.
Ashkelon shall see and shall fear; and Gaza, and she shall be greatly pained, and Ekron; for her confidence was ashamed; and the king perished from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
And a foreigner dwelt in Ashdod, and I cut off the pride of the rovers.
And I took away his bloods from his mouth, and his abominable things from between his teeth: and being left he also to our God, and he was a thousand in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
And I encamped at my house a garrison from him passing by, and from him turning back: and he driving shall no more pass through against them: for now I saw with mine eyes.

Also thou by the blood of thy covenant I sent forth thy bound ones from the pit no water in it.
Turn back to the fortress, ye captives of hope: also announcing this day I will turn back double to thee;
For I tread out Judah to me, I filled the bow with Ephraim, and I raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and I set thee as the sword of the strong one.
And Jehovah will be seen upon them, and his arrow shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord Jehovah will strike upon the trumpet, and he went with tempests of the south.
Jehovah of armies shall protect over them; and they devoured and subdued with the stones of the sling; and they drank, they made a noise as from wine; and they filled as the vase, as the corners of the altar.
And Jehovah their God saved them in that day as the sheep of his people: for the stones of consecration, lifting themselves up in his land.
For what his good, and what his beauty! Grain shall cause the young men to increase, and new wine the virgins.
Ask ye from Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah made lightnings, and he will give rain of heavy showers to them, to each the green herb in the field.
For the family gods spake vanity, and the diviners saw falsehood, and they will speak dreams of falsehood they will comfort in vain: for this, they removed as a flock, they were afflicted for there was no shepherd.
Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will review upon the he goats: for Jehovah of armies reviewed upon his flock the house of Judah, as the house of his strength in the war.
From him the chief, from him the nail, from him the bow of war, from him came forth every tyrant together.
And they were as the strong treading down in the mud of the streets in the battle: and they waged war, for Jehovah was with them, and they riding horses were ashamed.
And I strengthened the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I turned them back for I compassionated them, and they were as if I cast them not off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
And they were as the strong one of Ephraim, and their heart rejoiced as from wine: and their sons shall see, and rejoice; their heart shall exult in Jehovah.

And I strengthened them in Jehovah; and in his name shall they go about, says Jehovah.
Open the doors, O Lebanon, and fire shall devour among thy cedars.
Wail, O cypress, for the cedar fell; for the powerful ones were destroyed: wail, ye oaks of Bashan, for the forest of the vintage went down.
A voice of wailing of the shepherds, for their greatness was destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of Jordan was destroyed.
Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;
Which they possessing them will slaughter them, and they will not be punished: and they selling them will say, Blessed be Jehovah; and I shall be rich: and their shepherds had not pity upon them.
For I will no more have pity upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah: and behold, the men to be found each in the hand of his neighbor, and in the hand of his king: and they beat the land, and I will not deliver from their hand.
And I will feed the flock of slaughter for you, and the poor of the sheep: And I will take to me two rods; to the one I called Beauty, and to the one, I called Cords; and I will feed the sheep.
And I will conceal three shepherds in one month; and my soul will be shortened for them, and also their soul loathed for me.
And saying, I will not feed you: the dying shall die, and the concealed shall be concealed; and they being left shall eat each the flesh of her neighbor.
And I will take my rod Beauty, and I will cut it off, to break my covenant which I cut out with all the peoples.
And it shall be broken in that day: and the poor of the flock watching me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.
And saying to them, If good in your eyes, give ye my hire; and if not, desist. And they will weigh my hire, thirty of silver.
And Jehovah will say to me, Cast it to the potter: a splendor of price which I was prized of them. And I shall take the thirty of silver and cast it in the house of Jehovah, to the potter.
And I shall cut off my second rod, Cords, to break the brotherhood between Judah and between Israel.
And Jehovah will say to me, Yet take to thee the vessels of a foolish shepherd.
For behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, he shall not review those being concealed; the youth he shall not seek, and he shall not heal the broken, and he shall not nourish the standing firmly: and he shall eat the flesh of the fading, and he shall break their hoofs.
Wo! to the empty shepherd forsaking the sheep; the sword upon his arm, and upon his right eye: and his arm being dried up, shall be dried up, and his right eye being dim, shall be dim.
The Lifting up of the word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, stretching forth the heavens and founding the earth, and forming the spirit of man in the midst of him.
Behold, I set Jerusalem a dish of reeling to all peoples round about, and against Judah shall he be in the straitness against Jerusalem.
And it was in that day I will set Jerusalem a stone of burden to all peoples: all loading her, being out; shall be cut; and all the nations of the earth were gathered together against her.
In that day, says Jehovah, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and upon the house of Judah I will open mine eyes, and every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness.
And the thousands of Judah said in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem strength to me in Jehovah of armies their God.
In that day I will set the thousands of Judah as a fire-pan of fire among the woods, and as a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they devoured upon the right and upon the left all the peoples round about: and Jerusalem shall yet dwell in her place in Jerusalem.
And Jehovah saved the tents of Judah first, so that the glorying of the house of David shall not be magnified, and the glorying of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, against Judah.
In that day Jehovah shall protect about the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he being weak among them in that day was as David; and the house of David as God, as the messenger of Jehovah before them.
And it was in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.
And I poured out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplications: and they looked to me whom they pierced, and they mourned for him as mourning for the only begotten, and being embittered for him as being embittered for the first-born.
In that day the mourning shall be magnified as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
And the land mourned, families, families by themselves; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of giving by itself, and their wives by themselves.
The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of hearing by itself, and their wives by themselves.
All the families being left, families, families, by themselves, and their wives by themselves.
In that day shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for putting away.
And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will cut off the names of the images from the land, and they shall be remembered no more: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
And it was if a man shall yet prophesy, and his father and his mother who begat him, said to him, Thou shalt not live, for thou spakest falsehood in the name of Jehovah: and his father and his mother begetting him thrust him through in his prophesying.
And it was in that day the prophets shall be ashamed, each of his vision, in his prophesying; and they shall not put on a mantle of hair to speak lies:
And saying, I am not a prophet; I a man working the land; for man sold me from my youth.
And saying to him, What these wounds between thy hands? And he said, Which I was struck in the house of those loving me.
O sword, be raised up against my shepherd, and against the man of my fellowship, says Jehovah of armies: strike the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered; and I turned back my hand upon the little ones.

And I brought the third through fire, and I purified them as purifying silver, and I tried them as trying gold: he shall call on my name and I will answer him: I said, He is my people; and he shall say, Jehovah my God.
Behold, the day to Jehovah coming, and thy spoil was divided in the midst of thee.
And I gathered all the nations against Jerusalem for war; and the city was taken, and the houses were plundered, and the women shall be ravished; and half the city shall go forth into captivity, and the people being left shall not be cut off from the city.
And Jehovah went forth and waged war with these nations as the day of his warring in the day of encounter.
And his feet stood in that day upon the mount of Olives which is upon the face of Jerusalem from the east; and the mount of Olives was cleft asunder from its half from the sunrising and the sea, and a very great valley; and half of the mountain removed to the north, and its half to the south.
And ye fled to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to the side, and ye fled as ye fled from the face of the shaking in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah: and Jehovah my God came, all the holy ones with thee.

And it was one day it shall be known to Jehovah, not day, and not night: and it was at the time of evening it shall be light.
And it was in that day living waters went forth from Jerusalem: half of them to the former sea, and half of them to the last sea: in summer and in autumn shall it be.
And Jehovah was for king over all the earth: in that day Jehovah shall be one, and his name one.
He shall surround all the land as the desert from the hill to the pomegranate south of Jerusalem: and it was high, and she dwelt in her place from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the first gate, even to the gate of the corner, and the tower of Hananeel even to the wine-presses of the king.
And they shall dwell in her and destruction shall be no more: and Jerusalem shall be confidently dwelt in.
And this shall be the smiting which Jehovah will smite all the peoples who made war upon Jerusalem; and he caused his flesh to pine away, and he stood upon his feet, and his eyes shall pine away in their holes, and his tongue shall pine away in their mouth.
And it was in that day there shall be great consternation of Jehovah among them; and they laid hold each upon the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall come up upon the hand of his neighbor.
And also Judah shall wage war in Jerusalem; and he gathered the strength of all the nations round about, gold and silver and garments to an exceeding multitude.
And thus shall be the smiting of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the cattle which shall be in those camps, as this smiting.
And every one being left of all the nations coming against Jerusalem, and they went up from year to year to worship to the king, Jehovah of armies, to keep a festival, the festival of booths.
And it was who will not come up of the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship to the king, Jehovah of armies, and upon them shall not be rain.
And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, and it not coming, and not upon them there shall be the smiting which Jehovah shall smite the nations which will not come up to keep the festival, the festival of booths.
This shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the nations which will not come up to keep the festival, the festival of booths.
In that day shall be upon the bells of the horse, Holiness to Jehovah; and it was the pots in the house of Jehovah as vases before the face of the altar.
And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah was holiness to Jehovah of armies: and all sacrificing came and took of them, and boiled in them: and the Canaanite shall be no more in the house of Jehovah in that day.
The lifting up the word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of Malachi.
I loved you, said Jehovah. And ye said, In what didst thou love us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob? says Jehovah: and loving Jacob.
And I hated Esau, and I will set his mountains a desolation, and his inheritance for the jackals of the desert.
For Edom will say, We were broken down, and we will turn back and build the wastes; thus said Jehovah of armies: They shall build and I will pull down; and calling to them, The bound of injustice, and, The people with whom Jehovah was very angry, even to forever.
And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah will be magnified from above to the bound of Israel.
A son will honor the father, and the servant his lord; and if I a father, where mine honor? and if I their lord, where my fear? said Jehovah of armies to you, O priests despising my name. And ye said, In what did we despise thy name?
Bringing polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye said, In what did we pollute thee? In your saying, The table of Jehovah it was despised.
And if ye shall bring near the blind for a sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye shall bring near the lame and the sick, is it not evil? bring A near now to thy governor; will he delight in thee, or lift up thy face? said Jehovah of armies.
And now, beseech now, the face of God, and he will be gracious to us: this was from your hand: will he lift up from you the faces? says Jehovah of armies.
Who also among you and he will shut the doors? and ye shall not make light mine altar gratuitously. Not to me delight in you, said Jehovah of armies, and I will not delight in the gift of your hand.
For from the rising of the sun and even to its going down, great my name among the nations; and in every place incense being brought to my name, and a clean gift: for great my name among the nations, said Jehovah of armies.
And ye profaning it in your saying, The table of Jehovah it being polluted; and its fruit, its food was despised.
And ye said, Behold, what a weariness! and ye puffed at it, said Jehovah of armies; and ye brought the spoiled and the lame, and the sick; and ye brought the gift: shall I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.
And cursed he deceiving, and there is in his flock a male, and he vowed and sacrificed a corrupt thing to Jehovah: for I am a great king, said Jehovah of armies, and my name terrible among the nations.
And now to you this command, O ye priests.
If ye will not hear and if ye will not set upon your heart to give honor to my name, said Jehovah of armies, and I sent a curse upon you, and I cursed your blessings, and also I cursed it for your not setting upon the heart.
Behold me rebuking the seed to you, and I scattered dung upon your faces, the dung of your festivals; and it lifted you up to it.
And ye knew that I sent this command to you, for my covenant to be with Levi, said Jehovah of armies.
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I will give them to him fearing, and he shall fear me, and from the face of my name he was terrified.
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: in truth and in uprightness he went with me, and he turned back many from iniquity.
For the lips of the priest shall watch knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth: for he is the messenger of Jehovah of armies.
And ye departed out of the way; ye made many weak by the law; ye corrupted the covenant of Levi, said Jehovah of armies.
And also I set you despised and low to all the people, according as ye watch not my way, and lift up the face against the law.
Is there not one father to us all? is there not one God creating us? wherefore shall we deal faithlessly each against his brother, to profane the covenant of our fathers?
Judah dealt faithlessly, and an abomination was done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah profaned the holy place of Jehovah which he loved, and married the daughter of a strange god.
Jehovah will cut off to the man which shall do it, him waking, and him answering from the tents of Jacob, and him bringing near a gift to Jehovah of armies.
And this ye will do the second time, covering with tears the altar of Jehovah, with weepings and shrieks, from not any more looking to the gift, and to take delight from your hand.
And ye said, For what? For that Jehovah testified between thee and between the wife of thy youth, which thou didst deal faithlessly against her, and she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant.
And did he not make one? And the remainder of the spirit to him. And why one? Seeking a seed of God. And ye matched in your spirit, and he shall not deal faithlessly against the wife of thy youth.
For he hated sending away, says Jehovah God of Israel: and he covered violence with his clothing, said Jehovah of armies: and ye watched in your spirit, and ye shall not deal faithlessly.
Ye wearied Jehovah with your words: and ye said, In what did we weary? In your saying, Every one doing evil is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and he delighted in them; or, Where the God of judgment?
Behold me sending my messenger, and he looked upon the way before my face: and suddenly Jehovah whom ye seek shall come to his temple, and the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in: behold him coming, said Jehovah of armies.
And who enduring the day of his coming? and who standing in his being seen? for he is as the fire of the crucible, as the alkali of the fuller.
And he sat melting and cleansing silver: and he cleansed the sons of Levi, and he purified them as gold and as silver, and they were to Jehovah bringing near the sacrifice in justice.
And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem was pleasant to Jehovah, as the days of old and as the former years.
And I came near to you for judgment: and I was a swift witness against those practicing magic, and against those committing adultery, and against those swearing to falsehood, and against those oppressing the hire of the hireling, the widow and the orphan, and those turning aside the stranger, and they feared not me, said Jehovah of armies.
For I am Jehovah, I changed not; and ye the sons of Jacob were not finished.
For from the days of your fathers ye departed from my laws, and ye watched not. Turn back to me and I will turn back to you, said Jehovah of armies. And ye said, In what shall we turn back?
Will man defraud God? For ye defraud me. And ye said, In what did we defraud thee? The tenths and the offerings.
Ye are cursed with a curse: and ye defrauded me, the nation all of it.
Bring ye all the tenths to the house of treasure, and food shall be in my house, and try me now in this, said Jehovah of armies, if I will not open to you the lattices of the heavens, and empty out to you a blessing, even is it not a sufficiency.
And I rebuked upon the eater for you, and he shall not corrupt for you the fruit of the earth; and the vine in the field shall not be barren to you, says Jehovah of armies.
And all nations pronounced you happy, for ye shall be a land of delight, said Jehovah of armies.
Your words were strong against me, said Jehovah. And ye said, What did we speak against thee?
Ye said, Vanity to serve God: and what profit that we watched his watches, and that we went mourning from the face of Jehovah of armies?
And now we pronounce the proud happy; also they working injustice were built up; also they tried Jehovah and they will be delivered.
Then they fearing Jehovah spake each to his neighbor, and Jehovah will attend and will hear, and write a book of remembrance before him for those fearing Jehovah, and for thinking upon his name.
And they were to me, said Jehovah of armies, for the day which I make wealth; and I spared for them as a man will spare for the son serving him.
And ye turned back and saw between the just to the unjust, and between him serving God and to him serving him not.
For behold, the day coming, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all doing injustice were straw: and the day coming burnt them, said Jehovah of armies, that it shall not leave to them root and branch.
And to you fearing my name the sun of justice arose, and healing in his wings; and ye went forth and spread as calves of the stall.
And ye tread down the unjust; for they were ashes under the soles of your feet in the day which I doing, said Jehovah of armies.
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the laws and the judgments.
Behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the day of Jehovah, great and terrible:
And he turned back the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to the fathers, lest I shall come and strike the earth with utter destruction.
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob: and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Rath; and Obed begat Jesse;
And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her of Urias.
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz; begat Ezekias;
And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren upon the transferring of Babylon.
And after the transferring of Babylon Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim beget Elind;
And Elind begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, being called Christ, the anointed.
Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations; and from David to the transferring of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the transferring of Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.
And the generation of Jesus Christ was thus: for Mary his mother having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child by the Holy Ghost.
And Joseph her husband being just, and not willing to expose her to disgrace, wished to let her go in secret.
And reflecting upon these things, behold a messenger of the Lord appeared to him saying, Joseph, thou son of David, thou shouldest not fear to take to thyself Mary thy wife: for that begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins,
And the whole of this has been that it might be completed having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.
And Joseph having awaked from sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord commanded him:
And he took to himself his wife, and knew her not till she brought forth her first born son: and be called his name Jesus.
And Jesus born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold the magi from the sunrisings arrived in Jerusalem, saying:
Where is he born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the sunrising, and have come to worship him.
And Herod the king having heard, was stirred up, and all Jerusalem with him.
And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus has it been written by the prophet:
And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means art thou least among the leaders of Judah for out of thee shall come forth the leader, who shall feed my people.
Then Herod having secretly called for the magi, searched thoroughly from them the time of the star appearing.
And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, Having gone, examine thoroughly concerning the child; and when ye should find, announce ye to me, so that I also, having gone, will worship him.
And they having heard the king went forth; and, behold the star they saw in the sunrising, it led before them, till having come, it stood above where the young child was.
And seeing the star, they rejoiced with great joy exceedingly.
And having come into the house, they found the young child with Mary his mother, and having fallen, they worshipped him; and having opened their treasures they brought forward to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
And having received intimation of the divine will in a dream not to turn back to Herod, by another way they went back to their own country.
And they, having gone back, lo, the messenger of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Having risen, take to thyself the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and be there till I speak to thee; for Herod is about to seek the young child to destroy him.
And having risen, he took to himself the young child and his mother by night, and turned back in Egypt:
And was there till the death of Herod: that it might be completed having been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
Then Herod, seeing he was deluded by the magi, was very angry, and having sent, destroyed all the children which in Bethlehem, and in all its bounds, from two years and under, according to the time he examined thoroughly of the magi.
Then was completed that spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
A voice was heard in Rama, wailing, and weeping, and much lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, for they are not.
And Herod having died, behold a messenger of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
Having risen, take to thyself the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they seeking the soul of the young child have died.
And having risen, he took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
And having heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea, instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there; and having received intimation of the divine will in a dream, he turned back into the parts of Galilee.
And having come, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be completed spoken by the prophets, That he shall be called a Nazarite.
In these days John the Baptist is present, proclaiming in the desert of Judea;
And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
For this is he spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
And this John had his garment from camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all round about Jordan;
And they were immersed in Jordan by him, acknowledging their sins.
And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has indicated to you to flee from the wrath about to come?
Do ye therefore fruit worthy of repentance.
And think not to say in yourselves we have Abraham a father; for I say to you, that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.
And now also the axe lies at the root of the trees; therefore every one not making good fruit is cut off and cast into fire.
I truly immerse you in water to repentance; but he coming after me is stronger than I, whose shoes I am not fit to lift up; he shall immerse in the Holy Spirit, and fire.
Whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the store; but he will burn down the chaff in inextinguishable fire.
Then Jesus approaches from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be immersed by him.
And John hindered him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and dost thou come to me?
And Jesus having answered said to him, Permit now; for so it is suitable for us to complete all justice: then he permitted him.
And Jesus, having been immersed, went up straight from the water, and, behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.
And behold a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the desert to be tried by the devil.
And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.
And the tempter having come to him, said, If thou art the Son of God, say that these stones should become bread.
And he having answered, said, It has been written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word going forth through the mouth of God.
Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and sets him upon the small wing of the temple;
And says to him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down; for it has been written, That to his messengers he will command concerning thee; and in the hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou strike thy foot against a stone.
Jesus said to him, Again has it been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
Again, the devil takes him into a very high mount, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;
And he says to him, All these will I give to thee, if, falling down, thou wouldst worship me.
Then says Jesus to him, Retire, Satan; for it has been written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and him alone shalt thou serve.
Then the devil lets him go, and behold, the messengers came up, and they served him.
And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, went back into Galilee.
And having left Nazareth behind, having come, he dwelt in Capernaum, near the sea, in the boundaries of Zabulon and Nephthalim:
That it might be completed having been spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,
The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations:
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to them sitting in the room and shadow of death, light has sprung up to them.
From then Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
And Jesus, walking about by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon being called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a sweep-net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you the fishermen of men.
And they instantly having let go their nets, followed him.
And having proceeded thence, he saw other two brethren, James him of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, adjusting their nets; and he called them.
And they having instantly let go the ship and their father, followed him.
And Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing disease, and every weakness in the people.
And a report went forth of him into the whole of Syria: and they brought to him all those having injuries, being oppressed by various diseases, and trials, and being under the influence of a demon, and being lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them.
And many crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond Jordan.
And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain; and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.
And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,
Happy the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of the heavens.
Happy they suffering: for they shall be comforted.
Happy the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
Happy they hungering and thirsting for Justice: for they shall be filled.
Happy the compassionate: for they shall be commiserated.
Happy the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Happy they making peace: for they shall be called sons of God.
Happy they driven out for justice: for their's is the kingdom of the heavens.
Happy are ye, when they shall upbraid you, and drive you out, and say every evil word against you, lying, for my sake.
Rejoice and be transported with joy; for much your reward in the heavens for so they drove out the prophets which before you.
Ye are the salt of the earth: and if the salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be salted? it is yet strong for nothing, except to be cast without, and to be trodden under foot of men.
Ye are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid, set on a mountain.
Neither do they burn a light, and set it under a basket, but upon a chandelier: and it shines to all in the house.
So let your light shine before men, that they see your good works, and praise your Father, him in the heavens.
Think not that I have come to abolish the law, or the prophets: for I have come not abolish, but to complete.
For verily I say to you, Till heaven pass away, and earth, one iota, or one mark, should not pass away from the law, till all should be.
Whoever therefore, should loose one of the least of these commands, and so teach men, he shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens: but whoever should do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
For I say to you, That except your justice abound more than the scribes and Pharisees, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.
Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill: and whoever should kill shall be subject to judgment:
But I say to you, That every one becoming angry with his brother, shall be subject to judgment: and whoever should say to his brother, Raca, should be, subject to the council: and whoever should say, O foolish, shall be subject to a hell of fire.
If therefore, thou bring thy gift upon the altar, and there thou remember that thy brother has anything against thee,
Let go there thy gift, before the altar, and retire; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then, having come, bring thy gift.
Be kindly disposed to thy opponent quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest thy opponent should deliver thee to the judge, and the judge should deliver thee to the assistant, and thou be cast into prison.
Verily I say to thee, Thou shouldst not come out thence, even till, thou shouldst give back the last fourth.
Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
But I say to you, That every one seeing a woman, to eagerly desire her, has already committed adultery with her, in his heart.
And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members be destroyed, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.
And if thy right hand give thee cause of offence, cut it off, and cast from thee; for it is profitable to thee, that one of thy members should be destroyed; and not thy whole body should be cast into hell.
And it was said, That whosoever should loose his wife, let him give her a repudiation.
But I say to you, That whosoever shall let go his wife except for the reason of adultery, makes her to commit adultery; and whosoever should marry her having been loosed, commits adultery.
Again, ye have heard, that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not swear a false oath, and thou shalt return to the Lord thine oaths.
But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven, it is the throne of God:
Neither by the earth; for it is the footstool of his feet: neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great kings.
Neither shouldst thou swear by thy head, for thou cant not make one hair white or black.
But let your word be Yea, yea, and No, no: but that above this is of evil.
Ye have heard, that it has been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
But I say to you, not to resist evil: but whosoever shall smite thee with a rod upon thy right cheek, turn to him also the other.
And to him wishing to be judged with thee, and to take thy coat, let go to him also thy garment.
And whoever shall compel thee to carry dispatches one mile, go forward with him two.
To him asking thee, give thou, and him wishing to borrow from thee, thou shouldst not turn away.
Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy.
But I say to you, Love your enemies, praise them cursing you, do well to them hating you, and pray for them threatening you, and driving you out.
So that ye might be sons of your Father, which in the heavens: for he makes his sun rise upon evil and good, and rains on the just and unjust.
For if ye love them loving you, what reward have you? do not also the tax collectors the same?
And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye above ordinary? and do not the tax collectors the same?
Therefore, be ye perfected, as your Father which is in the heavens is perfected.
Attend ye not to do your justice before men, to be seen to them; and if otherwise ye have no reward from your Father which in the heavens.
When therefore thou doest alms, thou shouldst not sound the trumpet before thee, as hypocrites do in the assemblies, and in the streets, that they might be praised by men. Verily I say to you, They have their reward.
But thou doing alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right does:
That thine alms might be in secret; and thy Father, who seeing in secret, shall give back to thee openly.
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love in the assemblies, and in the corners of the broad ways to stand praying, so that they might appear to men. Verily I say to you, that they have their reward.
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy store-house, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father who seeing in secret shall give back to thee openly.
And praying, talk ye not vainly as the nations; for they think that by their profaneness of speech they shall be listened to.
Therefore make not yourselves like them: for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye ask him.
Therefore so do ye pray: Our Father which in the heavens, Let thy name be declared holy.
Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be as in heaven also upon the earth.
Give us this day our bread sufficient for sustenance.
And let go to us our debts, as we let go to our debtors.
And thou shouldst not lead us into temptation, but deliver thou us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if ye let go to men their faults, your Father which in the heavens will also let go to you.
But if ye should not let go to men their faults, neither will your Father let go your faults.
And when ye fast, be not, as hypocrites, of gloomy aspect: for they conceal their faces that they might appear to men fasting. Verily I say to you, That they have their reward.
And thou fasting, anoint thy head, and wash thy face;
That thou mightest not appear to men fasting, but to thy Father which in secret; and thy Father which in secret, will give back to thee openly.
Treasure not up to you treasures upon earth, where moth and gnawing destroy, and thieves dig through and steal:
But treasure to you treasures in heaven, where neither moth, nor gnawing destroy; and where thieves dig not through, nor steal.
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be light.
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be dark. If therefore the light which in thee is darkness, how much the darkness.
None can serve two lords: for either he will hate one and love the other; or hold firmly to one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
For this I say to you, Be not anxious about your soul, what ye eat, and what ye drink; nor about your body, what ye put on. Is not the soul more than food, and the body than dress?
Look ye upon the fowls of heaven; for they neither sow, nor reap, nor collect into stores; and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Do ye not rather differ from them.
Which of you, being anxious, can add one cubit to his size?
And about dress, why are ye anxious? Consider the white lilies of the field, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin:
And I say to you, that neither Solomon in all his glory was surrounded as one of these.
And if the grass of the field, being this day, and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes much rather you, ye of little faith!
Therefore be ye not anxious, saying: What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, What shall we put round us?
For all these the nations seek for; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these shall be added to you.
Therefore should ye not be anxious about the morrow: for the morrow shall be anxious about the things of itself. Sufficient for the day its evil.
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye measure, it shall be repaid to you.
And why seest thou the mote which is in thy brother's eye, and the beam in thine eye thou observest not?
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let go I will cast out the mote from thine eye: and behold a beam in thine eye.
Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine eye, and thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote from thy brother's eye.
Ye should not give the holy thing to dogs neither should ye cast your pearls before swine, lest they tread them down with their feet, and having turned, should rend you.
Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.
For everyone asking, receives and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking shall be opened.
Or what man is of you, which, if his son ask bread, he will not give him a stone?
And if he ask a fish, he will not give him a serpent?
If ye, therefore, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children how much more will your Father which is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?
Therefore all whatever ye would that men should do to you, so also do ye to them; for this is the law and the prophets.
Enter ye in through the strait gate, for broad the gate and spacious the way leading to destruction, and many are they coming in through it.
For strait the gate and afflicted the way leading into life, and few are they finding it.
And hold from false prophets which come in to you in sheep's dresses, but within they are rapacious wolves.
By their fruits shall ye know them. Far from it, do they gather grapes from thorns, or figs from caltrops.
So every good tree makes good fruits; but the rotten tree makes evil fruits.
A good tree cannot make evil fruits, nor a rotten tree make good fruits.
Every tree not making good fruit is cut off, and cast into fire.
Wherefore from their fruits shall ye know them.
Not every one saying to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens; but he doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have we cast out evil spirits, and in thy name done many powers?
And then shall I confess to them that I never knew you. Go away from me, ye working iniquity.
Therefore, every one which hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a discerning man which built his house upon the rock.
And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew, and fell upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock.
And every one hearing these my words and doing them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house upon sand.
And the rain descended, and rivers came, and winds blew and struck upon that house, and it fell, and great was its fall.
And it was when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were struck with amazement at his teaching:
For he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes.
And having come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And, behold, a leper, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.
And having stretched forth the hand, Jesus touched him, saying, I will; be thou cleansed and instantly his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus says to him, See thou tell no one; but retire, show thyself to the priest, and bring near the gift which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
And Jesus having entered into Capernaum, a captain of a hundred came to him, and beseeching him,
And saying, Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being grievously tormented.
And Jesus says to him, I, having come, will cure him.
And the captain of a hundred having answered said, Lord, I am not fit that thou shouldest enter in under my roof: but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
For I also am a man under power, having soldiers under me: and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does.
And Jesus having heard, admired, and said to those following; Verily I say to you, not in Israel have I found such faith.
And I say to you, That many shall come from the sunrising and the descents, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens.
But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said to the captain of a hundred, Retire; as thou hast believed, let it be to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour.
And Jesus, having come into Peter's house, saw his mother-in-law having been laid up, and affected with fever.
And he touched her hand, and the fever let her go: and she arose, and served them.
And evening being come, they brought him many possessed with evil spirits: and he east out the spirits by the word, and cured all having evils:
So that that spoken by Esaias the prophet was completed, saying. He took our weakness, and lifted up diseases.
And Jesus seeing many crowds about him, encouraged to go away beyond.
And one scribe, coming near, said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
And Jesus says to him, The foxes have dens, and the fowls of heaven occupy nests; but the Son of man has not where he might recline the head.
And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, permit me first to go and inter my father.
But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead inter the dead.
And he having gone into a ship, his disciples followed him.
And, behold, a great shaking was in the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves: and be slept.
And his disciples, having come near, awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we are lost.
And he says to them, Why are ye timorous, ye of little faith? Then having risen, he censured the winds and sea; and there was a great calm.
And the men admired, saying, of what race is this for the winds and the sea listen to him.
And he having come beyond the country of the Gergesenes, two possessed with evil spirits, coming out of the tombs, met him, very rough, so that not any could pass by that way.
And, behold, they cried out, saying, What to us and thee, Jesus, Son of God? hast thou come here to torture us before the time.
And far off from them was a herd of many swine grazing.
And the evil spirits besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.
And he said to them, Retire. And having gone, they went away into the herd of swine: and, behold, all the herd of swine rushed down the precipice into the sea, and died in the water.
And they feeding fled; and having come into the city, they announced all things, and those of the possessed with evil spirits.
And, behold, all the city came forth to the meeting to Jesus: and seeing him, they besought that he would go away from their boundaries.
And having entered into a ship, he passed over and came into his own city.
And, behold, they brought him a paralytic, laid upon a bed; and Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Take courage, child thy sins are let go to thee.
And behold, certain of the scribes said in themselves, This defames.
And Jesus seeing their reflections, said, Why reflect ye within your hearts?
For why is it easier to say, Sins are let go to thee; or say, Arise and walk?
But that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to let go sins, (then he says to the paralytic), Having risen, take up thy bed and retire to thy house.
And having risen, he went away into his house.
And the crowds, seeing, admired, and praised God, giving such power to men.
And Jesus, passing away from thence, saw a man sitting by the custom-house, being called Matthew, and he says to him, Follow me; and having risen he followed him.
And it was he sitting at table in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinful, having come, sat at table with Jesus and his disciples.
And the Pharisees, seeing, said to his disciples, Wherefore does your teacher eat with tax collectors and the sinful?
And Jesus having heard, said to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but they having evils.
And having gone, learn what is this, I wish mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
Then came to him the disciples of John; saying, Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?
And Jesus said to them, The sons of the nuptial chamber cannot mourn inasmuch as the bridegroom is with them; but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast.
And no one puts on a cover of uncombed fragment upon an old garment, for its filling takes away from the garment, and the division is Worse.
Neither do they cast new wine into old wine-skins: but if otherwise, the wine-skins burst, and the wine is poured out, and the wine-skins are destroyed; but they cast new wine into new wine-skins, and they are both preserved.
He speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler, having come, worshipped him, saying; That my daughter has just now died: but having come, put thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
And Jesus having risen, followed him: also his disciples.
And behold, a woman discharging blood twelve years, having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment:
For she said in herself, If I should only touch the hem of his garment, I shall be saved.
And Jesus having turned round, and seeing her, said, Take courage, daughter; thy faith has saved thee. And the woman was saved from that hour.
And Jesus having come into the ruler's house, and seeing the flute players and the crowd making an uproar,
He says to them, Give way; for the girl is not dead but sleeps; and they mocked him.
But when the crowd was driven forth, having entered, he seized her hand, and the little girl was awakened.
And this report went forth into that whole land.
And Jesus passing from thence, two blind ones followed him, crying out and saying, Commiserate us, O son of David.
And having come into the house, the blind came to him: and Jesus says to them, Believe ye that I can do this? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus threatened them, saying, See, let none know.
But they, having gone out, divulged it in that, whole land.
And they having gone, behold they brought to him a man dumb, possessed with an evil spirit.
And the demon being cast out, the dumb, spake, and the crowd admired, saying, It was never so brought to light in Israel.
But the Pharisees said, By the chief of demons he casts out demons.
And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every weakness in the people.
And having seen the crowds, he felt compassion for them, for they were relaxed and dispersed, as sheep not having a shepherd.
Then he says to his disciples, Truly the harvest much, but the laborers few.
Implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, so that he might draw forth laborers into his harvest.
And having called his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every weakness.
And the names of the twelve sent are these: first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, he of Zebedee and John his brother;
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James, he of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, he surnamed Thaddeus;
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, he also having delivered him up.
These twelve Jesus sent, having announced to them, saying, Go not in the way of the nations, and into the city of the Samaritans enter ye not.
But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And going, proclaim, saying, That the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.
Cure the sick, cleanse the leprous, rouse the dead, cast out demons; as a gift ye have received, as a gift give.
Provide not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
Nor wallet for the way, nor two coats, nor shoes, nor rod: for the laborer is worthy of his food.
And to whatever city or town ye should come in, examine who in it is worthy; and there remain till ye go forth.
And entering into a house, do ye greet it.
And if the house should be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you.
And whoever should not receive you, nor hear your words, coming out of that house or that city, shake off the cloud of the dust of your feet.
Verily I say to you, it shall be more supportable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore discerning as serpents, and pure as doves.
And hold ye from men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their assemblies will they scourge you.
And ye shalt be brought before leaders and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.
And when they deliver you up, have no care how or what ye should speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak.
For ye yourselves are not speaking, but the spirit of your father speaking in you.
And brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child: and children shall rise up in revolt against parents, and kill them.
And ye shall be hated by all for my name: and he having remained to the end shall be saved.
And when they drive you out in this city, flee ye to another; for verily I say to you, Ye shall not finish the cities of Israel till the Son of man come.
The disciple is not above the teacher, nor the servant above his lord.
Sufficient to the disciple that he be as his teacher, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzeboul, how much more those pertaining to his household?
Therefore fear them not; for nothing has been covered, which shall not be revealed; and concealed, that shall not be known.
What I say to you in darkness, speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, proclaim upon the houses.
And fear not from those killing the body, and not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him able to destroy also soul and body in hell.
Are not two little sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the earth without your Father.
And also the hairs of your head are all numbered.
Fear not therefore; ye have the preeminence over many sparrows.
Every one therefore who shall agree with me before men, I also will agree with him before my Father, him in the heavens.
But whoever should deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father, him in the heavens.
Think not that I came to cast peace upon earth; I came not to cast peace, but a sword.
For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the bride against her mother-in-law.
And a man's enemies, they pertaining to his household.
He loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of me; and he loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of me.
And whoever takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.
He finding his soul shall lose it; and he having lost his soul for my sake shall find it.
He receiving you, receives me; and he receiving me, receives him sending me.
He receiving a prophet in a prophet's name, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he receiving the just in the name of the just, shall take the reward of the just.
And whoever should give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.
And it was when Jesus finished ordering his twelve disciples, he went away from thence to teach and proclaim in all their cities.
And John having heard in prison the works of Christ, having sent two of his disciples,
He said to him, Art thou he coming, or should we look for another?
And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye hear and see:
The blind receive sight, and the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, and the deaf bear, the dead are roused, and the poor have good news announced.
And happy is he who shall not give cause of offence in me.
And these going forth, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what went ye out to see? A man clad in soft garments? but they having soft things are in king's houses.
But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more eminent than a prophet.
For this is he for whom it was Written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
Verily I say to you, in the begotten of women has there not risen a greater than John the Immerser; but the less in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
From the days of John the Immerser till now the kingdom of the heavens is achieved by force, and they committing violence seize it eagerly.
For all the prophets, And the law prophesied till John.
And if ye will receive, this is Elias he about to come.
He having ears to hear, let him hear.
To what shall I liken this generation I it is like little boys sitting in market-places, and calling to their companions,
And saying, We played the flute to you, and ye moved not; we lamented to you and ye lamented not.
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has an evil spirit.
The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man a glutton, and wine drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful; and wisdom has been justified from her children.
Then began he to blame the cities in which were his greatest powers, because they repented not.
Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon had been the powers being in you, long since had they repented in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, To Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.
And thou, Capernaum, lifted up even to heaven, thou shalt he brought down to hades: for if in the people of Sodom had been the powers being in thee, they had remained till this day.
But I say to you, That to the land of Sodom it shall be more supportable in the day of judgment, than to you.
In that time Jesus having answered, said, I acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for thou hast hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to children.
Yes, Father: for so was it benevolence before thee.
All things were delivered to me by my Father; and none knows the Son, except the Father; nor knows any one the Father, except the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal.
Come to me, all ye wearied and loaded, and I will cause you to rest.
Lift up my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and humble in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.
For my yoke is useful, and my load is light.
In that time Jesus went in the sabbaths through the standing corn and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears, end eat.
And the Pharisees, seeing, said to him, Behold, thy disciples do what is not lawful to do in the sabbath.
And he said to them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was hungry, and they with him;
How he went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of setting up, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor those with him, but for the priests alone?
Or have ye not read in the law, that in the sabbaths, the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are innocent?
But I say to you, That he here is greater than the temple.
And if ye knew what it is, I will mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the innocent.
For the Lord of the sabbath is also the Son of man.
And having passed from thence, he went into their assembly;
And, behold, there was a man having the hand withered. And they asked him saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbaths? that they might expose him.
And he said to them, Which of you shall be the man who shall have one sheep, and if this should fall into a pit in the sabbaths, will he not take hold of it, and raise it up?
How much then does a man surpass a sheep? So that it is lawful to do well in the sabbaths.
Then says he to the man, Stretch out thy hand; and he stretched it out; and it was restored, sound as the other.
And the Pharisees took counsel against him, having gone out, that they might kill him.
And Jesus having known, withdrew from thence; and many crowds followed him, and he cured them all;
And he rebuked them that they should not make him known:
So that that spoken by the prophet Esaias might be completed, saying,
Behold my servant, which I have chosen: my dearly beloved, in whom my soul was contented; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall proclaim judgment to the nations.
He shall not contend, nor cry; nor shall any hear his voice in the streets.
He shall not break a bruised reed, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he should draw forth judgment to victory.
And in his name shall the nations hope.
Then he possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb, was brought to him; and he cured him, so that the blind and dumb spake and saw also.
And all the crowds were affected, and said, Is not this the son of David?
But the Pharisees, having heard, said, He casts not out demons, but by Beelzebub, ruler of demons.
And Jesus knowing their reflections, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.
And if Satan casts out Satan, he was divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
And I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast out? for this shall they be your judges.
But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out demons, the kingdom of God has come before hand upon you.
Or how can any one come into the house of the strong, and plunder his goods, except be first bind the strong? and then he will plunder his house.
He not being with me is against me; and he not gathering with me; scatters.
For this I say to you, All sin and blasphemy shall be let go to men; but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be let go to men.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be let go to him, neither in this time, nor that about to be.
Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree rotten, and its fruit rotten; for the tree is known by its fruit.
O generation of vipers! how can ye speak good things, being evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the month speaks.
The good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, casts forth good things: and the evil man, out of the evil treasure, casts forth evil things.
And I say to you, That every idle word which men speak, they shill return word for it in the day of judgment.
For by thy words shalt thou be justified, and by thy words shalt thou be condemned.
Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from thee.
And he having answered, said to them, An evil generation and an adulteress seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
The Ninevite men shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas here.
The queen of the South shall be raised up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the end of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon here.
And when the unclean spirit has gone out from a man, he passes through sterile places, seeking rest, and finds not.
Then says he, I will return into my house, whence I came out; and having come, he finds vacant; having been swept, and put in order.
Then he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits, worse than he, and having come in, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first. So also shall it be to this evil generation.
And he yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
And a certain one said to him, Behold, thy mother, and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
And he having answered, said to him speaking to him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?
And having stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
For whoever should do the will of my Father, him in the heavens, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
And in that day Jesus, having come out of the house, sat by the sea.
And many crowds were assembled together to him; therefore having entered into the ship, he sat down, and all the crowd stood upon the sea-shore.
And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, he, the sower, went forth to sow.
And in his sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things came and swallowed them down.
And others fell upon rocky places where it had not much earth, and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no depth of earth.
And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and for the not having a root, it was dried up.
And others fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.
And others fell upon good earth and gave fruit, some truly a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.
He having ears to hear let him hear.
And the disciples having come near, said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?
And having answered, he said to them, For to you it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it was not given.
For whoever has shall be given to him, and he shall have in excess; and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
For this I speak to them in parables: for seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
And the prophecy of Esaias is filled up in them, saying, In hearing shall ye hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.
For the heart of this people has been thickened, and with their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest perhaps they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.
But happy your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.
For verily I say to you, that many prophets and just desired eagerly to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.
Therefore hear ye the parable of him sowing.
Every one hearing, and not understanding, the evil one comes, and carries off that sown in his heart. This is he having sown by the way.
And he having sown upon rocky places, this is he hearing the word, and quickly with joy receiving it;
And has no root in himself, but is for a time; and there being pressure or expulsion for the word, straightly is he offended.
And he having sown among thorns, this is he hearing the word; and the care of this time, and the deceit of riches, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.
But he having sown upon good earth is he hearing the word, and understanding; who indeed bears fruit, and who makes truly a hundred, and who sixty, and who thirty.
Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens was made like a man sowing good seed in his field:
And in men's sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
And when the grass sprouted up and made fruit, then appeared the tares also.
And the servants of the master of the house having come, said to him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence therefore has it tares?
And he said to them, A man, an enemy, has done this: and his servants said to him, Wilt thou therefore we, having departed, should gather them.
And he said, No; lest gathering the tares, ye root up the wheat together with them.
Suffer both to grow together till harvest; and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; and gather the wheat into my barn.
Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a kernel of mustard, which a man taking, sowed in his field:
Which truly is less than all seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than vegetables, and becomes a tree, so that the flying things of heaven come and lodge in its young shoots.
Another parable spake he to them; The kingdom of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, till the whole was leavened.
All these things spake Jesus in parables to the crowds; and without a parable spake he not to them.
So that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up; saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare things having been hid from the foundation of the world.
Then Jesus having dismissed the crowds, went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
And he having answered, said to them, He sowing the good seed is the Son of man:
And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;
And the enemy having sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of time; and the reapers are the messengers.
As therefore the tares are gathered together and burnt in fire; so shall it be in the end of this time.
The Son of man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and those doing iniquity;
And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then shall the just emit a brilliant light as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He having ears to hear, let him hear.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a treasure hid in the field; which a man finding, concealed, and from his joy, he retires, and all things which he has he sells, and he purchases that field.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a wholesale merchant, seeking beautiful pearls:
Who, finding one pearl of great value, having departed, he sold all things which he had, and purchased it.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a large sweep-net, cast into the sea, and having gathered of every kind:
Which when it was filled, having raised up upon the shore, and having set down, they gathered the good things into vessels, and the rotten things they cast without.
So shall it be in the end of time; the messengers shall come forth, and separate the evil from the midst of the just,
And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these? They say to him, Yes, Lord.
And he said to them, Therefore every scribe, having been a disciple in the kingdom of the heavens, is like to a man, master of a house, who casts out from his treasure new things and old.
And it was when Jesus finished these parables, he removed thence.
And having come into his native land, he taught them in their assembly, so that they were struck with amazement, and said, Whence to him this wisdom, and powers?
Is not this the son of the carpenter? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then to him all these?
And they were scandalized in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in his house.
And he did not many powers there, because of their unbelief.
In that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,
And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; be was aroused from the dead; and for this, powers are energetic in him.
For Herod, having seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias, his brother Philip's wife:
For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her:
And wishing to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, because they held John as a prophet.
The festivities of Herod's birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
Wherefore, with an oath, he agreed to give her whatever she should ask.
And having been urged on by her mother, Give me, she says, here upon a board, the head of John the Baptist.
And the king was grieved: but for his oath, and those reclining together at the table, he ordered to be given.
And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.
And his head was brought upon a board, and given to the girl, and she brought to her mother.
And his disciples having come near, took away the body, and interred it; and having come, they announced to Jesus.
And Jesus having heard, withdrew from thence into a desert place apart: and the crowds, having heard, followed him on foot from the cities.
And Jesus having come, saw a great crowd: and he felt compassion for them, and he cured their sick.
And being evening, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert place, and the time has passed already; loose the crowds, that, having gone into towns, they might purchase food for themselves.
But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart; give ye them to eat.
And they say to him, We have not here but five loaves, and two fishes.
And he said, Bring them here to me.
And having encouraged the crowds to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves, and two fishes, and having looked up to heaven, he praised; and having broken, gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
And they all ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the remaining of fragments, twelve baskets full.
And they eating were five thousand men, besides women and children.
And quickly Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, till he should loose the crowds.
And having loosed the crowds, he went up into a mount apart to pray: and being evening, he was there alone.
And the ship was already in the midst of the sea, overcharged by waves: for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking upon the sea.
And the disciples seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear.
And quickly Jesus spake to them, saying, Take courage; I am; be not afraid.
And Peter having answered him, said, Lord, if thou art, encourage me to come upon the waters.
And he said, Come. And Peter having gone down from the ship, walked upon the waters, to go to Jesus.
And seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me.
And quickly Jesus, having stretched out the hand, laid hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, for what didst thou doubt?
And having gone into the ship, the wind ceased.
And they in the ship, having come, worshipped him, saying, Thou art truly the Son of God.
And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
And the men of the place, having known him, sent into the whole country round about, and brought to him all those having evils:
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were saved from danger.
Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem the scribes and Pharisees, saying,
Wherefore do thy disciples pass by the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
And he, having answered, said to them, Wherefore do ye also pass by the command of God by your tradition.
For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he calumniating father or mother, in death let him die.
And ye say, Whoever should say to father or mother, A gift, whatever thou shouldest be profited by me;
And should not honour his father or his mother. And ye have annulled the command of God by your tradition.
Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
This people draw near me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but their heart keeps off far from me.
But they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines the commands of men.
And having called the crowd, he said to them, Hear ye, and understand.
Not that coming into the mouth pollutes the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this pollutes the man.
Then his disciples having come near, said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were scandalized?
And having answered, he said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.
Let them go: they are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
And Peter, having answered, said to him, Explain to us this parable.
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet destitute of understanding?
Do ye not yet understand, that everything going into the mouth proceeds to the belly, and is cast out in the privy?
But the things going forth out of the mouth come from the heart, and these pollute the man.
For from the heart come forth evil reflections, slaughters, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, defamations:
These are the things polluting a man: but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not a man.
And Jesus, having gone forth from thence, withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
And, behold, a woman, a Canaanite, having come forth from those boundaries, cried out to him, saying, Pity me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is badly possessed with an evil spirit.
And he answered her not a word. And his disciples, having come, asked him, saying, Loose her; for she cries out after us.
And he, having answered, said, I was not sent except to the sheep having been lost, of the house of Israel.
And she, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
And he, having answered, said, It is not good to take the children's bread, and cast it to the little dogs.
And she said, Yes, Lord; for the little dogs also eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their lord.
Then Jesus, having answered, said to her, O woman, great thy faith: let it be to thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.
And having passed from thence, Jesus came to the sea of Galilee; and having gone up into a mountain, he sat there.
And many crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them:
So that the crowds wondered, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they praised the God of Israel.
And Jesus having called his disciples, said, I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain with me three days, and they have nothing they could eat: and I will not leave them fasting, lest they be relaxed in the way.
And his disciples say to him, Whence to us, in a lonely place, so many loaves, to satisfy such a crowd?
And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
And he encouraged the crowd to recline upon the earth.
And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having returned thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
And all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up that remaining of the fragments seven wicker baskets full.
And they eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And having loosed the crowds, he went into a ship, and came into the bounds of Magdala.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.
And he having answered, said to them, It being evening, ye say, Calm weather: for the heaven is fiery red.
And in the morning, Today, wintry weather: for heaven, being sad, is fiery red. Hypocrites, truly ye know to decide the face of heaven, but the signs of the times ye cannot.
An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given her, except the sign of Jonas the prophet. And having left them, he departed.
And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.
And Jesus said to them, Attend and keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we took no loaves.
And Jesus having known, said to them, Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no loaves.
Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of five thousand, and how many baskets ye took?
Nor the seven loaves of four thousand, and how many wicker baskets ye took?
How do ye not understand that I spake not to you concerning bread, to keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
Then understood they that he spake, not to keep from the leaven of bread, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
And Jesus, having come into the parts of Caesarea of Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say me to be, the Son of Man?
And they said, Some, truly, John the Baptist: and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
And he says to them, But whom say ye me to be?
And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.
And Jesus, having answered, said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed to thee, but my Father, he in the heavens.
And I say to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and the gates of hell shall not overcome her.
And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatever thou shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in the heavens: and whatever thou shalt loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens.
Then he enjoined his disciples that they say to none that he is Jesus Christ.
From then Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must depart to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised in the third day.
And Peter having taken him, began to reproach him, saying, Be propitious to thyself, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
And having turned, he said to Peter, Retire behind me, Satan: thou art an offence, to me: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.
Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any wish to come after me, let him deny himself absolutely, and lift up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever should wish to save his life shall lose it: and whoever shall lose his soul for my sake shall find it.
For what is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and injure his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his messengers; and then he will give back to each according to his deed.
Verily I say to you, Some are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart.
And he was transformed before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his garments were white as the light.
And, behold, Moses and Elias were seen to them, conversing with him.
And Peter, having answered, said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make here three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
He yet speaking, behold, a shining cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented; hear ye him.
And the disciples, having heard, fell upon their face, and were greatly afraid.
And Jesus, having come, touched them, and said, Be raised, and be not afraid.
And having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone.
And they, coming down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the sight to none, even till the Son of man rises from the dead.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?
And Jesus having answered, said to them, Elias truly comes first and will re-establish all things.
And I say to you, That Elias has already come, and they knew him not, but did by him whatever they would. So also the Son of man is about to suffer by them.
Then understood the disciples that he told them of John the Baptist.
And they having come to the crowd, there came to him a man, supplicating on his knees to him, and saying,
Lord, pity my son: for he is a lunatic, and suffers badly: for many times he falls into the fire, and many times into the water.
And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
And Jesus, having answered, said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I endure you? bring him here to me.
And Jesus censured him; and the demon went forth out of him: and the child was cured from that hour.
Then the disciples having come to Jesus apart, said, Why could not we cast it out?
And Jesus said to them, For your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If ye have faith as a kernel of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Go away from thence, and it shall go away; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
But this kind goes not forth but by prayer and fasting.
And they having returned into Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men:
And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised. And they were greatly grieved.
And they having come to Capernaum, they taking double drachmas came to Peter and said, Does not your teacher pay double drachmas?
He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What seems to thee, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take taxes or census? from their sons, or from strangers?
Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the children free.
But that we should not scandalize them, having gone to the sea, cast a fish hook, and lift up the fish coming up first, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a gold coin: having taken that, give to them for me and thee.
In that hour came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens?
And Jesus, having called a young child, set it in the midst of them,
And said, Truly I say to you, Except ye be turned, and become as young children, ye should not come into the kingdom of the heavens.
Whoever, therefore, should be humbled as this young child, the same is the greater in the kingdom of the heavens.
And whoever shall receive such a young child in my name, receives me.
And whoever should offend one of these little ones believing in me, it is profitable for him that the millstone of an ass be hung upon his neck, and he be sunk in the midst of the sea.
Woe to the world for offences I for there is necessity for offences to come; but woe to that man by whom the offence comes!
And if thy hand or thy foot give thee cause of offence, cut them off, and cast from thee: it is good for thee to come into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.
And if thine eye give thee cause of offence, take it out, and east from thee: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire.
See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That their messengers in the heavens always behold the face of my Father which is in the heavens.
For the Son of man has come to save the lost.
What does it seem to you? if there be to any man a hundred sheep, and one of them have been led astray, does he not, having left the ninety-nine upon the mountains, having gone, seek the one led astray?
And if it be found, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over it, than over the ninety-nine not led astray.
So is not the will of your Father, he in the heavens, that one of these little ones be lost.
And if thy brother sin against thee, retire, and refute him between thee and him alone; if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
But if he hear thee not, take with thee yet one or two, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might stand.
And if he refuse hearing them, speak to the church: and if he refuse hearing the church, let him be to thee as of the nations and a publican.
Truly I say to you, Whatever things ye should bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever things ye should loose upon earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Again, I say to you, That if two of you agree in opinion for everything which they ask, it shall be to them of my Father, he in the heavens.
For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
Then Peter, having come to him, said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I let him go? Till seven times?
And Jesus says to him, I say not to thee, till seven times; but till seventy times seven.
Therefore the kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, the king, who wished to lift up the word together with his servants.
And he having begun to settle accounts, one was brought him, a debtor of ten thousand talents.
And he not having to give back, his lord ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children, and all which he had also to be given back.
Then the servant, having fallen, worshipped him, saying, Lord, be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.
And the lord of that servant, having felt compassion, loosed him, and let go to him the money lent.
But that servant having come, found one of his fellow-servants who owed him one hundred drachmas, and having seized, he choked him, saying, Give back to me what thou owest.
Then his fellow-servant having fallen at his feet besought him, saying, Be slow to anger towards me, and I will give back all to thee.
And he would not; but having departed he cast him into prison till he should give back that being owed.
And his fellow-servants having seen the thing done, were greatly grieved, and having come, made known to their lord all things done.
Then his lord, having called him, said unto him, O thou evil servant, I let go to you all that debt since thou besoughtest me:
Oughtest thou not also to pity thy fellow-servant, as I also pitied thee.
And his lord having become angry, delivered him to the torturers even till he should give back all being owed to him.
So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if ye let not go each to his brother from your hearts their falls.
And it was when Jesus finished these words he removed from Galilee, and came from the bounds of Judea beyond Jordan;
And many crowds followed him; and he cured them there.
And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to loose his wife for every cause.
And having answered, he said to them, Have ye not read, that he having made from the beginning, made them male and female,
And said, For this shall a man leave father and mother, and be joined to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?
So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has yoked together, let not man separate.
They say to him, Why then did Moses charge to give a writing of divorce, and loose her?
He says to them that Moses for your hard heart permitted you to loose your wives: and from the beginning it was not so.
And I say to you, That whoever should loose his wife, except for fornication, and marry another, commits adultery; and he having married the one loosed commits adultery.
His disciples say to him, If the cause of a man is so with the woman, it is not profitable to marry.
And he said to them, All have not room for this word, but to whom it is given.
For there are eunuchs, who were born so from the mother's belly: and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to receive, let him receive.
Then young children were brought to him, that he might put hands upon them and pray: and the disciples censured them.
But Jesus said, Let go the young children, and hinder them not, to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
And having put hands upon them, he went out from thence.
And, behold, one having come said to him, Good teacher, what good shall I do, that I might have eternal life?
And he said to him, Why sayest thou me good? None is good except one, God; but if thou wouldst come into life, keep the commands.
He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, thus: Thou shalt not murder; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;
Honour thy father and mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
The young man says to him, All these have I watched from my youth; what yet do I want?
Jesus said to him, If thou wished to be perfected, retire, sell thy possessions, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
And the young man having heard the word, departed, being grieved: for he was holding many possessions.
And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That with difficulty shall a rich one come into the kingdom of the heavens.
And again I say to you, It is of easier labor for a camel to pass through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
And his disciples were greatly struck with amazement, saying, Who then can be saved?
And Jesus having looked up said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Then Peter having answered, said to him, Behold, we have let go all things, and have followed thee; what therefore shall be to us?
And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, That ye having followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man should sit upon the throne of his glory, shall be seated ye also upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And every one who lets go houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for the sake of my name, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.
And many first shall be last, and the last first.
For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, master of a house, who went out as soon as morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
And having agreed for a drachma a day, he sent them to his vineyard.
And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the market-place,
And he says to them, Retire ye also into the vineyard, and whatever should be just I will give you: and they departed.
Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
And about the eleventh hour, having gone out, he found others standing idle, and he says to them, Why stand ye here idle the whole day?
They say to him, That none has hired us. He says to them, Retire also to the vineyard; and whatever be just, ye shall receive.
And it being evening, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen, and give back to them the wages, beginning from the last even to the first.
And they of the eleventh hour having come, thereupon received a drachma.
And the first, having come, thought that they will receive more; and they also received thereupon a drachma.
And having received, they murmured against the master of the house,
Saying, That these last worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, having borne the burden and heat of the day.
And he, having answered, said to one of them, Friend, I injure thee not; didst not thou agree with me for a drachma?
Take thine and retire: and I will to give to this last, as also to thee.
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my things? Or is thine eye evil because I am good.
So shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen.
And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and he said to them,
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,
And they shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and scourge, and crucify: and he shall be raised the third day.
Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, worshipping, and asking something of him.
And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Say that these my two sons might sit, the one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.
And Jesus having answered, said, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion which I am immersed? They say to him, We can.
And he says to them, Truly my cup shall ye drink, and with the immersion which I am immersed shall ye be immersed; but to sit on my right, and on my left, is not mine to give, but to those it was prepared for by my Father.
And the ten having heard, felt pain about the two brethren.
But Jesus, having called them, said, Ye know that the rulers rule over their nations, and the great exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you; but whoever should wish to be great among you, let him be your attendant;
And whoever would be first among you, let him be your servant:
As the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.
And they going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
And, behold, two blind sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.
And the crowd censured them that they should be silent: but they cried the more, saying, Pity us, O Lord, son of David.
And Jesus having stood, called them, and said, What will ye I shall do to you?
They say to him, Lord, that our eyes might be opened.
And Jesus, having felt compassion, touched their eyes: and quickly their eyes looked up, and they followed him.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, saying to them,
Go ye into the town opposite to us, and quickly shall ye find an ass bound, and a colt with her; having loosed, bring to me.
And if any one say to you, Why? ye shall say, That the Lord has need of them; and quickly will he send them.
And the whole of this was, that that spoken by the prophet be completed; saying,
Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy king comes to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and a colt, son of a beast of burden.
And the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus commanded them,
Brought the ass, and colt, and put on them their garments, and he sat over them.
And a very great crowd strewed their garments in the way; and others cut down young shoots from the trees, and strewed in the way.
And the crowds leading before, and following, cried, saying, Osanna to the son of David: he coming in the name of the Lord being praised; Osanna in the highest ones.
And he having come to Jerusalem, all the city was shaken, saying, Who is this?
And the crowds said, This is Jesus, the prophet, from Nazareth of Galilee.
And Jesus came into the temple of God, and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the money-changers tables, and the seats of those selling doves,
And he says to them, It was written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; and ye have made it a den of robbers.
And the blind and lame came to him in the temple; and he cured them.
And the chief priests and scribes, seeing the wonderful things which he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Osanna to the son of David; they felt pain.
And they said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus says to them, Yes; have ye never read, That out of the mouths of young children and sucklings thou hast adjusted praise?
And leaving them, he went without the city, to Bethany; and lodged there.
And in the morn, having returned into the city, he hungered.
And having seen one fig tree by the way, he came to it, and found nothing on it, except leaves only; and he says to it, Let no more fruit be from thee forever. And instantly the fig tree was dried up.
And the disciples, seeing, wondered, saying, How suddenly was the fig tree dried up!
And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Truly I say to you, if ye have faith, and be not removed, ye shall do not only that of the fig tree, but also to this mountain, if ye should say, Be thou lifted up, and cast into the sea, it shall be.
And all things, whatever ye ask in prayer, believing, shall ye receive.
And to him, having come into the temple to him teaching, came the chief priests and elders of the people, saying, By what authority doest thou these? and who gave thee this authority?
And Jesus, having answered, said to them, I will also ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these.
The baptism of John, whence was it of heaven or of men And they reasoned by themselves, saying, If we say, of heaven; he will say to us, Why, then, believed ye him not?
But if we say, of men; we fear the crowd; for all hold John as a prophet.
And having answered Jesus, they said, We know not. And he said to them, Neither do I say to you, by what authority I do these.
But what seems to you A man had two children; and having come to the first, he said, Child, retire today, work in my vineyard.
And he, having answered, said, I will not; but afterward, having felt regret, he departed.
And having come to the second, he said likewise. And he, having answered, said, I, Lord: and he departed not.
Which of the two did the father's will? They say to him, The first. Jesus says to them, Truly I say to you, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.
For John came to you in the way of justice, and ye believed him not: and the publicans and harlots believed him; and ye, seeing, repented not afterwards, to believe him.
Hear another parable: A certain man was master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around it, and digged in it a winepress, and let it out to farmers, and went abroad:
And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his parts.
And the farmers having taken his servants, truly one they stripped, and one they killed, and one they stoned.
Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did to them likewise.
And afterwards he sent to them his son, saying, They will be changed by my son.
And the farmers, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and possess his inheritance.
And having taken, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.
When, therefore, the lord of the vineyard should come, what will he do to those farmers?
They say to him, He will miserably destroy these wicked, and let out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons.
Jesus says to them, Have ye never read in the writings, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner? This was from the Lord, and it was wonderful in your eyes.
For this I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation doing its fruits.
And he falling upon this stone shall be crushed: but upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.
And the chief priests and Pharisees, having heard his parable, knew that he spake of them.
And seeking to lay hold on him, they feared the crowd, since they held him as a prophet.
And Jesus, having answered, spake to them in parables, saying,
The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a nuptial feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to those having been called to the nuptial feast: and they would not come.
And again, he sent other servants, saying, Say to the called: Behold, I have prepared my supper; my bulls and stall-fed killed, and all prepared: come to the nuptials.
And they, not having heeded, departed, one truly to his own field, and one to his traffic:
And the rest, having seized his servants, were insolent, and killed them.
And the king, having heard, was angry, and having sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
Then says he to his servants, Truly the nuptial feast is prepared, and those called were not worthy.
Go ye, therefore, to the passages of the ways, and as many as ye should find, call to the nuptial feast.
And those servants, having come to the ways, gathered together all, as many as they found, also both the evil and good, and the nuptial feast was filled with the reclining.
And the king, having come in to behold the reclining, saw there a man not clad with the garment of the wedding:
And he says to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a garment of the nuptial feast? And he was muzzled.
Then said the king to his servants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him away, and cast ye him into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
For many are called, and few chosen.
Then the Pharisees, having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in word.
And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and care is to thee for none; for thou lookest not to the face of men.
Therefore say to us, What seems to thee Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus, having known their evil, said, Why tempt ye me, hypocrites?
Show me the piece of money of tribute. And they brought him a drachma.
And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?
They say to him, Caesar's. Then says he to them, Give back then to Caesar the things of Caesar; and the things of God to God.
And having heard, they wondered, and having left him, they departed.
In that day the Sadducees came to him, they saying there is to be no rising up: and they asked him,
Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
And with us were seven brethren: and the first, having married, died; and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother.
And likewise the second, and third, even till the seven.
And after all died also the woman.
Therefore in the rising up whose of the seven shall the woman be? for they all had her.
And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Ye are led astray, not having known the writings, nor the power of God.
For in the rising up they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers of God in heaven.
And for the rising up of the dead, read ye not that spoken by God, saying,
I am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And the crowds having heard, were astonished at his teaching.
And the Pharisees having heard that he muzzled the Sadducees, were gathered upon the same.
And one of them, skilled in the law, asked, tempting him, and saying,
Teacher, which the great command in the law?
And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.
This is the first and the great command.
And the second like it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
In these two commands hang the whole law and the prophets.
And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Saying, What seems to you about Christ? Whose son is he They say to him, David's.
He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right, till I make thine enemies the footstool of my feet.
If, therefore, David calls him Lord, how is he his son.
And none could answer him a word, nor dared any one from that day to ask him any more.
Then spake Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples,
Saying, Upon Moses' seat sat the scribes and Pharisees.
Therefore all whatever they say to you to keep, keep and do; and according to their works do not, for they say and do not.
For they bind loads heavy and difficult to carry, and put upon men's shoulders; and with their fingers will they not move them.
And all their works do they, to be seen by men: and make broad their preservatives, and enlarge the border of their garments.
And love the first place at suppers, and the first seat in the assemblies,
And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
And be ye not called Rabbi: for one is your guide, Christ; and all ye are brethren.
And call not your father upon earth: for one is your Father, which in the heavens.
Nor be ye called leaders, for one is your Leader, Christ.
And the greater of you shall be your servant.
And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled; and whoever shall humble himself, shall be exalted.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye lock up the kingdom of the heavens before men: for ye come not in yourselves, neither those coming in, permit ye to come in.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for pretence, praying at great lengths; for this shall ye receive more distinguished judgment.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees hypocrites! for ye go about sea and dry land to make one proselyte, and when he should become, ye make him the son of hell, twofold more than you.
Woe to you blind guides, saying, Whoever should swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever should swear by the gold of the temple, he is indebted!
Foolish and blind; for which is the greater, the gold, or the temple consecrating the gold?
And, Whoever should swear by the altar, it is nothing; and whoever should swear by the gift above it, he is indebted.
Foolish and blind: for which is the greater, the gift, or the altar, consecrating the gifts?
Therefore, he having sworn by the altar, swears by it, and by all above it.
And he having sworn by the temple, swears by it, and by him dwelling in it.
And he having sworn by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him sitting above it.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye exact tenths and dill and cummin, and ye have left the weightier things of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith: these it was necessary to do, and not to let go those.
Blind guides, straining a gnat, and swallowing down a camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup, and the side dish of sweet-meats, and within they are full of pillage and bad mixture.
O blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup, and side dish of sweetmeats, that also their outside might be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whitewashed tombs, which without indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of the bones of the dead, and of all uncleanness.
So also ye without truly appear just to men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and deck the monuments of the just,
And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we had not been their partakers in the blood of the prophets,
Wherefore ye bear testimony to yourselves, that ye are the sons of those having slain the prophets.
And fill ye up yourselves the measure of your fathers.
Serpents, generations of vipers, how would ye flee from the judgment of hell?
Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets, and the wise, and scribes: and of them shall ye kill and crucify; and of them shall ye chastise in your assemblies, and drive out from city to city,
So that all the just blood shed upon the earth might come upon you, from the blood of just Abel to the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye killed between the temple and altar.
Truly I say to you, All these shall come upon this generation.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and stoning those sent to her; how often did I wish to gather thy children together, which manner a bird gathers together her young broods under the wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I say to you, Ye should not see me from henceforth, till ye should say, Praised be he coming in the name of the Lord.
And Jesus having gone out, went out of the temple: and his disciples came near to shew him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these? truly I say to you, Stone upon stone shall not be left here, which shall not be loosened.
And sitting upon the mount of Olives, his disciples came to him apart, saying, Say to us when these shall be, and what the sign of thy arrival, and the termination of the time.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, See lest any lead you astray.
For many shall come upon my name, saying, I am Christ; and deceive many.
And ye will be about to hear of wars and rumors of war: see, be not terrified; for all must be, but the end is not yet.
For nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and plagues, and shakings in places.
And all these the beginning of anguish.
Then shall they deliver you to pressure, and they shall kill you: and ye shall be hated by all nations, for my name.
And then shall many be offended, and they shall deliver up one another, and they shall hate one another.
And many false prophets shall be raised up, and deceive many.
And because anxiety shall increase, the love of many shall be cooled.
But he having persevered to the end, this shall be saved.
And this good news of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole habitable globe for a witness to all nations: and then shall the end come.
Therefore, when ye see the abomination of devastation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, (let him reading, understand:)
Then let them in Judea flee to the mountain;
He upon the house-tops, let him not come down to take away anything out of his house:
And he in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garments:
And woe to those having in the womb, and to those giving suck, in those days!
And pray that your flight be not in winter, nor in the sabbath.
For then shall be great pressure, such as has not been from the beginning of the world till now, nor should be.
And except those days had been shortened, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen, those days shall be shortened.
Then if any say to you, Behold, here Christ, or there; believe ye not.
For false Christs, and false prophets, shall be raised up, and give great signs and wonders; so as to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.
Behold, I have told you beforehand.
If therefore they should say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth; Behold, in the store-houses, believe ye not.
For as the lightning comes forth from the sunrisings, and shines to the descents; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
For wherever be the fall, there will the eagles be gathered together.
And quickly after the pressure of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall the tribes of the earth lament bitterly, and they shall see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.
And he shall send his messengers, with the great voice of the trumpet, and they shall bring together his chosen from the four winds, from the extremities of the heavens to the extremities.
And from the fig tree learn a parable; When already her young shoot should be tender, and the leaves should spring forth, ye know that summer is near:
So also ye, when ye should see all these things, know ye that it is near at the doors.
Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.
The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words should not pass away.
And concerning that day and hour, none know, nor the messengers of the heavens, except my Father only.
And as the days of Noe, so shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
For as they were in the days of the inundation, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noe came into the ark,
And knew not till the inundation came, and took them all away; so also shall be the arrival of the Son of man.
Then shall be two in the field; one shall be taken, and one is let go;
Two grinding in the mill; one shall be taken, and one let go.
Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord comes.
But know this, that if the master of the house had known what watch the thief comes, he had watched, and would not have suffered his house to be undermined.
Therefore be ye also prepared: for what hour ye think not, the Son of man comes.
Who then is the faithful and discerning servant, which his lord set over his attendance, to give them food in due season.
Happy that servant which his lord, having come, shall find doing thus.
Truly I say to you, That he shall set him over all his possessions.
But if that servant say in his heart, My lord delays to come;
And he should begin to strike the fellow-servants, and to eat and drink with those intoxicated;
The lord of that servant shall come in a day that he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not,
And he shall cut him in two equal parts, and he shall set his portion with the hypocrites: and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who having taken their lanterns, went forth to the meeting of the bridegroom.
And five of them were discerning, and five foolish.
Those foolish having taken their lanterns, took no oil with them.
And the discerning took oil in their vessels with their lanterns.
And the bridegroom delaying, they all slumbered and slept.
And in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go ye forth to his meeting.
Then all these virgins were aroused, and put their lanterns in order.
And the foolish said to the discerning, Give us of your oil; for our lights are quenched.
And the discerning answered, saying, Lest it should not suffice us and you: but go ye rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.
And they, going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they prepared, went in with him to the nuptials; and the door was locked.
And afterwards came also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
And he having answered said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.
Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day, neither the hour, in which the Son of man comes.
For as a man going abroad, called his own servants, and delivered them his possessions:
And to one he truly gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one; to each according to his own power; and he quickly went abroad.
And he having received five talents, having gone, worked with them, and he made other five talents.
Likewise he having the two also, gained he also other two.
And he having received one, having departed, dug in the earth, and concealed his lord's silver.
And after much time the lord of these servants comes, and lifts up the word with them.
And he having received the five talents, having come near, brought the other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst me five talents: and I have gained other five talents.
And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant: thou west faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.
And he also having received the two talents, having come near said, Lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; see, I gained two other talents to them.
His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.
And he also having received one talent, having come near, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou scatteredst not:
And having been afraid, having gone away, I concealed thy talent in the earth; see, thou hast thine own.
And his lord having answered, said to him, O evil and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I scattered not:
Thou therefore oughtest to have cast my silver to the money-changers, and I having come, had received mine own, with interest.
Therefore take the talent away from him, and give him having ten talents.
For to every one having shall be given, and he shall be in abundance: and from him not having, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
And cast ye the useless servant into darkness without; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.
And when the Son of man should come in his glory, and all his holy messengers with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the kids.
And he shall set the sheep from his right, and the kids from his left.
Then shall the king say to them from his right, Come, the praised of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye brought me in:
Naked, and ye put around me: I was sick, and ye reviewed me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.
Then shall the just answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished or thirsting, and gave to drink.
And when saw we thee a stranger, and brought in or naked, and put around.
And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?
And the king having answered, will say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did to one of the least of my brethren, ye did to me.
Then shall he say to them from the left, Go away from me, the cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his messengers:
For I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
I was a stranger and ye brought me not in; naked, and ye put not around me; sick, and in prison, and ye took not a view of me.
Then shall they answer him, they also saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and attended not to thee?
Then shall he answer them saying, Inasmuch as ye did not to one of the least of these, ye did not to me.
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: and the just into eternal life.
And it was when Jesus finished all the words, he said to his disciples.
Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man shall be delivered to be crucified.
Then were gathered together the chief priests, and scribes, and the more ancient of the people, into the court-yard of the chief priest, called Caiaphas,
And they counselled together, that they might obtain Jesus by stratagem, and might kill.
And they said, Not in the festival, lest there should be an uproar among the people.
And Jesus having been in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leprous,
There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of costly perfumed ointment, and she poured upon the head of him, reclining at table.
And his disciples seeing, felt pain, saying, For what this loss?
For this perfumed oil could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.
And Jesus having known, said to them, Why offer ye toils to the woman? for a good work has she worked upon me.
For always the poor ye have with you, but me ye have not always.
For she, casting this perfumed oil upon my body, did to prepare me for interment,
Truly I say to you, Wheresoever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, shall it also be spoken what she did, for a remembrance of her.
Then one of the twelve having gone forth, he being called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
Said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to you? and they placed to him thirty silver coins.
And from then he sought opportunity, that he might deliver him.
And in the first of the unleavened loaves, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou we should prepare for thee to eat the pascha?
And he said, Retire ye into the city, to a certain person, and say to him, The teacher says, My time is near; with thee do I the pascha with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them: and they prepared the passover.
And it being evening, he reclined at table with the twelve.
And they eating, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.
And they being greatly grieved, began each of them to say to him, Far from it am I, O Lord:
And he having answered, said, He having dipped with me the hand in the small dish, the same shall deliver me up.
Truly the Son of man retires as has been written concerning him; and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it was good for him if that man had not been born.
And Judas delivering him up, having answered, said, Far from it, am I, Rabbi? He said to him, Thou hast said.
And they eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and praised, brake and gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
And having taken the cup, and given thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink of it all ye.
For this is my blood, that of the new covenant, having been poured out for many, for the remission of sins.
And I say to you, that I drink not from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, even till that day when I drink it new with you, in the kingdom of my Father.
And having sung, they went forth to the mount of Olives.
Then says Jesus to them, All ye shall be scandalized in me this night; for it has been written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered up and down.
And after I be raised, I will lead before you into Galilee.
And Peter having answered, said to him, And if all men shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.
Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee that in this night, before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Peter says to him, Though it should be necessary for me to die with thee, I will not deny thee: likewise also said all the disciples.
Then comes Jesus with them into the place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here, till I, having gone, shall pray.
And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved, and to be dejected.
Then says he to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch ye with me.
And having gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me: but not as I will, but as thou.
And he comes to his disciples, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, So were ye not able to watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray, lest ye come into temptation: truly the spirit of a ready will, and the flesh weak.
Again of a second time, having gone away, he prayed, saying, My Father if this cup cannot pass away from me except I drink it, let thy will be.
And having gone he finds them again sleeping: for their eyes were loaded.
And having left them, having gone away again, he prayed of the third time, speaking the same word.
Then comes he to his disciples, and says to them, Sleep for the remaining time, and take rest: behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.
Be aroused, let us lead forth; behold, he delivering me up, has drawn near.
And he yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd, with swords, and sticks, from the chief priests, and the more ancient of the people.
And he delivering him up, gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, the same is he: hold him firmly.
And quickly having come to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! and kissed him.
And Jesus said to him, Friend, for what comest thou? Then having come near, they put hands upon Jesus, and held him firmly.
And, behold, one of them with Jesus, having stretched out the hand, pulled out his sword, having struck the chief priest's servant, took away his ear.
Then says Jesus to him, Turn back thy sword to its place: for all they having taken the sword, shall perish by the sword.
Thinkest thou that I am not able to call to my Father for aid, and he will set before me more than twelve legions of messengers?
How then would the writings be filled up, that so it must be?
In that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, As against a robber came ye out, with swords and sticks, to take me? In the day I sat down with you, teaching, and ye took not hold of me.
But this has been wholly that the writings of the prophets might be filled up. Then all the disciples, having left him, fled.
And they having held Jesus, brought to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders were gathered together.
And Peter followed him from far, even to the court-yard of the chief priest, and having entered within, he sat with the attendants, to see the end.
And the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death;
And they found not: and many false witnesses having come near, they found not.
And afterwards two false witnesses, having come near, said, This said, I can loosen the temple of God, and after three days build it.
And the chief priest, having risen, said to him, Answerest thou nothing? what do these witness against thee?
But Jesus was silent. And the chief priest having answered, said to him, I cause thee to swear by the living God, that thou tell us, if thou art Christ, the Son of God.
And Jesus says to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, from henceforth ye shall see the Son of man, sitting from the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the chief priest tore his garments, saying, That he blasphemed: what further need have we of witnesses? see, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
What seems to you? And they having answered, said, He is liable to the penalty of death.
Then did they spit in his face, and cuffed him, and struck him with a rod:
Saying, Prophesy to us, O Christ, Who is he having struck thee.
And Peter sat without in the court-yard, and one young girl came to him saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
And he denied before all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
And he having gone out into the gate, another saw him, and she says to them there, This also was with Jesus the Nazarite.
And again he denied with an oath, That I know not the man.
And a little after, those standing, having come near, said to Peter, Truly thou also art of them; for also thy speech makes thee manifest.
Then began he to anathematize, and to swear, That I know not the man: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, having said to him, That before the cock utter a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice. And having gone forth without, he wept bitterly.
And having been morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to kill him:
And having bound they brought him away, and they delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the leader.
Then Judas, he delivering him up, having seen that he was condemned, having felt regret, returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests, and the more ancient,
Saying, I have sinned, having delivered up guiltless blood. And they said, What to us? thou shalt see.
And having cast down the silver coins in the temple, he withdrew and having gone away, he strangled him self.
And the chief priests, having taken the silver coins, said, It is not lawful to cast them for an offering, since it is the price of blood.
And having taken counsel, they purchased with them the potter's field, for the interment to strangers.
Wherefore, that field was called, The field of blood, even to this day.
Then was completed that having been spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of him prized, whom they from the sons of Israel prized;
And they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.
And Jesus stood before the leader: and the leader asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? Jesus said to him, Thou sayest.
And in the accusing him by the chief priests and the more ancient, he answered nothing.
Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not what they witness against thee?
And he answered him not to one word: so that the leader wondered greatly.
And in the festival the leader was accustomed to loose one imprisoned to the crowd, which they desired.
And they had then an imprisoned distinguished, called Barabbas.
Therefore they assembled together, Pilate laid to them, Whom will ye I shall loose to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, called Christ?
For he knew that through envy, they had delivered him, up.
And he sitting upon the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Nothing to thee and that just one: for I have suffered this day many things in a dream, on his account.
And the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
And the leader having answered, said to them, Which of the two will ye I shall loose to you? And they said, Barabbas.
Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, called Christ? They all say to him, Let him be crucified.
And the leader said, For what evil hath he done? and they cried excessively, saying, Let him be crucified.
And Pilate, seeing that it profits nothing, but there is rather an uproar, having taken water, he washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this just one: ye shall see yourselves.
And all the people having answered, said, His blood upon us, and upon our children.
Then he loosed to them Barabbas: and having scourged Jesus, delivered him up, that, he might be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the leader, having taken Jesus to the Pretorium, gathered together the whole band against him.
And having unclothed him, they put round him a scarlet, loose, warm cloak.
And having twined a crown of thorns, they put upon, his head: and a reed upon his right hand: and having fallen upon the knees before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And having spit upon him, they took the reed, and struck upon his head.
And when they mocked him, they put off from him the loose, warm cloak, and put on him his garments, and brought him away to crucify.
And coming, they found a man, a Cyrenian, Simon by name; they compelled him that he should lift up his cross.
And having come, to the place called Golgotha, which is called the place of the skull,
They gave him vinegar to drink. (mingled with bile: and having tasted, he would not drink.
And having crucified him, they divided his garments among them, casting lot: that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up: They divided among them my garments, and upon my clothing they cast lot.
And sitting down, they observed him there.
And they set above his head his accusation, having been written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Then were crucified with him two robbers; one from the right hand, and the other from the left.
And they coming near, blasphemed him, shaking their heads,
And saying, He loosing the temple, and building in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross.
And likewise also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,
Others he saved; himself he cannot save. If he is King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him:
He trusted upon God; let him now deliver him, if he desires him: for he said, That I am the Son of God.
And the robbers crucified with him, reproached him with the same.
And from the sixth hour, darkness was upon all the earth, even to the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani I this is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
And some of them standing there, having heard, said, That he calls Elias.
And quickly one of them, having run, and taken a sponge, and filled with vinegar, and put upon a reed, gave him to drink.
And the rest said, Let go: we should see if Elias comes, going to save him.
And Jesus, again having cried with a great voice, let go the spirit.
And, behold, the covering of the temple was cleft in two, from above to below; and the earth was shaken; and the rocks were cleft:
And the tombs were opened: and many bodies of the holy ones, having been set to sleep, were raised,
And having come forth from the tombs, after his arising, went into the holy city, and were exhibited to many.
And the centurion, and they with him, observing Jesus, having seen the shaking, and the things having been, were greatly afraid, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
And many women were there, beholding from far off, who followed Jesus out of Galilee, serving him:
Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
And being evening, then there came a rich man from Arimathea, Joseph by name, who also himself was a disciple to Jesus:
He having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given back.
And Joseph having taken the body, inwrapped it in clean fine linen:
And put it in his new tomb, which he quarried in the rock: and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
And in the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate.
Saying, Lord, we remember that that impostor said, yet living, After three days, I arise.
Order therefore, the tomb to be rendered secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, should steal him, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.
And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: retire, render secure as ye know.
And they, having gone, rendered the tomb secure, having sealed the stone with the watch.
And after the sabbaths, in the shining forth to one of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to behold the tomb.
And, behold, there was a great shaking; for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come near, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat above it.
And his aspect was as lightning, and his garment white as snow.
And from fear of him the keepers were shaken, and were as dead.
And the messenger, having answered, said to the women, Be ye not afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus, having been crucified.
He is not here: for he was raised, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
And having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he was raised from the dead; and, behold, he leads before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him: behold I have said to you.
And they having come quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, ran to announce to his disciples.
And as they were going to announce to his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice ye. And they having come, held his feet firmly, and worshipped him.
Then says Jesus to them, Be ye not afraid: retire, and announce to my brethren that they should go away into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
And they going, behold certain of the watch having come to the city, announced to the chief priests all having been done.
And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave sufficient silver coins to the soldiers,
Saying, Say ye, That his disciples having come by night, stole him, we being asleep.
And if this should be beard by the leader, we will persuade him, and we will make you undisturbed.
And they having received the silver coins, did as they were taught; and this word was spread a report by the Jews till this day.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jesus commanded them:
And having seen him, they worshipped him; and some doubted.
And Jesus, having come near, spake to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth:
Therefore, having gone, disciple all nations; immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:
Teaching them to keep all things whatever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even to the end of time. Amen.
The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it has been written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his beaten paths straight.
John was immersing in the desert, and proclaiming the immersion of repentance for the remission of sins.
And the Judean country, and the Jerusalemites, were going out to him, and all were being immersed by him in the river Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
And John was dressed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and eating locusts and wild honey;
And he proclaimed, saying, The stronger than I comes after me, of whom I am not sufficient, having bent the head, to loose the strings of his shoes.
I truly immersed you in water: but he shall immerse you with the Holy Spirit.
And it was in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in Jordan.
And quickly coming up from the water, he saw the heavens cleft asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him:
And a voice was from the heavens; Thou art my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
And directly the Spirit casts him, out into the desert.
And he was there in the desert forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with wild beasts; and messengers were serving him.
And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God,
And saying, That the time has been completed, and the kingdom of God has drawn near: repent ye, and believe in the good news.
And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting a large sweep-net in the sea: for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to become fishermen of men.
And quickly having left their nets, they followed him.
And having moved forward a little from thence, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and they in the ship adjusting their nets.
And quickly he called them: and having left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings; they went after him.
And they go into Capernaum; and quickly in the sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, he taught.
And they were struck with amazement at his teaching; for he was teaching them as having power, and not as the scribes?
And there was in the synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying,
Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy of God.
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.
And the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried with a great voice, came out of him.
And all were amazed, so as to seek out with themselves, saying, What is this? what new teaching this? for with power also he commands the unclean spirits, and they listen to him.
And a report of him went out quickly in the whole country about Galilee.
And quickly, having come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
And Simon's mother-in-law was laid down, affected with fever: and quickly they speak to him concerning her.
And having come, he raised her, having held her hand; and the fever quickly left her, and she served them.
And evening having come, when the sun set, they brought to him all being afflicted, and the possessed with a demon.
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
And be cured many afflicted with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and permitted not the devils to speak, for they knew him.
And early, having risen far in the night, he went out, and departed into a deserted place, and there prayed.
And Simon, and they with him, followed him.
And having found him, they say to him, That all seek thee.
And he says to them, We should lead into the next small cities, that I might proclaim there also: for, for this have I come forth.
And he was proclaiming in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.
And a leprous one came to him, beseeching him, and supplicating him on his knees, and saying to him, That if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.
And Jesus, having felt compassion, having stretched out the hand, touched him, and says to him, I will: be thou cleansed.
And he having spoken, quickly the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
And having threatened him violently, quickly he cast him forth:
And says to him, See thou say nothing to any one: but retire, shew thyself to the priest, and bring forward for thy cleansing what things Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim many things, and to spread the word a report, so that he could no more openly enter the city, but was without in desert places: and they come to him from every quarter.
And again he went into Capernaum after the days; and it was heard that he is in the house.
And quickly many were gathered together, so as no more to have room, neither at the door: and he spake the word to them.
And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, lifted up by four.
And not being able to draw near to him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was and having excavated, they let down his couch upon which the paralytic was laid.
And Jesus having seen their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins have been remitted to thee.
And certain of the scribes were sitting there, and discussing in their hearts,
Why does this thus speak blasphemies? who can remit sins but the one God.
And Jesus quickly having known that they discuss in themselves, says to them, Why discuss ye these things in your hearts.
Why is it easier to say to the paralytic, Sins have been remitted to thee? or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?
And that ye might know that the Son of man has power to remit sins upon earth, (he says to the paralytic)
I say to thee, Arise, and lift up thy couch, and retire to thy house.
And he was quickly raised up; and having lifted up the couch, he went forth before all, so that all were affected in mind, and praised God, saying, That we never saw it thus.
And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.
And passing by, he saw Levi, him of Alpheus, sitting by the customhouse, and he says to him, Follow me. And having risen, he followed him.
And it was in his reclining at table in his house, and many publicans and sinful reclined together with Jesus and his disciples: for they were many, and they followed him.
And the scribes and Pharisees having seen him eating with publicans and sinful, said to his disciples, Why does he eat and drink with publicans and sinful?
And Jesus having heard, says to them, They being strong have no need of a physician, but those being affected: I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
And the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John, and of the Pharisees fast, and the disciples to thee fast not?
And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the nuptial chamber, in which the bridegroom is with them, fast? as much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
And the days shall come when the bridegroom should he taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
And none sews a piece of uncombed fragment upon an old garment; and lest its new filling up take away from the old, and the splitting be worse.
And none puts new wine in old wine-skins: and lest the new wine rend the wine-skins, and the wine be poured out, and the wine-skins perish; but they put new wine in new wine-skins.
And it was he passed by through the standing corn in the sabbaths: and his disciples began to make the way, picking out the ears of corn.
And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they in the sabbaths what is not lawful.
And he said to them, Did ye never read what David did, when he had need, and hungered, himself, and those with him?
How he went into the house of God to Abiathar the chief priest, and ate the loaves of setting up, which is not lawful to eat but for priests, and gave to those being with him?
And he said to them, The sabbath was for man, and not man for the sabbath:
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
And he went again into the synagogue; and a man was there having the hand dried up.
And they were observing him narrowly, if in the sabbaths he will heal him; that they might accuse him.
And he says to the man having the hand dried up, Rise in the midst.
And he says to them, Is it lawful in the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? to save a soul, or to kill? And they were silent.
And having looked round upon them with anger, grieved for the hardness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
And the Pharisees having come out, quickly with the Herodians were making counsel against him, that they might destroy him.
And Jesus withdrew with, his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what he did, came to him.
And he said to his disciples, that a small vessel should remain for him, on account of the crowd, that they might not press him.
For he cured many; so as to fall upon him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.
And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell before him, and cried, saying, That thou art the Son of God.
And he censured them much, lest they should make him manifest.
And he goes up to a mountain, and calls whom he would: and they came to him.
And he made the twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to proclaim,
And have power to cure diseases, and cast out demons:
And he set to Simon the name Peter;
And James, him of Zebedee, and John brother of James; and he set to them names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James him of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
And Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.
And they came into the house; and again came the crowd together, so that they could not even eat bread.
And they with him, having heard, came forth to take hold of him: for they said, That he is affected in mind.
And the scribes, they having come down from Jerusalem, said, That he has Beelzeboul, and that by the ruler of demons he casts out demons.
And having called them, in parables spake he to them, How can Satan cast out Satan.
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
And if Satan rise up against himself, and has been divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
None can plunder the vessels of the strong, having entered his house, except he first bind the strong; then he will plunder his house.
Truly I say to you, That all sins shall be remitted to the sons of men, and defamations whatever they defame:
And whoever should defame against the Holy Spirit has no remission forever, but he is liable to the penalty of eternal condemnation.
For they said, He has an unclean spirit.
Then came his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him.
And the crowd sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee.
And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, and my brethren?
And having looked round upon those sitting round about him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren!
For whoever should do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
And again he began to teach by the sea: and a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that he, having gone into the ship, sat in the sea; and all the crowd was by the sea upon land.
And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in his teaching,
Hear ye; behold, he sowing went out to sow:
And it was in sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things of heaven came and ate it down.
And other fell upon stony places, where it had not much earth; and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no deepness of earth:
And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and because it had no root, it was dried up.
And other fell in thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.
And other fell in good earth, and gave fruit coming up and increasing; and one brought thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
And he said to them, He having ears to hear, let him hear.
And when he was alone, they about him with the twelve asked him of the parable.
And he said to them, To you has it been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those without, all are in parables:
That seeing they might see, and not know; and hearing they might hear, and not understand; lest they turn back, and their sins be remitted to them.
And he says to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all parables?
He sowing sows the word.
And these are they by the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, quickly comes Satan, and takes away the word sown in their hearts.
And these are likewise they sown upon stony places; who, when they hear, quickly with joy receive it;
And have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then pressure having been or expulsion for the word, quickly are they scandalized.
And these are they sown in thorns; these are they hearing the word.
And the cares of this time, and the deceit of riches, and eager desires about remaining things, coming in, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.
And these are they sown on good earth; who hear the word, and receive, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
And he said to them, Much less the light comes that it be set under a bushel, or under a bed; that it be not set upon a candlestick.
For not anything is hid, which should not be manifested; neither was concealed, but that it should come clear.
Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
And he said to them, See ye how ye hear: with what measure ye measure, shall be measured to you: and to you hearing, shall be added.
For whoever should have, to him shall be given: and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;
And he sleep, and should rise night and day, and the seed should sprout, and be raised; how, he knows not.
For the earth bears fruit spontaneously; first the grass, then the ear, then the full wheat in the ear.
But when the fruit should yield, quickly he sends the sickle, for the harvest is brought forward.
And he said, To what should we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable should we hold it forth?
As a kernel of mustard, which, when it be sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds upon the earth:
And when it be sown, it comes up and is greater than all vegetables, and makes great young shoots; so that the flying things of heaven can encamp under its shadow.
And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.
And without a parable spake he not to them: and apart, he solved all to his disciples.
And he says to them in that day, being evening, Let us go beyond.
And having let the crowd go, they receive him as he was in the ship. And there were also other small vessels with him.
And there is a great hurricane of wind, and the waves struck against the ship, so that it was already filled.
And he was upon the back part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow: and they aroused him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?
And having risen, he censured the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent, be constricted. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
And he said to them, Why are ye so timorous? how have ye not faith?
And they feared a great fear, and said to one another, Who is this, that also the wind and sea listen to him.
And they went beyond the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.
And to him coming out of the ship, quickly a man met him from the monuments with an unclean spirit,
Who had a dwelling among the monuments; and neither with chains could any one bind him:
For he had been bound many times with fetters and chains, and the chains were torn asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: and none could tame him.
And always, night and day, was he in the mountains, and among the monuments, crying, and mangling himself with stones.
And having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and worshipped him.
And having cried with a great voice, he said, What to me and thee, Jesus, O Son of God most high I adjure thee by God, that thou torture me not.
For he said to him, Come forth out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
And he asked him, What the name to thee? And he answered, saying, My name, Legion: for we are many.
And he besought him much that he would not send them out of the country.
And a great herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.
And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we might enter into them.
And quickly Jesus permitted them. And the evil spirits having come forth, entered into the swine: and the herd rushed through the precipice into the sea, (and they were about two thousand;) and they were choked in the sea.
And those feeding the swine fled, and they announced in the city, and in the fields. And they came forth to see what is it that was done.
And they come to Jesus, and they see him possessed with the demon, sitting down, and being clothed, and of sound mind: and they were afraid.
And they having seen, recounted to them how it was to him possessed with the demon, and concerning the swine.
And they began to beseech him to depart out of their bounds.
And he having gone into the ship, he having been possessed with a demon besought him that he might be with him.
And Jesus permitted him not; but he says to him, Retire to thy house, to thine own, and announce to them what things the Lord did to thee, and he pitied thee.
And he went away, and began to proclaim in Decapolis what Jesus did to him: and all were wondering.
And Jesus having passed over again in the ship on the other side, a great crowd was gathered together to him: and he was by the sea.
And, behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue comes, Jairus by name; and having seen him, he fell at his feet,
And he besought him much, saying, That my little daughter is at the last extremity: that, having come, thou Mightest put the hands upon her, so that she might be saved; and she shall live.
And he went away with him; and a great crowd followed him, and they pressed him.
And a certain woman, being in a flowing of blood twelve years,
And having suffered many things by many physicians, and having expended all of her own, and not having been benefited, but having come rather to the worse,
Having heard concerning Jesus, having come in the crowd behind, she touched his garment.
For she said, That if I touch his garment, I shall be saved.
And quickly the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she knew in the body that she is healed from the plague.
And Jesus, having quickly known in himself the power having gone out of him, having turned round in the crowd, he said, Who has touched my garments?
And his disciples said to him, Seest thou the crowd pressing thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me?
And he looked round about to see her having done this.
And the woman, afraid and trembling, having known what bad been upon her, came and fell down before him, and spake all the truth to him.
And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has saved thee; retire in peace, and be whole from thy plague.
He yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue, saying, That thy daughter is dead: why yet dost thou importune the Teacher?
And Jesus having quickly heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.
And he permitted not any to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees an uproar, they weeping and wailing much.
And having time in, he says to them, Why make ye an uproar, and weep? the young child is not dead, but sleeps.
And they laughed at him. And he, having cast them all out, takes the father and mother of the young child, and those with him, and goes where the young child was lying.
And having taken the hand of the young child, he says to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Little girl, I say to thee, arise.
And the little girl arose quickly, and walked; for she was of twelve years. And they were affected in mind with great amazement.
And he charged them much that none should know this thing; and he spake to give her to eat.
And he came out thence, and came to his native land; and his disciples follow him.
And sabbath having come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing were struck with amazement, saying, Whence to this one these things? and what this wisdom given to him, that such powers are done by his hands?
Is not this the carpenter, son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Jude, and Simon and are not his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in him.
And Jesus said to them, That a prophet Is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in kinsmen, and in his house.
And he could do no power there, except having laid his hands upon a few sick, he cured.
And he wondered for their unbelief. And he went about the towns teaching.
And he calls the twelve, and began to send them, two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;
And enjoined them, that they take nothing for the way, except a rod only; no traveling-sack, no bread, no brass in the purse:
But bound with sandals; and not clothed with two coats.
And he said to them, Wherever ye come into a house, there remain ye even till ye should come forth thence.
And as many as receive you not, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the heap of dust under your feet for testimony to them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more supportable for the Sodomites or Gomorrhites in the day of judgment, than that city.
And having gone out, they proclaimed that they repent.
And they cast out many demons, and anointed many sick with oil, and they were cured.
And king Herod heard his name; (for it was manifest:) and said, That John the Immerser was raised from the dead, and for this the powers were energetic in him.
Others amid, That he is Elias. And others said, That he is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.
And Herod, having heard, said, That John whom I beheaded, this is he; he was raised from the dead.
For this Herod, having sent, took John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife: for he married her.
For John said to Herod, That it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.
And Herodias had a grudge against him, and desired to kill him; and could not:
For Herod feared John, knowing him a just and holy man, and he observed him: and having heard him, did many things, and heard him cheerfully.
And a convenient day having come, when Herod in the festivities of his birthday made a supper to his leading persons, and to the captains of thousands, and to the first of Galilee;
And the daughter of this Herodias, having come in, and danced, and pleased Herod and those reclining together at table, the king said to the little girl, Ask me whatever thou wishest, and I will give thee.
And he swore to her, That whatever thou shouldest ask, I will give thee, even to half my kingdom.
And she having come out, said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Immerser.
And having come quickly with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I wish that thou wouldest give me by itself, upon a board, the head of John the Immerser.
And the king having been sorely grieved on account of the oaths and those reclining at table together, wished not to refuse her.
And quickly the king, having sent a scout, commanded his head to be brought:
And he having departed, beheaded him in prison, and brought his head upon a board, and gave it to the little girl: and the little girl gave it to her mother.
And his disciples, having heard, came and took up his corpse, and put it in a tomb.
And the sent are gathered to Jesus, and announced to him all things, whatever they did, and whatever they taught.
And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little: for many were coming and returning, and neither had they leisure to eat.
And they departed to a desert place by ship apart.
And the crowds saw them retiring, and many knew him, and they were running there on foot from all cities, and came before them, and came together to him.
And Jesus, having come out, saw a great crowd, and felt compassion for them, for they were as sheep having not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.
And having been already much time, his disciples, having come to him, say, This is a desert place, and already the time much:
Loose them, that having departed to the fields and towns round about, they might buy to themselves loaves: for they have nothing they might eat.
And having answered, he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Having gone, should we buy loaves of two hundred drachmas, and give them to eat?
And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? retire and see. And having known, they say, Five, and two fishes.
And he commanded them all to recline a drinking together, drinking together upon the green grass.
And the borders, the borders reclined, by one hundred, and by fifty.
And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, he praised, and he brake the loaves, and gave to his disciples that they might set before them; and the two fishes he divided to all.
And they all ate, and were satisfied.
And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of fishes.
And they eating the loaves were about five thousand men.
And quickly he constrained his disciples to go to the ship, and to lead before to the other side of Bethsaida, till he loose the crowd:
And having dismissed them, he went away to the mount to pray.
And evening having come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon land.
And he saw them trying to urge forward, for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking upon the sea, and he would pass by them.
And having seen him walking upon the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and cried out:
For all saw him, and were troubled. And quickly he spake with them, and says to them, Take courage: I am; be not afraid.
And he went up to them to the ship; and the wind ceased, and they were greatly affected in mind above measure and wondered.
For they understood not the loaves; for their heart was hardened.
And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret, and put into a harbor.
And they having come out of the ship, quickly having known him.
Running round about that whole country, began to bring the afflicted upon couches, where they heard that he is there.
And wherever he went, in towns, or cities; or fields, they set the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might even touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him were saved.
And the Pharisees are gathered together to him, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,
And having seen some of his disciples with common hands, that is, unwashed, eating loaves, they rebuked.
(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they vigorously wash hands, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
And from the market-place, except they be immersed, they eat not. And there are many other things which they received to hold; the immersion of cups, and of measures, and of brazen vases, and of chairs.)
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Wherefore do not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
And he having answered, said to them, That Esaias prophesied well concerning you, as it has been written, This people honour me with lips, and their heart keeps far from me.
And in vain they revere me, teaching doctrines the commands of men.
For having left the command of God, ye hold firmly to the tradition of men, the immersion of measures and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
And he said to them, Well do ye abrogate the command of God, that ye might keep your tradition.
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and he reviling father or mother, in death let him die:
And ye say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, which is, a gift, whatever thou be profited by me;
And ye permit him to do nothing more for his father or his mother.
Abrogating the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
And having called all the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all ye, and do ye understand:
There is nothing from without a man, entering into him, which can defile him: but things coming out from him, these are the things polluting the man.
If any have ears to hear, let him hear.
And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.
And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.
For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.
And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.
For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,
Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:
All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.
And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.
For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:
And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.
And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children's bread, and cast to little dogs.
And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children's crumbs.
And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.
And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.
And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.
And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.
And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;
And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.
And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.
And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;
And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.
In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,
I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:
And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.
And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?
And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.
And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.
And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.
And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.
And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.
And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.
And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.
And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.
And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.
And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?
Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?
When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.
And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
And he said to them, How do ye not understand.
And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.
And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.
And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.
Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.
And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?
And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.
And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.
And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.
And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.
And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.
And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.
And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.
For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.
Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?
For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.
And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.
And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.
And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.
And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.
And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.
And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.
And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.
And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.
And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.
And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.
And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.
But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.
And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.
And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.
And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?
And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.
And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.
And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.
And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.
And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.
And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.
And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.
And quickly the child's father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.
And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.
And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.
And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.
And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?
And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.
For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.
And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.
And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.
And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.
And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,
Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.
And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.
And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.
For whoever is not against us, is for us.
For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.
And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.
And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:
Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:
Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:
Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.
For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.
And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.
And the Pharisees having come near, asked him, if it is lawful for a man to loose his wife; tempting him.
And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?
And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.
And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.
And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;
And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.
What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.
And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.
And he says to them, Whoever should loose his wife, and should marry another, commits adultery against her.
And if a woman should loose her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.
And they brought young children to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples rebuked those bringing.
And Jesus, having seen, felt pain, and said to them, Permit children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.
And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.
And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.
And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.
Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.
And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.
And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.
And he, being sad at the word, went away being grieved: for he had many possessions.
And Jesus having looked round, said to his disciples, With what difficulty shall they having property enter into the kingdom of God.
And his disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again having answered, says to them, How difficult, children, is it for those trusting in property to enter into the kingdom of God!
It is easier labor for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
And they were struck with amazement, excessively, saying to themselves, And who can be saved.
And Jesus having beheld them says, With men impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.
And Peter began to say to him, Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.
And Jesus having answered, said, Truly I say to you, There is none who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for sake of me, and the good news,
Except he should receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mother, and children, and fields, with expulsions; and in the time coming eternal life.
And many first shall be last; and the last first.
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was leading before them; and they were amazed; and following, they were afraid. And again taking the twelve, he began to say to them the things about to happen to him,
For, behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and scribes; and they shall condemn him to death: and shall deliver him to the nations:
And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall be raised up.
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Teacher, we wish that whatever we should ask, thou wouldst do for us.
And he said to them, What wish you me to do for you?
And they said to him, Give us that we might sit, one from thy right hand, and one front thy left, in thy glory.
And Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink the cup which I drink? and the immersion with which I am immersed to be immersed.
And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Truly the cup which I drink shall ye drink; and the immersion with which I am immersed, shall ye be immersed.
And to sit from my right hand, and from my left is not mine to give; but for whom it has been prepared.
And the ten having heard, began to feel pain about James and John.
And Jesus having called them, says to them, Ye know that they thinking to be first of the nations rule over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.
And it shall not be so among you: but whoever should wish to be great among you, shall be your attendant:
And whoever of you should wish to be the first, he shall be the servant of all.
For also the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul a ransom for many.
And they come into Jericho: and he going out from Jericho, and his disciples, and a sufficient crowd, Bartimeus the blind, son of Timaeus, sat by the way asking alms.
And having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarite, he began to cry, and to say, Son of David, O Jesus, compassionate me.
And many were rebuking him, that he should be silent: and he cried much more, Son of David, compassionate me.
And Jesus having stood, spake for him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Take courage, arise; he calls thee.
And he, having cast away his garment, having risen, came to Jesus.
And Jesus having answered, said to him, What wishest thou I should do to thee? And the blind said to him, Rabboni, that I might see again.
And Jesus said to him, Retire; thy faith has saved thee. And quickly he looked up, and followed Jesus in the way.
And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples,
And says to them, Retire into the town over against you: and quickly going into it, ye shall find a colt tied, upon which none of men has sat; having loosed, bring him.
And if any say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him; and quickly will he send him here.
And they went away, and found the colt tied to the door without by the road, and they loose him.
And certain standing there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
And they said as Jesus charged them: and they let them go.
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon him, and he sat upon him.
And many strewed their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way.
And they going before, and they following, cried, saying, Osanna; praised he coming in the name of the Lord:
Praised the kingdom coming in the name of the Lord of our father David: Osanna in the highest ones.
And Jesus came into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and having looked around upon all things, the hour being already coming, he went into Bethany with the twelve.
And in the morrow, they having come from Bethany, he hungered:
And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if yet he shall find any thing upon it; and having come to it, he found nothing except leaves; for it was not time of the figs.
And Jesus having answered, said to it, May none eat more fruit of thee forever. And his disciples heard.
And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus having entered into the temple, began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those selling doves he overturned;
And he permitted not that any should bring a vessel through the temple.
And he taught, saying to them, Has it not been written, That my house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? and ye made it a den of robbers.
And the scribes and chief priests heard, and they sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the crowd were struck with amazement at his teaching.
And when it was evening, he went without the city.
And in the morning, coming near, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.
And Peter, having recalled to mind, says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is dried up.
And Jesus having answered, says to them, Have the faith of God.
For truly I say to you, That whoever should say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and should not discuss in his heart, but believe that what he says, is; it shall be to him, whatever he should say.
For this I say to you, All things whatever, praying, ye ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.
And when ye stand praying, let go, if ye have any thing against any one: that also your Father, he in the heavens, might let go to you your falls.
And if ye do not let go, neither will your Father, he in the heavens, let go your falls.
And they come again to Jerusalem: and he walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to him,
And say to him, By what power doest thou these things? and who gave thee this power that thou doest these things?
And Jesus having answered, said to them, And I will ask you one word, and answer ye me, and I will tell you by what power I do these things.
Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore did ye not believe him.
But if we say, of men; they feared the people: for all held John, that he was truly a prophet.
And having answered they say to Jesus, We know not. And Jesus having answered, says to them, Neither say I to you by what power I do these things.
And be began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence round, and digged a winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.
And he sent a servant to the husbandmen in time, that he might receive of the husbandmen from the fruit of the vineyard.
And they, taking him, stripped, and sent away empty.
And again he sent to them another servant; and having stoned the same they treated in a summary manner, and sent away despised.
And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; truly stripping some, and killing some.
Yet therefore having one dearly beloved son, and him he sent last to them, saying, That they will be changed by my son.
And these husbandmen said with themselves, That this is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.
And they having taken him, killed, and cast out of the vineyard.
Therefore what will the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.
And have ye not read this writing; The stone which the builders disapproved of, this was for the head of the corner:
This was of the Lord, and is wonderful in our eyes?
And they sought to seize him, and they feared the crowd: for they knew that he spake this parable against them: and having let him go they went away.
And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in the word.
And they having come, say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and thou carest not for any one: for thou lookest not to the face of men, but in truth thou teachest the way of God: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or no?
Should we give, or not give? And he knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a drachma that I might see it.
And they brought. And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, Give back Caesar's things to Caesar, and the things of God to God. And they wondered at him.
And the Sadducees come to him, who say there is no rising up; and they asked him, saying,
Teacher, Moses wrote to us, That if any one's brother die, and leave his wife, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
There were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
And the second took her, and died, and neither left he seed: and the third likewise.
And the seven took her, and left no seed: and the woman died last of all.
Therefore in the rising up, when they should rise, to which of them shall the woman be? for the seven had her a wife.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, For this do ye not go astray, not knowing the writings, nor the power of God?
For when they arise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers which in the heavens.
And concerning the dead that they are raised: have ye not read in the book of Moses, at the bramble, how God spake to him, I the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
He is not God of the dead, but God of the living; ye therefore go astray greatly.
And one of the scribes having come, having heard them seeking out together, knowing that he answered them well, asked him, Which is the first command of all?
And Jesus answered him, That the first of all the commands, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole mind, and from thy whole strength: this the first command.
And the second like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. No other command is greater than these.
And the scribe said to him, Well, Teacher, in truth hast thou spoken: for one God is; and there is no other but he:
And to love him from the whole heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole soul, and from the whole strength, and to love the neighbor as himself, is more than all the whole burnt offerrings, and the sacrifices.
And Jesus having seen him that he answered understandingly, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And none dared to ask him any more.
And Jesus having answered, said, teaching in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David.
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand, till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Therefore David himself calls him Lord; and whence is he his son? And a great crowd heard him willingly.
And he said to them in his teaching, Look from the scribes, wishing to walk in robes, and greetings in market-places,
And first seats in synagogues, and first place at tables in first meals:
They eating in widows' houses, and praying long for a pretext: these shall receive more abundant judgment.
And Jesus having sat over against the royal treasury, saw how the crowds cast money into the treasury: and many rich cast in much.
And one poor widow, having come, cast in two small coins, which is a farthing.
And having called his disciples, he says to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has cast into the royal treasury, more than all they casting into the treasury:
For all they cast in out of the abundance to them; and she, out of her want, cast in all things which she had, her whole living.
And he going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see of what country the stones, and of what country the buildings!
And Jesus having answered, said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? stone upon stone shall not be left which shall not be loosed.
And he sitting in the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him apart,
Say to us, when shall be these things? and what the sign when all these be about to be finished?
And Jesus having answered began to say to them, See ye lest any should lead you astray:
For many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and they shall lead many astray.
And when ye hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not terrified: for it must be; but the end is not yet.
For nation shall be raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in places, and there shall be famines, and commotions: these the beginnings of anguish.
And see ye to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues shall ye be stripped: and shall be set before rulers and kings for my sake, for testimony to them.
And the good news must first be proclaimed to all nations.
And when delivering up, they bring you, take no care beforehand what ye speak, neither bestow attention: but whatever should be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for not ye are speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
And brother shall deliver brother to death, and father child; and children shall rise up against parents, and kill them.
And ye shall be hated by all for my name's sake: and he having remained to the end, the same shall be saved.
And when ye see the abomination of desolation, that spoken by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him reading understand,) then let them in Judea flee to the mountains:
And he upon the house, let him not come down into the house, nor let him come in, to take any thing away out of his house:
And he being in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garment.
And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck in those days!
And pray ye that your flight be not of winter.
For those days shall be pressure, such as there has not been from beginning of creation which God created till now, and should not be.
And except the Lord shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the chosen whom he chose, he shortened the days.
And if any say to you, Behold, here Christ; or, behold, there; believe ye not:
For false Christ's and false prophets shall be raised up, and shall give signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, also the chosen.
But see ye; behold, I have foretold you all things.
But in those days, after that pressure, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
And the stars of heaven shall be falling out, and the powers which in the heavens shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with much power and glory.
And then shall he send his messengers, and gather together his chosen from the four winds, from extremity of earth to extremity of heaven.
And from the fig tree learn ye a parable; When its young shoot be tender, and cause the leaves to grow, ye know that summer is near.
So also ye, when ye see these things done, ye know that it is near at the door.
Truly I say to you, that this generation should not pass away, till all these things should be.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, and my words shall not pass away.
And concerning that day and hour none knows, nor the messengers in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.
See, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
As a man traveling, having left his house, and having given power to his servants, and to each his work, and he commanded the guard of the door that he should watch.
Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house comes, at eve, or midnight, or cock-crowing, or morning.
Lest having come suddenly he find you sleeping.
And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch ye.
And after two days was the pascha, and the unleavened loaves: and the chief priests and scribes sought how, having taken him by fraud, they might kill.
And they said, Not in the festival, lest there be an uproar of the people.
And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leprous, he reclining at table, a woman came having an alabaster box of perfumed oil of persuasive, costly, spikenard; and having broken the alabaster box, she poured upon his head.
And there were some displeased in themselves, and saying, For what has been the loss of this perfumed oil?
For this could have been sold for above three hundred drachmas, and have been given to the poor. And they raged against her.
And Jesus said, Let her go; why bestow ye weariness upon her? she has wrought a good work upon me.
For always have ye the poor with you, and when ye wish ye can do them good: and me ye have not always.
And what she had, she has done: she has undertaken beforehand to perfume my body for the burial.
Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, also what she has done shall be spoken for a memorial of her.
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.
And having heard, they rejoiced, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might opportunely deliver him up.
And in the first day of the unleavened, when they sacrificed the pascha, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou, we, having gone, should prepare that thou eat the pascha.
And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Retire to the city, and a man shall meet you bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow him.
And wherever he should enter in, say to the lord of the house, That the Teacher says, Where is the room where I might eat the pascha with my disciples?
And he will shew you a great apartment spread, ready: there prepare for us.
And his disciples went out, and came to the city, and found as he said to them: and they prepared the pascha.
And having been evening, he comes with the twelve.
And they reclining and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, That one of you shall deliver me up, he eating with me.
And they began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one, What, not I? and another, What, not I?
And he having answered, said to them, One of the twelve, he dipping with me into the small dish.
Truly the Son of man retires, as has been written of him: and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it were good for him if that man had not been born.
And they eating, Jesus having taken bread, having praised, brake, and gave them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
And having taken the cup, having returned thanks, he gave them: and they all drank of it.
And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the new covenant, being poured out for many.
Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
And having sung, they came out to the mount of Olives.
And Jesus says to them, That all ye shall be offended with me in this night: for it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
But after I have risen, I will lead before you into Galilee.
And Peter said to him, And if all shall be offended, yet not I.
And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, That to day, in this night, surely before the cock has uttered a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
And he said more excessively, If I should die with thee, I shall not deny thee. And so likewise they all said.
And they came to a place, the name of which Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit here, while I shall pray.
And he takes Peter and James and John with himself, and began to be amazed, and to be dejected.
And he says to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch.
And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth and prayed that, if it be possible, the hour might pass away from him.
And he said, Abba, Father, all things possible to thee; turn away this cup from me: but not what I will, but what thou.
And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? could eat thou not watch one Hour?
Watch ye and pray, that ye should not come into temptation. Truly the spirit well inclined, and the flesh weak.
And again having gone away, he prayed; saying the same word.
And having turned back, he found them again sleeping, (for their eyes were loaded,) and they knew not what they might answer him.
And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining time, and take rest: it is sufficient, the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.
Arise, and let us lead; behold, he delivering me up has drawn near.
And quickly, he yet speaking, Judas approaches, being one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and scribes and the more ancient.
And he delivering him up gave them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, this is he; seize him, and lead away safely.
And having come, quickly having approached him, he says, Rabbi, rabbi; and kissed him.
And they put their hands on him, and seized him.
And a certain one of them standing by, having drawn a sword, struck the chief priest's servant, and took away his ear.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, As against a robber come ye out, with swords and sticks to take me.
Daily was I with you in the temple teaching, and ye seized me not: but that the writings might be completed.
And having left him, they all fled.
And one certain young man followed him, having cast a garment of fine linen over his nakedness; and the young men seized him:
And having left the fine linen garment, he fled from them naked.
And they led Jesus away to the pontificate: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came with him.
And Peter followed him from far, even to within the court-yard of the chief priest: and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself near the light.
And the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus, to put him to death; and found not:
For many testified falsely against him, and the testimonies were not alike.
And certain having risen up testified falsely against him, saying,
That we heard him saying, That I will abolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will I build another, made without hands.
And neither so was their testimony alike.
And the chief priest having risen up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what these testify against thee.
And he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the chief priest asks him, and says to him, Art thou Christ, Son of the Praised.
And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting from the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
And the chief priest, having rent his tunic, says, What further need have we of witnesses.
Ye have heard the blasphemy; How does it appear to you? And they all condemned him to be liable to the penalty of death.
And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to cuff him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants struck him blows with rods.
And Peter being in the hall how, one of the chief priest's young girls comes:
And seeing Peter warming himself, having looked upon him, she says, And thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.
And he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand what thou sayest. And he went forth without into the vestibule; and the cock uttered a sound.
And the young girl seeing him again, began to say to, them standing by, That this is of them: and again he denied.
And after a little, again they standing by said to Peter, Truly thou art of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like.
And he began to anathematize and swear, That I know not this man of whom ye speak.
And of the second time the cock uttered a sound. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus spake to him, That before the cock utter a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And throwing blame, he wept.
And quickly the chief priests having made counsel with the more ancient and scribes and the whole council, having bound Jesus, led away, and delivered to Pilate.
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou sayest.
And the chief priests accused him much.
And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how much they accuse thee.
And Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
And at the festival he loosed to them one in bonds, whomsoever they asked.
And there was he called Barabbas, bound with those exciting sedition, who did murder in the revolt.
And the crowd having cried, began to ask as he did always to them.
And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye I loose to you the King of the Jews?
For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up:
And the chief priests moved the crowd, that he would rather loose Barabbas to them.
And Pilate having answered, again said to them, What then will ye I should do to him whom ye call King of the Jews?
And again they cried out, Crucify him.
And Pilate said to them, But what evil has he done? And they cried out more excessively, Crucify him.
And Pilate, willing to satisfy the crowd, loosed to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, having scourged, that he might be crucified.
And the soldiers led him away within the hall, which is the Pretorium; and they call together the whole band.
And they clothed him with purple, and put round him, having woven, a thorny crown.
And they began to greet him, Hail, O King of the Jews.
And they struck his head with a reed, and they spit upon him, and having placed the knees, they worshipped him.
And when they mocked him, they put off the purple from him, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him out that they might crucify him.
And they constrain a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, passing by, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might take up his cross.
And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, interpreted, The place of a skull.
And they gave him wine to drink, prepared with myrrh: and he took not.
And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon what any should take up.
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him:
And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed above, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And with him they crucify two robbers; one from the right, and one from the left.
And the writing was completed, saying, And he was reckoned with the lawless.
And they going by blasphemed him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah, thou loosing the temple, and building in three days,
Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
And likewise also the chief priests, mocking to one another with the scribes, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
Let Christ, King of Israel, come down from the cross, that we might see and believe. And they crucified with him reproached him.
And being the sixth hour, darkness was upon the whole earth till the ninth hour.
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, for what hast thou forsaken me?
And some of them standing by, having heard, said, Behold, he calls Elias.
And one running and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put round a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elias will come to take him down.
And Jesus having let go a great voice, expired.
And the veil of the temple was split in two from above to below.
And the centurion, standing over against him, having seen that having so cried out he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son- of God.
And women also were beholding from far: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James the small and the mother of Joses, and Salome;
(And they, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him;) and many other women, having come up with him to Jerusalem.
And being already evening, for it was the preparation, which is before sabbath,
Joseph came from Arimathea, a distinguished counsellor, who also himself was expecting the kingdom of God, having ventured, he went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and having called the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead long ago.
And having known from the centurion, he bestowed the body to Joseph.
And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he rolled in fine linen, and placed him in a tomb, which was quarried out of a rock, and he rolled a stone at the door of the tomb.
And Mary Magdalene and Mari of Joses were beholding where he is laid.
And the sabbath having intervened, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they might anoint him.
And very early in the morning of one of the sabbaths, they came to the tomb, the sun having risen.
And they said to themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
And having looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
And having come to the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, being encompassed with a white robe; and they were terrified.
And he says to them, Be not terrified: Ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, being crucified: he was raised; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.
But retire ye; say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.
And having come forth quickly, they fled from the tomb; and terror and amazement held them: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.
And having risen early the first of the sabbath, he was manifested first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.
She having gone announced to them having been with him, grieving and weeping.
And they having heard that he lives, and was seen by her, believed not.
And after these things, to two of them, walking about, was he manifested in another form, they going into the field.
And they having come announced to the rest: neither did they believe them.
Afterwards to those reclining at table was he manifested, and he reproached their unbelief and hard heart, because they believed not them having seen him raised.
And he said to them, Having gone into all the world proclaim the good news to all creation.
And he having believed and having been immersed shall be saved; but he not having believed shall be condemned.
And these signs shall follow those having believed; In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
They shall take up serpents; and should they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall put hands upon the sick, and they shall be well.
Truly therefore the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into the heavens, and sat on the right hand of God.
And they, having gone forth, proclaimed every where, the Lord performing together, and confirming the word by signs following. Amen.
Since many have undertaken to arrange the narration concerning things rendered perfectly certain among us,
As they delivered to us, who from the beginning being eyewitnesses, and servants of the word;
It seemed fitting to me also, having comprehended all things thoroughly from above, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
That thou mightest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.
There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily order of Abia: and his wife the daughter of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.
And they were both just before God, going faultless in all the commands and precepts of the Lord.
And no child was to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.
And it was in his being priest, in the arranging of the daily order before God,
According to the custom of the priesthood, he drew lots to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the Lord.
And all the multitude of people were praying without at the hour of incense.
And a messenger of the Lord was seen to him, standing from the right of the altar of fumigation.
And Zacharias having seen, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
And the messenger said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy supplication has been heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
And joy shall be to thee, and gladness: and many shall rejoice at his birth.
For he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and fermented liquor he should not drink; and with the Holy Spirit shall he be filled, even from his mother's womb.
And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn back to the Lord their God.
And he shall come before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the intelligence of the just; to prepare a people having been put in order for the Lord.
And Zacharias said to the messenger, By what shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife advanced in her days.
The messenger having answered, said to him, I am Gabriel, standing before God; and was sent to speak to thee, and announce these good news to thee.
And, behold, thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall be, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be completed in their time.
And the people were expecting Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying in the temple.
And having come out, he could not speak to them: and they knew that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he was nodding to them, and remained dumb.
And it was when the days of his service were filled, he departed to his house.
And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and concealed herself five months, saying,
That so has the Lord done to me in days which he looked upon, to take away my reproach among men.
And in the sixth month the messenger Gabriel was sent by God into a city of Galilee, to which the name Nazareth,
To a virgin betrothed to a man to whom the name of Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name Mary.
And the messenger, having come in to her said, Hail, thou made acceptable; the Lord with thee: praised thou among women.
And having seen him, she was troubled at his words, and turned in her thoughts of what country this greeting might be.
And the messenger said to her, Fear not, Mary: thou hast found grace with God.
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.
He shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father:
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
And Mary said to the messenger, How shall this be, since I. know not man?
And the messenger having answered, said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
And, behold, Elizabeth thy kinsman, she also having conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month to her, called barren.
For nothing shall be impossible with God.
And Mary said Behold the servant of the Lord; may it be to me according to thy word. And the messenger departed from her.
And Mary having risen in those days, went into the mountainous country with haste, into a city of Judah;
And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elizabeth.
And it was when Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:
And she called out with a great voice, and said, Praised thou among women, and praised the fruit of thy womb.
And whence this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For, behold, when the voice of thy greeting was in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
And happy she having believed: for a completion of the things spoken shall be to her from the Lord.
And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord.
And my Spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour.
For he looked upon the humiliation of his servant; for, behold, from now shall all generations deem me happy.
For the powerful one has done great things for me; and his name holy.
And his mercy to generations of generations to those fearing him.
He has done strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thought of their heart.
He has pulled down the powerful from thrones, and lifted up the.
He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he sent away empty.
He succored Israel his servant, remembering mercy;
As he spake to our fathers, to Abram, and his seed forever.
And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.
And the time was completed to Elizabeth, for her to bring forth; and she brought forth a son.
And they dwelling near and her kinsmen heard, for the Lord magnified his mercy with her; and they rejoiced with her.
And it was in the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.
And his mother, having answered said, Nay; but he shall be called John.
And they said to her, That there is none among thy kindred who is called by this name.
And they nodded to his father, what he may wish to have him called.
And having asked for a small writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.
And his month was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, praising God.
And fear was upon all dwelling round about them: and in all the mount of Judea all these words were discoursed about.
And all having heard, set in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
And Zacharias his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,
Praised the Lord God of Israel; for he reviewed and he has made a redemption for his people,
And he raised up a horn of salvation to us in the house of David, his servant;
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, from forever:
Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all hating us;
To do mercy with our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:
The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,
To give to us, fearlessly, delivered from the hands of our enemies,
To serve him in sanctity and justice before him all the days of our life.
And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;
To give knowledge of salvation to his people, in remission of their sins.
Through the bowels of mercy of our God; by which the rising of the sun of sublimity has reviewed us,
To shine forth to those in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.
And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing forth to Israel.
And it was in those days an order came out from Caesar Angustus, for the whole habitable globe to be enrolled.
(This enrolling was first, Cyrenius being leader of Syria.)
And all went to be enrolled, each in his own city.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (for he was of the house and family of David:)
To be enrolled with Mary his betrothed wife, being pregnant.

And shepherds were in the country, sleeping in the fields, and watching over their flock the watches of the night.

And the messenger said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I announce you good news, great joy, which shall be to all people.
For this day a Saviour was born to you, who is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.
And this the sign to you; ye shall find the babe swathed, lying in a manger.
And suddenly was there a multitude with the messenger of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,
Glory to God in the highest ones, and upon earth peace, benevolence in men.
And it was when the messenger departed from them into heaven, and the men, the shepherds, said to one another, Let us pass through now to Bethlehem, and see this word done, which the Lord made known to us.
And having hastened, they came and found both Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
And having seen, they made known concerning the word spoken to them about the child.

And he came in the Spirit to the temple: and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus, for them to do according to the custom of the law for him,
And he took him into his arms, and praised God, and said:
Now Lord, thou wilt loose thy servant, according to thy word, in peace:
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples:
A light for the revelation of the nations, and the glory of thy people Israel.
And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken of him.

And not having found him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.
And it was after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of teachers, and hearing them, and inquiring of them.
And all hearing him were affected in mind at his understanding and answers.
And having seen him, they were struck with awe: and his mother said to him, Child, why didst thou so to us? behold, thy father and I, grieving, have sought thee.
And he said to them, For what have ye sought me? knew ye not that among the things of my Father I must be?

And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Then said he to the crowds coming out to be immersed by him, Generation of vipers, who indicated to you to flee from the anger about to come?
Do ye therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say in yourselves, We have a father Abraham: for I say to you, That God is able to raise children to Abraham of these stones.
And also the axe is already laid at the root of the trees: therefore every tree not making good fruit is cut down, and cast into fire.
And the crowds asked him, saying, What therefore shall we do?
And he having answered, says to them, He having two coats, let him impart to him having none; and he having food, let him do likewise.

And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, turned back from Jordan, and was led by the Holy Spirit into the desert,
Being tempted forty days by the devil. And he ate nothing in those days: and they having ended, he afterward hungered.

And Jesus answered to him saying, It has been written, That not by bread alone shall man live, but by every word of God.

And he taught in their assemblies, being honoured of all.
And he came to Nazareth where he was brought up, and he went in, as was the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the assembly, and stood up to read.
And the book of Esaias the prophet was given to him. And having unfolded the book, he found the place where it was written,
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me for which he anointed me to announce good news to the poor; he has sent me to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim a remission to the captives, and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send away with remission the bruised,
To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
And having folded the book and given back to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the assembly were looking attentively upon him.
And he began to say to them, That this day has this writing been filled up in your ears.
And all bore him testimony and wondered at the words of grace going out of his mouth: and said, Is not this the son of Joseph
And he said to them, Directly will ye say to me this proverb, Physician, cure thyself: what things we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
And he said; Truly I say to you, That not any prophet is accepted in his country.
And I tell you of a truth, many widows were in the days of Elias in Israel, When heaven was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine Was upon all the land;
And to none of them was Elias sent, except to Sarepta, of Sidon, to a widow woman.
And many leprous were during Eliseus the prophet in Israel; and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.
And all in the assembly were filled with wrath, hearing these things,
And having risen up, they cast him without the city, and they brought him to the brow of the mount upon which their city was built, to hurt him down.
And he having passed through the midst of them, went away.
And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the sabbaths.
And they were struck with amazement at his teaching: for his word was with power.
And in the assembly was a man having the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a great voice,
Saying, Let alone; what to us and thee, Jesus Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy of God.
And Jesus answered him, saying, Be then silent, and come Out of him. And the demon having thrown him into the midst, came out of him, not having injured him.
And amazement was upon all, and they spake to one another, saying, What this word with authority and power he commands unclean spirits, and they come out.
And a report went forth concerning him into every place of the country round about.
And having risen from the assembly, he went into Simon's house. And Simon's mother-in-law was taken with a great fever; and they entreated him for her.
And having stood over her, he censured the fever: and it left her: and having risen immediately she served them.
And the sun setting, all as many as had sick ones with various diseases brought them to him; and he having put hands upon each one of them, cured them.
And demons came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And answering he suffered them not to speak, for they knew him to be Christ.
And it having been day, having gone forth he went into a deserted place: and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and detained him not to go from them.
And he said to them, That also to other cities must I announce the good news, the kingdom of God: because for this have I been sent.
And he was proclaiming in the assemblies of Galilee.
And it was the crowd pressing close upon him to hear the word of God, and he was standing near the lake of Gennesaret,
And he saw two ships standing near the lake: and the fishermen having gone out of them, washed the fishing-nets.
And having gone into one of the ships, which was Simon's, he asked him to sail out a little from land. And having sat down, he taught the crowds out of the ship.
And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon, Sail out into the deep, and slacken your nets for fishing.
And Simon having answered, said to him, Commander, wearied for the whole night, we took nothing: but at thy word I will slacken the net.
And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net broke through;
And they nodded to partners, those in the other ship, that having come they should succor them. And they came and filled both ships, so that they were sinking.
And Simon Peter fell upon his knees before Jesus, saying, Go out from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.
For amazement held him, and all those with him, at the fishing of the fishes which they took:
And likewise also James and John, Zebedee's sons, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now thou shalt be capturing men.
And having brought down the ship upon the land, having let go all things, they followed him.
And it was in his being in one of the cities, and behold a man full of leprosy: and having seen Jesus, having fallen upon the face, supplicated him, saying, Lord, if thou wouldst, thou canst cleanse me.
And having put forth the hand, he touched him, saying, I will: be thou cleansed. And the leprosy departed from him.
And he enjoined him to tell none: but having departed, show thyself to the priest, and bring near for thy cleansing as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
But the more the word passed through concerning him: and many crowds came together to hear, anti to be cured from their weaknesses.
And he was retreating into the deserts, and praying.
And it was in one of the days, and he was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting, who were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judea, and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was for healing them.
And, behold, men bringing upon a bed a man who was affected with paralysis; and they sought to bring him, and set before him.
And not finding how they might bring him in, for the crowd, having ascended upon the house, they put him down through the tiles, with the small couch, in the midst before Jesus.
And having seen their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are remitted to thee.
And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason with themselves, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can remit sins but God alone?
And Jesus having known their reflections, having answered, said to them, What do ye reason with yourselves in your hearts?
Which is easier, to say, Thy sins are remitted to thee; or to say, Arise and walk?
And that ye might know that the Son of man has power upon earth to remit sins, (he said to him affected with paralysis,) I say to thee, Arise, and having taken up thy conch, go into thy house.
And immediately having risen before them, having taken up on what he lay, he went away to his house, honouring God.
And amazement took them all, and they honoured God, and were filled with fear, saying, That we have seen wonderful things to day.
And after these, he went out, and saw a publican, by name Levi, sitting by the custom-house; and he said to him, Follow me.
And having left all, having risen, he followed him.
And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house: and there was a great crowd of publicans and others who were sitting down with them.
And the scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Wherefore eat and drink ye with publicans and sinful?
And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Those being in good health have no need of a physician; but they being ill.
I came not to call the just, but the sinful to repentance.
And they said to him, Wherefore do the disciples of John fast frequently, and make prayers, and likewise they of the Pharisees; and they to thee eat and drink.
And he said to them, Ye cannot make the sons of the nuptial chamber fast, when the bridegroom is with them.
But the days will come also, when the bridegroom shall be carried away from them; then shall they fast in those days.
And he also spake to them a parable; That none put a piece of new garment, upon an old garment; and if not so, the new also splits, and the piece from the new agrees not with the old.
And none put new wine into old wine-skins; and if not so, the new wine bursts the wine-skins, and it will be poured out, and the wine-skins will perish.
But new wine cast into new wine-skins; and both are kept.
And none drinking old, quickly desires new, for he says, The old is better.
And it was in the second first sabbath, he went through the standing corn; and his disciples pulled out the ears of corn, and ate, crumbling in small pieces with hands.
And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not lawful to do in the sabbaths.
And having answered to them, Jesus said, Have ye not read this, which David did when he hungered, and they being with him;
How he went into the house of God, and took the loaves of the setting before, and ate, and gave also to those with him; which is not lawful to eat, except for priests alone?
And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
And it was also in another sabbath, he came into the assembly, and taught: and a man was there, and his right hand was withered.
And the scribes and Pharisees observed him narrowly, if he will heal in the sabbath: that they might find accusation against him.
And he knew their reflections, and said to the man having the withered hand, Arise, and stand in the midst. And having risen, he stood.
Then said Jesus to them, I will ask you; What is lawful in the sabbath; to do good, or to do evil? to save the life, or destroy.
And having looked round upon them all, he said to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
And they were filled with want of understanding; and they discoursed with one another What they may do to Jesus.
And it was in those days, he went out to the mount to pray, and he was passing the whole night in prayer to God.
And when it was day, he called to his disciples: and having chosen twelve from them, and he named them, the sent;
Simon, (and he named him Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
Matthew and Thomas, James, him of Alpheus, and Simon called Zelotes,
Judas, of James, and Judas Iscariot, and he was the traitor.
And having come down with them, he stood upon a level place, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon, they also came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;
And those molested with unclean spirits: and they were cured.
And all the crowd sought to touch him; for there came forth power from him, and healed all.
And he having lifted up his eyes upon his disciples, said, Happy the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Happy the hungering now: for ye shall be satisfied. Happy the weeping now: for ye shall laugh.
Happy are ye, when men hate you, and when they separate you, and reproach, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.
Rejoice in that day, and skip: for, behold, your reward much in heaven: for according to these did their fathers to the prophets.
But woe to you rich for ye take away your consolation.
Woe to you having been filled for ye shall hunger. Woe to you laughing now! for ye shall grieve and weep.
Woe to you when all men speak well of you! for according to these did their fathers to the false prophets.
But I say to you hearing, Love your enemies; do good to those hating you,
Praise those cursing you, and pray for those threatening you.
To him striking thee upon the cheek hold also near the other; and from him taking away thy garments, and thou shouldest not retrench thy coat.
And to every one asking thee, do thou give; and from him taking away thy things, re-demand not.
And as ye wish that men would do to you, and do you to them likewise.
And if ye love them loving you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful would love those loving them.
And if ye do good to those doing good to you, what grace is to you? for also the sinful do the same.
And if ye lend of whom ye hope to receive back, what grace is to you? for also the sinful lend to the sinful, that they might receive back the like things.
But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing back; and your reward shall be much, and ye shall be sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the graceless and evil.
Be ye therefore compassionate, as also your Father is compassionate.
And judge not, and ye should not be judged: condemn not, and ye should not be condemned: loose ye, and ye shall be loosed.
Give, and it shall be given you; good measure, yielded, and shaken, and overflowed, shall they give into your bosom: for with the same measure that ye measure, shall it be measured back to you.
And he spake to them a parable, Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?
For the learner is not above his teacher: and every one set in order shall be as his teacher.
And why beholdest thou the dried straw in thy brother's eye, and perceivest not the beam in thine own eye?
Or how Canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, suffer that I cast out the mote in thine eye, thyself not beholding the beam in thine eye? O hypocrite, cast out first the beam from thine own eye, and then shalt thou see through to cast out the mote in thy brother's eye.
For it is not a good tree making decayed fruit; neither a decayed tree making good fruit.
For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns they gather not figs, nor of the bramble do they harvest the grape.
The good man out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forward the good thing; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forward the evil thing: for out of the abundance of the heart does his month speak.
And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say?
Every one coming to me, and hearing my words, and doing them, I will shew you to whom he is like:
He is like to a man building a house, who digged, and deepened, and set the foundation upon the rock: and there having been an overflow, the river dashed against that house, and was not able to move it: for it was founded upon the rock.
And he having heard, and not having done, is like a man having built a house upon the earth, without a foundation; against which the river dashed, and immediately it fell; and the breaking of that house was great.
And when he completed all his words in the ears of the people, he came to Capernaum.
And a certain centurion's servant being sick, was about to die; which was highly valued by him.
And having heard of Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him, that having come, he would save his servant.
And they approaching to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, That he is worthy to whom he will bestow this:
For he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.
And Jesus went with them. And now he being away not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not fit that thou shouldest come under my roof;
Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.
For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes: and to my servant, Do this, and he does.
And Jesus having heard these, wondered at him, and having turned to the crowd following him, he said, I say to you, Neither have I found so much faith in Israel.
And those sent, having turned back to the house, found the servant being sick, restored to health.
And it was in continuation he went to a city called Nain; and sufficient of his disciples went with him, and a great crowd.
And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, he dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow; and a sufficient crowd of the city was with her.
And having seen her, the Lord felt compassion for her and said to her, Weep not.
And having come, he touched the coffin, and they bearing stood. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.
And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.
And fear took all; and they praised God, saying, That a great prophet has risen up among us; and That God has reviewed his people.
And this word went out about him in all Judea, and in all the country round about.
And John's disciples announced to him of all these things.
And having called certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?
And the men, having approached to him, said, John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?
And in that same hour he cured many of diseases, and scourges, and evil spirits, and to many blind he conferred the favor to see.
And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye saw and heard; for the blind look up, the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are announced good news.
And happy is he, whoever should not be offended in me.
And the messengers of John having departed, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those in glorious clothing, and being in luxury, are in royal abodes.
But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, superior to a prophet.
This is he of whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
For I say to you, Among the begotten of women none is a greater prophet than John the Immerser; and the less in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
And all the people having heard, and the publicans, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.
And the Pharisees, and they pertaining to the law, rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not immersed by him.
And the Lord said, To whom shall I liken the men of this generation? and to whom are they like?
They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not; we lamented to you, and ye wept not.
For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.
The Son of man came eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a man, a glutton, and wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful.
And wisdom was justified of all her children.
And a certain one of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having come into the Pharisee's house, he reclined.
And, behold, a woman in the city, who was sinful, knowing that he is reclining at table in the Pharisee's house, having brought an alabaster box of perfumed oil,
And stood at his feet behind, weeping, been to wet his feet with tears, and wiped with the hairs of her head; and she kissed his feet, and anointed with the perfumed oil.
And the Pharisee having called him, seeing, said within himself, This, if he were a prophet, had known who and what race of woman which had touched him: for she is sinful.
And Jesus having answered, said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, speak.
Two debtors were to a certain money-lender: one owed five hundred drachmas, and the other fifty.
And they not having to pay, he bestowed as a gift upon both. Which of them therefore will love him the more? Say thou.
And Simon, having answered, said, I suppose, that to whom he bestowed more favor. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly,
And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: and she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
Thou gavest me no kiss: and she from when I came in left not kissing my feet.
Thou anointedst not my head with oil: and she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.
For which I say to thee, Her many sins are remitted; for she loved much: and he to whom little is remitted, loves little.
And he said to her, Thy sins are remitted.
And they reclining together began to say in themselves, Who is this who also remits sins?
And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.
And it was afterwards, and he passed through city and town proclaiming and announcing good news, the kingdom of God; and the twelve with him,
And certain women, who were cured from evil spirits and weaknesses, Mary called Magdalene, from whom went forth seven demons,
And Joanna wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who served him from possessions to them.
And a great crowd being together, and coming to him in the city, he spake by a parable:
The sower went out to sow his seed; and in his sowing, some truly fell by the way, and was trodden down, and the fowls of heaven devoured it.
And other fell upon a rock; and having brought forth, was dried up, for it had no moisture.
And other fell in the midst of thorns; and the thorns grew together and choked it.
And other fell upon good earth; and having brought forth, made fruit, a hundredfold. Saying these, he called out, He having ears to hear, let him hear.
And his disciples asked him, saying, What may this parable be?
And he said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: and to the rest in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.
And this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
And they by the way are they hearing; then comes the devil, and takes away the word from their heart, lest having believed, they should be saved.
And they upon the rock, who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; and they have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of trial fly away.
And that having fallen into thorns, and they are they having heard, and with cares and riches, and pleasures of life going forth, are choked, and bring not to maturity.
And that in the good earth, they are they which, in a fair and good heart, having heard, keep the word, and bring forth fruit with patience.
None, having lighted a light, covers it with a vessel, or puts under a bed; but sets upon a candlestick, that they entering might see the light.
For there is nothing hid, which should not be made manifest; nor concealed, which should not be made known, and come clear.
See therefore how ye hear: for whoever should have, shall be given him; and whoever should not have, and what he seems to have shall be taken away from him.
And his mother and brethren approached to him; and they could not come to him for the crowd.
And it was announced to him, saying, Thy mother and thy brethren have stood without, wishing to see thee.
And he having answered, said unto them, My mother and my brethren are they hearing the word of God, and doing it.
And it was in one of the days, and he went into a ship, and his disciples: and he said to them, Let us pass through to the other side of the lake. And they led forth.
And they sailing, he fell asleep: and a hurricane of wind came down upon the lake; and they were filled, and were in peril.
And having come near, they awoke him, saying, Ruler ruler, we perish. And having risen, he censured the wind and heaving of water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.
And he said to them, Where is your faith And having feared, they wondered, saying to one another, Who then is this! that also commands the winds and the waters, and they listen to him!
And they sailed over to the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
And he coming upon land, a certain man met him from the city, who had demons of long times, and put on no garment, and abode not in a house, but in the tombs.
And having seen Jesus and cried out, he fell before him, and with a great voice said, What to me and thee, Jesus, Son of God most high? I implore thee, thou wouldst not torment me.
For he proclaimed to the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it snatched him: and he was bound with chains, and being guarded with fetters; and bursting the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.
And Jesus asked him, saying, What is the name to thee? And he said, Legion: for many demons came into him.
And he besought him that he would not command him to go away into the abyss.
And a herd of numerous swine was there feeding on the mount: and they besought him that he would permit them to come into the swine. And he permitted them.
And the demons having come out of the man, came into the swine: and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake, and were choked.
And they feeding, having seen that done, fled, and having departed, proclaimed in the city and in the fields.
And they went out to see that done; and came to Jesus, and they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting clothed, and being of sound mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
And they, having seen, proclaimed to them how he possessed with a demon was saved.
And all the multitude of the country round about, of the Gadarenes, asked him to depart from them; for they were held fast by great fear: and he having gone into the ship, returned.
And the man from whom the demons had gone out implored him to be with him: and Jesus loosed him, saying,
Return to thy house and recount what God did to thee. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus did to him.
And it was in Jesus' returning, the crowd received him; for all were expecting him.
And, behold, a man came, to whom the name of Jairus, and he was ruler of the assembly: and having fallen before the feet of Jesus, he besought him to come to his house:
For an only daughter was to him, of about twelve years, and she was dying. And in his going the crowds pressed him.
And a woman being in a flowing of blood for twelve years, who having expended all the means of subsistence upon physicians, could not be cured by any.
Having come near behind, touched the hem of his garment: and immediately her flow of blood was stopped.
And Jesus said; Who having touched me? And all denying, Peter said, and they with him: Ruler, the crowds hold with thee and press thee, and thou sayest, Who having touched me?
And Jesus said, Somebody touched me: for I know power having gone out from me.
And the woman having seen that she was not hid, came trembling, and having fallen before him, announced to him before all people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
And he said to her. Take courage, Daughter: thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.
He yet speaking, there comes a certain of the ruler of the assembly, saying to him, That thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.
And Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be saved.
And having come into the house, he suffered not any to come in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the child.
And all wept, and bewailed her: and he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeping.
And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.
And he having cast all without, and held firmly her hand, called, saying, Child, arise.
And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he ordered to give her to eat.
And her parents were affected in mind: and he proclaimed to them, to tell no one that having been done.
And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God, and heal the sick.
And he said to them, Take away nothing for the way, neither rods, nor wallet, nor bread, nor silver; nor to have two coats apiece.
And into whatever house ye come in, remain there, and come out thence.
And as many as should not receive you, having come out of that city, and shake off the cloud of dust from your feet for testimony against them.
And having gone out, they went through the towns, proclaiming the good news, and healing every where.
And Herod the tetrarch heard all done by him: and was in perplexity, for it was said by certain, that John had been raised from the dead.
And by certain, that Elias has appeared; and by others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen.
And Herod said, John I beheaded and who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
And the sent, having returned, recounted to him what they did. And having taken them, he retreated apart in a desert place of the city, called Bethsaida.
And the crowds having known, followed him: and having received them, he spake to them, of the kingdom of God, and healed them having need of cure.
And the day began to decline: and the twelve having come near, said to him, Loose the crowd, that having departed into the towns round about and the fields, they might rest, and might find provisions; for here are we in a deserted place.
And he said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, There are no more to us than five loaves and two fishes; except having gone we buy food for all this people.
For they were about five thou sand men. And he said to his disciples, Place them reclining by fifty in a place for reposing.
And they did so, and they made all recline.
And having taken the five loaves and two fishes, having looked up to heaven, be praised them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.
And they all ate, and were satisfied: and that over and above having remained to them was taken up, twelve baskets of fragments.
And it was in his being alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom do the crowds say me to be?
And they having answered, said, John the Immerser; and others, Elias; and others, that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.
And he said to them, And whom say ye me to be? And Peter having answered said, The Christ of God.
And he having censured them, enjoined them to tell this to no one;
Saying, That the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the more ancient and the chief priests and the scribes, and be slain, and be raised up the third day.
And he said to all, If any one wish to come after me, let him deny himself, and lift up his cross daily and let him follow me.
For whoever would wish to save his soul shall lose it: and whoever should lose his soul for my sake, the same shall save it.
For what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, and having lost himself, or having been damaged?
For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he should come in the glory of himself, and of the Father, and of the holy messengers.
And I say to you truly, certain are standing here, who shall not taste of death, till they should see the kingdom of God.
And it was after these words about eight days, and having taken Peter and John and James, he went up into the mount to pray.
And it was in his praying, the look of his face was another, and his clothing white, shooting forth lightning.
And, behold, two men were speaking with him, which were Moses and Elias:
Who, having been seen in glory spake of his exit which he was about to complete in Jerusalem.
And Peter and they with him were heavy with sleep: and having waked, they saw his glory, and two men standing with him.
And it was in their having withdrawn from him, Peter said to Jesus, Ruler, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he says.
And he saying these things, there was a cloud, and it overshadowed them: and they were afraid in their going into the cloud.
And there was a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear him.
And in there having been a voice, Jesus was found alone. And they were silent, and announced nothing to any one in those days, of what they had seen.
And it was in the day following, they having come down from the mountain, there met him a great crowd.
And, behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, Teacher, I implore thee look upon my son: for he is my only born.
And, behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out; and it tears him with foam, and with difficulty withdraws from him, bruising him.
And I implored thy disciples that they cast it out; and they could not.
And Jesus having answered said, O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you, and endure you I Bring hither thy son.
And he yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tare him. And Jesus censured the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
And all were struck with amazement at the majesty of God. And all wondering at all which he did, Jesus said to his disciples,
Put ye these words into your ears: for the Son of man is about to be delivered up into the bands of men.
And they knew not this word, and it was hid from them, lest they should understand it: and they feared to ask him concerning this word.
And there came up a conference among them, thus, which of them should be the greatest.
And Jesus, having seen the reflection of their heart, having taken up a child, set it by himself,
And he said to them, Whoever should receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives him having sent me: for he being less among you all, the same shall be great.
And John having answered said, Ruler, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name; and we hindered him, because he follows not with us.
And Jesus said, Hinder him not: for who is not against us is for us.
And it was in the days of his acceptation being completed, and he fixed his face to go into Jerusalem.
And he sent messengers before his face: and having gone, they came into a town of Samaritans, in order to prepare for him.
And they received him not, for his face was going to Jerusalem.
And his disciples James and John having seen, said, O Lord, wilt thou that we should speak fire to come down from heaven, and destroy them, as also did Elias?
And having turned he censured them, and said, Ye know not of what sort of spirit ye are.
For the Son of man came not to destroy men's souls, but to save them. And they proceeded into another town:
And it was, they going in the way, a certain one said to him, I will follow thee wherever thou shouldest go forth, Lord.
And Jesus said to him, Foxes have dens, and fowls of heaven encampments; but the Son of man has not where he might lay down the head.
And he said to another, Follow me. And he said, Lord, permit me having gone, first to inter my father.
And Jesus said to him, Permit the dead to inter their own dead; and thou, having gone, announce the kingdom of God.
And another said, I will follow thee, Lord; and first permit me to take leave of those in my house.
And Jesus said to him, No one putting his hand upon the plough, and looking back, is adapted to the kingdom of God.
And after these the Lord showed forth other seventy, and sent them together two and two before his face into every city and place, where he was about to come.
Then said he to them, Truly the harvest much, and the laborers few: implore therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest.
Retire: behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Carry no purse, nor wallet, nor shoes: and greet none by the way.
And in whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace to this house.
And if truly the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: and if not so, it shall turn back to you.
And remain in the same house, eating and drinking the things of them: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.
And cure the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.
And in whatever city ye enter, and they receive you not, having gone into its spacious ways, say,
And the dust having cleaved to us from your city, we wipe off to you but know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn nigh to you.
And I say to you, that it shall be more supportable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
Woe to thee Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if in Tyre and Sidon were the powers having been in you, long since had they changed the mind, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But for Tyre and Sidon shall it be more supportable in judgment, than for you.
And thou, Capernaum, indeed even lifted up to heaven, shalt be cast down to hades.
He hearing you hears me: and he rejecting you rejects me; and he rejecting me rejects him having sent me.
And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, and the demons are subject to us in thy name.
And he said to them, I saw Satan as lightning fallen from heaven.
Behold, I give you power to tread above serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall hurt you.
But in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, that your names were written in the heavens.
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I will acknowledge to thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them to babes: yes Father, for so was it benevolence before thee.
All things were delivered me by my Father: and none knows who is the Son, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whomsoever the Son would wish to reveal.
And having turned to the disciples apart he said, Happy the eyes seeing what ye see:
For I say to you, that many prophets and kings wished to behold what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.
And, behold, a certain skilled in the law stood up, tempting him, and saying, Teacher, what having done shall I inherit eternal life?
And he said to him, What has been written in the law? how readest thou?
And he having answered, said. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart, and from thy whole soul, and from thy whole strength; and thy neighbor as thyself.
And he said to him, Thou hast answered rightly; this do and thou shalt live.
And he, wishing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
And Jesus having replied said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers: and having stripped him, and laid on blows, they departed, leaving him half dead.
And by accident a certain priest went down in that way: and having seen him, went on the opposite side.
And likewise also a Levite, having been in the place, having come and seen him, went on the opposite side.
And a certain Samaritan, traveling, came to him: and having seen him, felt compassion.
And having come near, he bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and having mounted him upon his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
And upon the morrow, he having come forth, taking out two drachmas, he gave to the inn-keeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest besides, I, in my coming back, will repay thee.
Which then of these three seems to thee to have been neighbor to him fallen among robbers?
And he said, He having done mercy with him. Then said Jesus to him. Go thou, and do likewise.
And it was in their going forth, and he came to a certain town: and a certain woman by the name of Martha received him in her house.
And also a sister was to her, called Mary; and she having sat at Jesus' feet, heard his word.
And Martha was perplexed about much service, and having stood before, said, Lord, carest thou not that my sister left me to serve alone? Speak therefore to her that she may lay hold and assist with me.
And Jesus having answered, said to her, Martha, Martha, thou hast care, and art confused about many things:
And of one thing there is need: and Mary has chosen the good part which shall not be taken away from her.
And it was in his being in a certain place praying, when he ceased, a certain of his disciples said to him Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father he in the heavens, Holy be thy name. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be, as in heaven, also upon the earth.
Give us our bread sufficient for sustenance by the day.
And remit to us our sins; for we ourselves also remit to everyone indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil.
And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and should say to him. Friend, lend me three loaves;
Since my friend has come to me from the way, and I have not what I may set before him?
And he within, having answered, should say, offer not weariness to me: already has the door been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot having risen, give thee.
I say to you, If also having risen he will not give him because of being his friend, yet for his effrontery, having risen, he will give him as many as he needs.
And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.
For every one asking, receives; and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking, it shall be opened.
And shall a son ask bread of any of you a father, will he give him a stone? And if a fish, for a fish he will not give him a serpent.
Or also if he ask an egg, he will not give him a scorpion.
If then ye, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children; how much more the Father, he from heaven, will give the Holy Spirit to them asking him?
And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it was the demon having come out, the dumb spake; and the crowds wondered.
And certain of them said. By Beelzebul ruler of demons he casts out demons.
And others, tempting, sought a sign of him from heaven.
And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is rendered desolate; and a house against a house falls.
And if Satan also be divided against himself, how should his kingdom stand? for ye say by Beelzebul I cast out demons.
And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast, out? for this shall they be your judges.
And if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God got beforehand to you.
When the strong, completely armed, should watch his court-yard, his possessions are in peace:
And when a stronger than he, having come, conquers him, he takes away his complete armor in which he trusted, and distributes his spoils.
He not being with me is against me: and he not gathering with me scatters.
When the unclean spirit comes out from a man, he passes through places wanting water, seeking rest; and not finding, he says, I will return to my house whence I came out.
And having come, he finds it swept and set in order.
Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself; and having entered, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first.
And it was in his speaking these things, a certain woman of the crowd, having lifted up the voice, said to him, in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts. Happy the womb having borne thee, and breasts thou didst suck.
And he said, Rather, happy they hearing the word of God, and watching it.
And crowds being collected, he began to say, This is an evil generation: it seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.
For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall be the Son of man to this generation.
The queen of the south shall be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, more than Solomon here.
The Ninevite men shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, more than Jonas here.
And none, having lighted a lamp, puts in secret, neither under a bushel, but upon the chandelier, that they coming in should see the light.
The light of the body is the eye; when therefore thine eye be plain, also thy whole body is clear: and when it be evil, also thy body dark.
Take heed therefore lest the light in thee be darkness.
If therefore thy whole body clear, not having any part dark, the whole shall be clear, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its gleam.
And in the speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him: and having come in he reclined.
And the Pharisee having seen, wondered that he was not first washed before dinner.
And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and trencher; and your inside is full of plunder and wickedness.
O foolish, has not he having made the outside, also made the inside?
But of the things being, give alms; and, behold, all things are clean to you.
But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe spearmint and rue and every plant, and ye pass by the judgment and love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to have left those.
Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the first seat in assemblies, and greetings in market-places.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as concealed tombs, and men walking above know not.
And a certain of the skilled in the law having answered, said, Teacher, speaking these things, and thou injurest us.
And he said, And woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye load men with loads difficult to carry, and ye yourselves touch not one of the fingers to the load.
Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Surely ye testify and assent to your fathers works: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their tombs.
And for this said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and the sent, and of them shall they kill and drive out:
That the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world be required of this generation;
From the blood of Abel even to the blood of Zacharias perishing between the altar and house: yea, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.
Woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye came not in yourselves, and those coming in ye hindered.
And he saying these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to hold on greatly, and to put questions to him of many things:
Laying wait for him, and seeking to seize something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
Upon which, myriads of the crowd having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to speak to his disciples first, Keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
And there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed; and secret which shall not be known.
Therefore whatever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in light; and what ye spake to the ear in storehouses shall be proclaimed upon house-tops.
And I say to you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these not having anything remaining to do.
And I will shew you whom ye should fear: Fear him having power, after killing, to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him.
Are not five little sparrows sold for two small coins, and one of them is not forgotten before God?
But also the hairs of your head were all numbered. Therefore fear not: ye have the preeminence over many little sparrows.
And I say to you, Every one who should acknowledge in me before men, also the Son of man will acknowledge in him before the messengers of God.
And he having denied me before men, shall he denied before the messengers of God.
And every one who shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him: and to him blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be remitted.
And when they bring you to assemblies, and beginnings, and powers, have no anxiety how or what ye allege for justification, or what ye say:
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what ye must say.
And a certain one out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
And he said to him, Man, who appointed me judge or distributer over you.
And he said to them, See, and watch yourselves from covetousness: for not in the abounding to any one of his possessions is his life.
And he spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man bore well:
And he calculated in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have not where I shall collect together my fruits?
And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my stores, and build greater; and there will I collect all my produce and my good things.
And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be gladdened.
And God said to him, O foolish one, this night they require thy soul from thee: and what thou hast prepared, to whom shall it be?
So he treasuring up for himself, and not rich toward God.
And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Have no anxiety for your soul, what ye eat; nor for the body what ye put on.
The soul is more than food, and the body than clothing.
Consider the ravens: for they sow not neither do they reap; to them there is not store-house nor store; and God nourishes them: how much more have ye preeminence of the fowls?
And which of you having anxiety can add to his size one cubit?
If then ye cannot do the least, why have ye anxiety for the rest?
Consider the white lilies, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin; and I say to you, neither was Solomon in all his glory clothed as one of these.
And if the grass, to day being in the field and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes; how much rather you, ye of little faith?
And ye, seek ye not what ye eat, or what ye drink, and keep not in anxiety.
For all these things the nations of the world seek for: and your Father knows that ye have need of these.
But seek the kingdom of God; and all these shall be added to you.
Fear not, little flock; for your Father was contented to give you the kingdom.
Sell your possessions, and give alms; make to yourselves purses not growing old, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts.
For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.
Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;
And ye like men expecting their Lord, when he shall loose from the nuptials; that having come and knocked, they might quickly open to him.
Happy those servants, whom the Lord having come shall find watching; truly I say to you, he will gird himself, and make them recline, and having come he will serve them.
And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, happy are those servants.
And know this, that if the master of the house knew what hour the thief is coming, he had watched, and not have suffered his house to be undermined.
And be ye therefore ready: for in the time which ye think not the Son of man is coming.
And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?
And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, which the Lord will set over his household, to give the allowance of wheat in due time?
Happy that servant, which his Lord, having come, shall find so doing.
Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions.
And if that servant should say in his heart, My Lord delays to come; and should begin to strike the servants and maids, also to eat and drink, and to be intoxicated;
The lord of that servant shall come in a day which he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not, and he will cut him in two equal parts, and set his portion with the unbelieving.
And that servant having known his lord's will, and not prepared, neither having done his will, shall be skinned with many.
And he not having known, and having done things worthy of blows, shall be skinned with few. And to every one to whom much was given, shall much be required of him: and with whom they have deposited much, they will ask of him the more.
I have come to cast fire into the earth; and what will I if it has been already lighted up!
And I have an immersion to be immersed with; and how am I pressed together till it should be finished!
Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? Nay, I say to you; but rather division:
For from now shall five be in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
Father shall be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And he said to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising from the descents, ye say quickly, A heavy shower of rain is coming; and it is so.
And when the south wind blowing, ye say, That there will be heat; and it is.
O hypocrites, ye know to judge the face of the earth and of heaven; and how do ye not judge this time?
And why also of yourselves judge ye not the just thing?
For when thou retirest with thine adversary to the ruler, in the way give labor to be released from him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the avenger, and the avenger cast thee into prison.
I say to thee, thou shouldest not come out thence, even till also thou shouldest give back the last small coin.
And certain were present in that time announcing to him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, Think ye that these Galileans were sinful above all the Galileans, because they have suffered such things?
No, I say to you: but except ye should change the mind, ye shall all likewise perish.
Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and killed them, think ye that these were debtors above all men dwelling in Jerusalem?
No, I say: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
And he spake this parable: A certain had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it, and found not.
And he said to the vine-dresser, Behold, three years I am come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find not: cut it off; wherefore also does it leave the earth unemployed?
And he having answered says to him, Lord, let it go also this year, till I shall dig round it, and cast dung:
Whereas also it might bear fruit: and if not, afterwards thou shalt cut it off.
And he was teaching in one of the assemblies in the sabbaths.
And, behold, there was a woman having a spirit of weakness eighteen years, and was bent together, and not able wholly to lift up the head.
And having seen her, Jesus called to, and said to her, Woman, thou hast been loosed from thy weakness.
And he put his hands on her: and immediately she was set upright, and honoured God.
And the ruler of the assembly having answered, feeling pain because Jesus cured on the sabbath, said to the crowd, Six days there are in which they ought to work; in those therefore, coming, be ye cured, and not the day of the sabbath.
Then answered the Lord and said, Hypocrite, does not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall, and leading away, give to drink?
And this being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, behold, eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond the day of the sabbath
And he saying these things, all opposed to him were ashamed: and the crowd rejoiced for all the glorious things done by him.
And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it?
It is like a kernel of mustard, which a man having taken, cast into his garden; and it grew, and became into a great tree; and the fowls of heaven encamped in its young shoots.
And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?
It is like leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, until the whole was leavened.
And he went through cities and towns, teaching, and making his passage to Jerusalem.
And a certain said to him, Lord, if few saved? And he said to them,
Strive earnestly to enter through the narrow gate: for many, I say to you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
From the time when the master of the house should rise up, and shut the door, and ye begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us: and having answered, he will say to you, I know not whence ye are:
Then will ye begin to say, We ate and drank before thee, and thou didst teach in our streets.
And he will say, I say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workmen of iniquity.
Weeping shall be there and gnashing of teeth, when ye see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you cast without.
And they shall come from the risings, and the settings, and from north, and south, and they shall recline in the kingdom of God.
And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
In the same day certain Pharisees came near, saying to him, Come out, and go from thence: for Herod wishes to kill thee.
And he said to them, Having gone, say to that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and complete cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I am completed.
But I must go to day and to morrow and the following: for it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets, and striking with stones those having been sent to her; how often I wished to gather thy children together, which manner a hen her young brood under the wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left to you a desert: and truly I say to you, That ye should not see me, until it should come when ye say, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord.
And it was in his coining into the house of a certain of the Pharisees in the sabbath to eat bread, and they were observing him narrowly.
And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before him.
And Jesus having answered, said to those skilled in the law and the Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbath?
And they were silent. And having taken, he healed, and loosed him.
And having answered, he said to them, Whose ass or ox of yours shall fall into a well, and will he not quickly pull it out on the sabbath day?
And they were not able to answer him in turn to these things.
And he spake a parable to the called, fixing his attention how they chose out the first places at table; saying to them,
When thou art called to the nuptials, thou shouldest not recline in the first place at table; lest a more honourable than thou be called by him:
And he having called thee and him, having come, shall say to thee, Give place to this; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take possession of the last place.
But when thou art called, having gone, recline in the last place; that when he having called thee come, might say to thee, Friend, mount up higher; then shall honour be to thee before them reclining with thee.
For whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be exalted.
And he also said to him having called him, When thou makest a breakfast or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy rich neighbors, nor thy brethren; lest they call thee in return, and a giving back be to thee.
But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:
And happy shalt thou be; for they have not to give back to thee: for it shall be given back to thee at the rising up of the just.
And a certain of them having reclined together, having heard these things, said to him, Happy he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and called many;
And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to the called, Come; for all things are already prepared.
And from one they all began to conciliate. The first said to him, I bought a field, and have necessity to go and see it: I ask thee, have me pardoned.
And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I ask thee, have me pardoned.
And another said, I have married wife, and therefore I cannot come.
And approaching, that servant announced to his lord these things. Then the master of the house, angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly into the streets and quarters of the city, and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.
And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is place.
And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the ways and hedges, and compel to come in, that my house may be filled up.
For I say to you, That none of those men called shall taste of my supper.
And great crowds went with him, and having turned he said to them.
If any come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, and yet also his own life, he cannot be my disciple.
And whoever lifts not his cross, and comes after me, cannot be my disciple.
For which of you, wishing to build a tower, not first, having sat down, calculates the expense, if he have things for completion?
That lest, having set the foundation, and not able to finish, all seeing begin to mock him,
Saying, That this man began to build, and was not able to finish.
Or what king, going to fight with another king in war, not, having sat down first, consults, if he be able with ten thousand to meet him coming with twenty thousand against him?
And if he, yet being far off, having sent an embassy, asks things for peace.
So then, every one of you, who renounces not all of his possessions, cannot be my disciple.
Salt good: but if salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be fitted?
Neither for the land, nor is it fitted for the dunghill; they cast it without. He having ears to hear, let him hear.
And all publicans and sinful were drawing near him to hear him.
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, That this receives the sinful, and eats together with them.
And he spake this parable to them, saying,
What man of you, having one hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, leaves not the ninety-nine in the desert, and goes for the one lost, till he find it.
And having found, he puts upon his shoulders, rejoicing.
And having come into the house, he calls together friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me: for I have found my lost sheep.
I say to you, that so shall joy be in heaven over one sinful repenting, more than over ninety-nine just, which have no need of repentance.
Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, lights not a lamp, and sweeps the house, and seeks diligently till she should find?
And having found, she calls together female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me; for I found the drachma which I lost.
So, I say to you, joy is in heaven before the messengers of God for one sinful changing the mind.
And he said, A certain man had two sons:
And the younger of them said to the father, Father, give me the portion of property falling. And he divided to them the property.
And not many days after, having gathered all things, the younger son went abroad into a far off country, and there disposed his property, living in a profligate manner.
And having spent all things, a powerful famine was in that country; and he began to be in want.
And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into the fields to feed swine.
And he eagerly desired to fill his belly with the fruits of the horntree which the swine ate: and none gave to him.
And having come to himself, he said, Many hired of my father abound in loaves, and I am perishing with hunger!
Having risen, I will go to my father, and say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,
And I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired.
And having risen, he came to his father. And yet being far off, his father saw him, and felt compassion, and having run, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
And the son said to him, Father, I sinned against heaven, and before thee, and I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
And the father said to his servants, Bring out the first robe, and clothe him; and give a ring for his hand, and shoes for the feet:
And having brought the fatted calf, sacrifice, and eating, let us be gladdened.
For this my son was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found. And they began to be gladdened.
And his elder son was in the field: and coming, as he drew near the house, he heard a concert of music, and dances.
And having called one of his servants, he inquired what these may be.
And he said to him, That thy brother has come, and thy father has sacrificed the fatted calf; because he received him in good health.
And he was angry and would not go in; then his father having come out, besought him.
And he having answered said to the father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never at any time passed by thy command: and never hast thou given me a kid, that I might be gladdened with my friends.
And when this thy son, devouring thy property with harlots, came, thou hast sacrificed for him the fattened calf.
And he said to him, Child, thou art always with me, and all mine are thine.
And to be gladdened, and to rejoice, was fitting: for this thy brother was dead, and has returned to life; and he was lost, and found.
And he said to his disciples, A certain man was rich, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as dispersing his goods.
And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear of thee give back the word of thy stewardship; for thou canst no more be steward.
And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away the stewardship from me: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.
I have resolved what I will do, that, when I should be removed from the stewardship, they might receive me in their houses.
And having called upon each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord.
And he said, An hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thou thy book, and having quickly sat down, write fifty.
Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy book, and write eighty.
And the Lord praised the steward of injustice, because he did wisely: for the sons of this life are wiser than the children of light in their generation.
And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of injustice; that, when ye fail, they might receive you into lasting tents.
He faithful in the least, is also faithful in much: and he unjust in the least, is also unjust in much.
If therefore ye were not faithful in the unjust mammon, who shall trust to you the true?
And if ye were not faithful with another, who shall give you your own?
No servant can serve two lords: for he will either hate one, and love the other; or he will hold firmly to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
And the Pharisees heard all these things, being avaricious: and they derided him.
And he said to them, Ye are they justifying yourselves before men; and God knows your hearts: for the high with men is abomination before God.
The law and the prophets until John: from then the kingdom of God announces good news, and every one is forced into it.
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one horn of the law to fall.
Every one loosing his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery: and every one marrying her having been loosed from the husband commits adultery.
A certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, being daily splendidly gladdened:
And there was a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, who was cast at his gate, having been wounded,
And eagerly desirous to be fed from crumbs falling from the rich one's table: but also the dogs, coming, licked off his wounds.
And it was, the beggar died, and was carried by messengers into Abraham's bosom: and the rich one died also, and was buried;
And in hades, having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
And he having called out, said, Father Abraham, pity me, and send Lazarus, that he might dip his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
But Abraham said, Child, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: and now here is he comforted, and thou art tormented.
And besides all these, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed: so that they wishing to pass through thence to you could not; neither could they cross over from thence to us.
And he said, Then I ask thee, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
For I have five brethren; that he might testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if some one from the dead go to them, they will change the mind.
And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither if any rise from the dead, will they be persueded.
And he said to the disciples, It is impossible there come not causes of offence: and woe, through whom they come!
It is profitable to him if the millstone of an ass were placed about his neck, and he cast into the sea, rather than he should offend one of these little ones.
Attend to yourselves: and if thy brother sin against thee, censure him; and if he should repent, let him go.
And if seven times in a day he sin against thee, and seven times in a day turn back to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt let him go.
And the sent said to the Lord, Add faith to us.
And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a kernel of mustard, said ye to this mulberry-tree, Be thou rooted up, and planted in the sea; and it had listened to you.
And which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding, who will say to him having come out of the field, Quickly having come, recline?
But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup, and, being girded, serve me, till I eat and drink; and after these, thou mayest eat and drink?
He has no favor to that servant, for he did the things appointed. I think not.
So also ye, when ye do all appointed you, say, That we are useless servants: for what we ought to do, we have done.
And it was in his going to Jerusalem, and he came through the land of Samaria and Galilee.
And he coming to a certain town, ten leprous men met him, who stood far off:
And they lifted up the voice, saying, Jesus, faster, pity us.
And having seen, he said to them, Having gone, show yourselves to the priests. And it was in their retiring they were cleansed.
And one of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a great voice honouring God.
And he fell upon the face at his feet, thanking him: and he was a Samaritan.
And Jesus having answered said, Were not ten cleansed? and where the nine?
They were not found returning to give glory to God, except this of another race.
And he said to him, Having risen, go: thy faith has saved thee.
And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:
Neither shall they say, Behold here or, behold there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
And he said to the disciples, The days come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see.
And they shall say to you, Behold here, or; behold there: go not away, nor pursue.
For as lightning, flashing out from that under heaven, shines to that under heaven; so also shall be the Son of man in his day.
And first must he suffer many things, and be disapproved of by this generation.
And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man.
They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day which Noe came into the ark, and the overflow came, and destroyed all.
And likewise as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;
And the day which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all.
According to these shall be the day in which the Son of man is revealed.
In that day, whoever shall be upon the house, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he in the fields, likewise let him not turn back behind.
Remember Lot's wife.
Whoever should seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive.
I say to you, that night shall be two upon one bed; one shall be taken, and the other let go.
Two females shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the other let go.
[Verse 36 is wanting (Missing) in most of the Greek copies.]
And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord And he said to them, Where the body, there shall the eagles be gathered together.
And he spake to them a parable, that they must always pray, and not lose courage;
Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and not occupied about man:
And a widow was in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
And he would not for a time: and after these he said in himself, And if I fear not God, and am not occupied about man;
Yet because this widow produces fatigue to me, I will avenge her, lest in the end, coming, she give me a blow under the eyes.
And the Lord said, Hear ye what the judge of injustice says.
And shall not God do the avenging of his chosen, crying to him day and night, being slow to anger toward them?
I say to you, that he will do their avenging swiftly. But the Son of man having come, shall he find faith upon earth
And he spake to certain trusting upon themselves that they were just, and setting at nought the rest, this parable:
Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
The Pharisee having stood, prayed these to himself, O God, I return thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or also as this publican.
I fast twice of the Sabbath; I pay tithes of all I possess.
And the publican, standing afar off, would not either lift up the eyes to heaven, but struck upon his breast, saying, God propitiate for me the sinful.
I say to you, this one went down to his house justified rather than that one: for every one lifting up himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be lifted up.
And they also brought babes to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples having seen, censured them.
And Jesus having called them, said, Leave the young children to come to me, and hinder them not: for of such is time kingdom of God.
Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child should not enter into it.
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?
And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good except the one God.
Thou knowest the commands, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, Thou shouldest not kill, Thou shouldest not steal, Thou shouldest not bear false testimony, Honour thy father and thy mother.
And he said, All these have I watched from my youth.
And Jesus having heard these, said to him, Yet one thing fails thee: all whatever thou hast, sell and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
And he having heard these things, was sorely grieved: for he was very rich.
And Jesus having seen him being sorely grieved, said, With how much difficulty shall they having possessions come into the kingdom of God!
For it is easier for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.
And they having heard, said, And who can be saved?
And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.
And Peter said, Behold, we have left all, and followed thee.
And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there is none who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for sake of the kingdom of God,
Who should not receive many fold in this time, and in life coming, eternal life.
And taking the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets shall be completed to the Son of man.
For he shall be delivered to the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon:
And having scourged, they shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise.
And they understood nothing of these things: and this word was hidden from them, and they discerned not the things spoken.
And it was in his drawing near to Jericho, a certain blind sat by the way, begging:
And having heard the multitude passing by, he inquired what this might be.
And they announced to him, That Jesus the Nazarite passes by.
And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, pity me.
And they going before censured him, that he be silent: and he so much the more cried out, O son of David, pity me.
And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought to him: and he having drawn near, he asked him,
Saying, What wilt thou I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I:night see again.
And Jesus said to him, See again: thy faith has saved thee.
And he immediately saw again, and followed him, honouring God: and all the people having seen, gave praise to God.
And having come in, he passed through Jericho.
And, behold, a man, called Zaccheus by name, and he was chief of the publicans, and he was rich.
And he sought to see Jesus, who he is; and he could not, from the crowd, for he was small in size.
And having run before, he went up upon an Egyptian fig tree, that he might see him: for he was about to pass through that.
And when he came to the place, having looked up, Jesus saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, having hastened, come down; for to day must I remain in thine house.
And having hasted, he came down, and received him rejoicing.
And all they having seen, murmured, saying, That he entered in to rest with a sinful man.
And Zaccheus having stood, said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have made any false accusation against any one, I give back fourfold.
And Jesus said to him, That to day salvation has been to this house, as he is also a son of Abraham.
For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.
And they hearing these things, having added, he spake a parable, for he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that immediately the kingdom of God is about to be rendered visible.
Then he said, A certain honourable man went into a country far off to take unto himself a kingdom, and to return.
And having called his ten servants, he gave them ten coins, and said to them, Attend to business, till I come.
And his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We wish not this to reign over us.
And it was in his coming back, having received the kingdom, and he spake to have these servants called to him, to whom he gave the silver, that he might know who had attended to any business.
And the first approached, saying, Lord, thy coin has gained ten coins.
And he said to him, Well, good servant: because thou west faithful in the least, be thou having power over ten cities.
And the second came saying, Lord, thy coin made five coins.
And he said to him, And be thou over five cities.
And another came saying, Lord, behold, thy coin which I have placed in a napkin:
For I feared thee, for thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and thou reapest what thou didst not sow.
And he said to him, Out of thy month will I judge thee, O evil servant. Thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I sowed not:
And wherefore gavest thou not my silver to the bankers, and I having come had received it with interest?
And to those standing by he said, Take away from him the coin, and give to him having the ten coins.
(And they said to him, Lord, he has ten coins.)
For I say to you, That to every one having shall be given; and from him not having, and what he has shall be taken away from him.
But those mine enemies, not having wished me to reign over them, bring hither, and slaughter before me.
And having said these, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
And it was as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount called of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
Having said, Retire ye to the opposite town; in which entering, ye shall find a colt bound, upon which none of men at any time have sat: having loosed, bring him.
And if any ask you, Wherefore loose ye? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of him.
And the sent, having departed, found as he said to them.
And they loosing the colt, his lords said to them, Why loose ye the colt?
And they said, The Lord has need of him.
And they brought him to Jesus: and having cast their garments upon the colt, they placed Jesus upon.
And he going, they laid down their garments in the way.
And he already drawing near to the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, began to praise God with a great voice for all the powers which they saw;
Saying, Praised the king coming in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest ones.
And certain of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, censure thy disciples.
And having answered, he said to them, I say to you, that if these should be silent, the stones shall cry out.
And as he drew near, having seen the city, he wept over it,
Saying, That if thou knewest, also thou, and also in this thy day, the things for thy peace! and now have they been hid from thine eyes.
For the days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and keep thee together from all sides,
And they shall level thee with the ground, and thy children in thee; they shall not leave in thee stone upon stone; because thou knewest not the time of thine inspection.
And having come into the temple, he began to cast out them selling and buying in it;
Saying to them, It has been written, My house is the house of prayer: and ye have made it a den of robbers.
And he was teaching in the day in the temple. And the chief priests and scribes and the first of the people sought to destroy him,
And they found not what they might do: for all the people hearing hanged on him.
And it was in one of those days, he teaching the people in the temple, and announcing good news, there came forth the chief priests, and the scribes, and the more ancient,
And they spake to him, saying, Say to us, by what authority doest thou these? or who is he having given thee this authority?
And having answered he said to them, I will ask you one word; and tell me:
Was the immersion of John of heaven, or of men.
And they reckoned up together to themselves, saying, That if we say, of heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
And if we say, of men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded John to be a prophet.
And they answered not to know from whence.
And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these.
And he began to say to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it to farmers, and went abroad sufficient time.
And in time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they give him from the fruit of the vineyard: and the farmers, skinning, sent him out empty.
And he added to send another servant: and they also having skinned and dishonoured him, sent forth empty.
And he added to send a third; and also, having wounded, they cast him out.
And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do I will send my dearly beloved son: perhaps, having seen him, they will change.
And the farmers having seen him, reasoned to themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance be ours.
And having cast him without the vineyard, they killed. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?
He shall come and destroy these farmers, and give the vineyard to others. And having heard, they said, It may not be.
And having looked upon them, he said, What then is this written, The stone which the builders disapproved of, this has been for the head of the corner?
Every one having fallen upon that stone shall be crushed, and upon whomsoever it should fall, it shall winnow him.
And the chief priests and scribes sought to lay hands upon him in the same hour; and they feared the people: for they knew he spake this parable against them.
And having observed narrowly, they sent liers-in-wait, feigning themselves to be just, that they might seize upon his word, to deliver him to the beginning and authority of the leader.
And they asked him, saying. Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and thou receivest not the face, but teachest in truth the way of God:
Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not.
And having perceived their craft, he said to them, Why tempt ye me?
Show me drachma. Whose image and inscription has it? And having answered they said, Caesar's.
And he said to them, Return therefore to Caesar, Caesar's things, and to God the things of God.
And they were not able to seize upon his word before the people: and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.
And certain of the Sadducees having approached, speaking against there being a rising up, asked him,
Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother die having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed to his brother.
Therefore were there seven brethren: and the first having taken a wife, died without children.
And the second took the wife, and he died without children.
And the third took her; and likewise also the seven: and they left no children, and died.
And after all died the woman also.
Then in the rising up, whose wife of them is she for seven had her a wife.
And Jesus having answered, said to them, The sons of this life marry, and are given in marriage.
And they having been deemed worthy to obtain that life, and the rising up of the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:
For neither can they die any more: for they are like to messengers; and are sons of God, being the sons of the rising up.
And that the dead are raised, Moses made known at the bramble, when he calls the Lord, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob.
And he is not God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.
And certain of the scribes having answered, said, Teacher, thou speakest well.
And they dared no more to ask him anything.
And he said to them, how say they Christ to be son of David?
And David himself says in the book of Psalms, the Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou from my right hand,
Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
David therefore calls him Lord, and how is be his son?
And all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,
Hold from the scribes, wishing to walk about in robes, and loving greetings in the markets, and precedencies in assemblies, and the first places at tables at suppers;
Who devour widows' houses, and for a pretence pray at great length; these shall receive more abundant judgment.
And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the royal treasury.
And he also saw a certain poor widow casting there two small coins.
And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all:
For all they, of that abounding to them, have cast in to the gifts of God: and she from her want cast in all the living which she had.
And certain speaking of the temple, that it has been arranged with beautiful stones and decorations, he said,
These which ye see, the days shall come, in which stone shall not be left upon stone, which shall not be loosened.
And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these be and what the sign when these should be about to be.
And he said, See ye, be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and the time has drawn near: therefore go not after them.
And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these must first be; but the end not immediately.
Then said he to them, Nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
And great earthquakes in places, and famines, and scourges shall be; and terrific objects and great signs shall be from heaven.
And before all these shall they cast their hands upon you, and drive out, delivering to assemblies, and prisons, being brought before kings and leaders for my name's sake.
And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.
Set therefore in your hearts, not to practise beforehand to justify yourselves:
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all they opposed to you shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.
And ye shall also be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and they shall put of you to death.
And ye shall be hated by all for my name's sake.
And there shall not a hair of your head perish.
In your patience possess ye your souls.
And when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation has drawn near.
Then let those in Judea flee to the mountain; and those in the midst of her withdraw; and let those in the countries not go into her.
For these are the days of vengeance, that all things having been written, should be completed.
And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck, in those days! for there shall be great necessity upon the land, and anger upon this people.
And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be made captives in all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by all the nations, till the times of the nations should be completed.
And signs shall be in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and commotion resounding.
Men losing breath for fear and expectation of things coming on the habitable globe: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with much power and glory.
And these things beginning to be, get out of danger, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.
And he spake to them a parable; See the fig tree, and all trees;
When they should already throw forth, seeing of yourselves ye know that summer is already near.
So also ye, when ye see these being, know that the kingdom of God is near.
Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, even till all things should be.
Heaven and earth shall pass away: and my words shall not pass away.
And attend to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be loaded with dizziness, caused by excess, and drunkenness, and cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.
For as a snare shall it come upon all remaining upon the face of all, the earth.
Watch therefore, in all time praying, that ye be deemed worthy to escape all these about to be, and to stand before the Son of man.
And the days he was teaching in the temple; and the nights, coming out, he lodged in the mount called of Olives.
And all the people arose early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.
And the festival of unleavened drew near, called the Pascha.
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
And Satan came into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and the generals, how he might deliver him to them.
And they rejoiced, and agreed to give him silver.
And he promised, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them apart from the crowd.
And the day of unleavened came, in which must be sacrificed the pascha.
And he sent Peter and John, saying, Having gone, prepare ye for us the pascha, that we might eat.
And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we should prepare?
And he said to them, Behold, you having come to the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow ye him to the house where he goes in.
And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the room where I should eat the pascha with my disciples?
And he shall shew you a great upper room spread: there prepare ye.
And having departed, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the pascha.
And when it was the hour, he reclined, and the twelve sent with him.
And he said to them, With eager desire have I desired to eat this pascha with you before I suffer:
For I say to you, no more should I eat of it, till when it should be completed in the kingdom of God.
Having taken the cup, and returned thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:
For I say to you, that I drink not of the fruit of the vine, till when the kingdom of God comes.
Having taken the bread, and returned thanks, he brake, and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you: this do ye for my remembrance.
Likewise also the cup after supping, saying, This the cup, the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you:
But, behold, the hand of him delivering me up with me at the table.
And truly the Son of man goes according to that determined: but woe to that man by whom he is delivered up!
And they began to seek together among themselves, which of them it should be that was about to do this thing.
And a love of strife was in them, which of them thinks to be the greater.
And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them; and they exercising power over them are called benefactors.
And ye not so: but let the greater with you be as the younger; and he leading, as he serving.
For which the greater, he reclining, or he serving? is not he reclining and I am in the midst of you as he serving.
And ye are they having remained with me in my temptations.
And I set to you, as my Father set to me, a kingdom;
That ye might eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and might sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you, to sift as wheat:
And I have supplicated for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou, when having turned back, confirm thy brethren.
And he said to him, Lord, with thee am I ready to go, and to prison, and to death.
And he said, I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not utter a sound this day, before thou shalt thrice deny knowing me.
And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did ye want any thing? And they said, Nothing,
Then said he to them, But now, he having a purse, let him take up, and likewise a wallet: and he not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.
For I say to you, that this written must yet be finished in me, that, Also was he reckoned with the lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.
And they said, Lord, behold, two swords here. And he said to them, It is enough.
And having come out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.
And being at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.
And he was removed from them about a stone's cast, and having placed the knees, he prayed,
Saying, Father, If thou art willing, turn aside this cup from me: but not my will, but thine, be done.
And a messenger was seen to him from heaven, strengthening him.
And being in a violent struggle, he prayed more intently: and his sweat was as clots of blood coming down upon the earth.
And having risen from prayer, having come to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief;
And he said to them, Why sleep ye? having risen, pray that ye might not enter into temptation.
And he yet speaking, Behold a crowd, and he called Judas, one of the twelve, came before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?
And they about him, having seen that, going to be, said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword.
And a certain one of them struck a servant of the chief priest, and took away his right ear.
And Jesus having answered said, Allow ye even to this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.
And Jesus said to the chief priests, and generals of the temple, and the elders, having come to him, Have ye come out, as upon a robber, with sword and sticks?
I being with you daily in the temple, ye stretched not forth the hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
And having taken, they brought him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed him far off.
And having kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they having sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.
And a certain young girl having seen him sitting by the light, and looked intently upon him, said, And this was with him.
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
And after a little another having seen him, said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
And about the space of one hour a certain other assured himself, saying, of a truth this also was with him: for he is a Galilean.
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock uttered a sound.
And the Lord having turned, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, That before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.
And Peter having come forth without wept bitterly.
And the men holding Jesus mocked him, stripping.
And having covered him, they struck his face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy who it is having struck thee.
And many other things, blaspheming, they spake against him.
And when it was day, the council of elders of the people was gathered together, and the chief priests and scribes, and they brought him to their council,
Saying, Art thou Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye would not believe:
And if I ask you, ye would not answer me, or loose me.
From now shall the Son of man be sitting from the right hand of the power of God.
And they all said, Art thou therefore the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.
And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his month.
And all the multitude of them having risen, brought him to Pilate.
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a King.
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? And he having answered, said to him, Thou sayest.
And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing blameworthy in this man.
And they were strong, saying, That he stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to here.
And Pilate having heard of Galilee, asked if the man is a Galilean.
And having known that he is from Herod's authority, he sent him to Herod, he being in Jerusalem in those days.
And Herod having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly: for he was wishing a long while since to see him, for hearing many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
And he asked him in fitting words: and he answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood zealously accusing him.
And Herod having set him at nought with his troops, and having mocked, putting about him shining clothing, sent him out to Pilate.
And also Pilate and Herod were friends in that day with one another: for they were before being in enmity with each other.
And Pilate having called together the chief priests and rulers and people,
Said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as perverting the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found nothing blameworthy in this man, of what things ye bring an accusation against him:
But neither Herod: for I sent you forth to him; and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.
Therefore, having chastised him, I will release.
(And he had necessity to loose one at the festival.)
And they cried out with the entire multitude, saying, Take this away, and loose to us Barabbas:
(Who was for a certain sedition having been in the city, and slaughter, cast into prison.)
Again Pilate called, wishing to loose Jesus.
And they exclaimed, saying, Crucify, crucify him.
And he said to them the third time, For what evil has he done I have found no cause of death in him: therefore, having corrected him, I will loose.
And they were urgent with great voices, asking for him to be crucified. And their voices and the chief priests overcame.
And Pilate sanctioned their asking to be done.
And he loosed to them him cast into prison for sedition, and slaughter, which they demanded; and delivered Jesus to their will.
And as they led him away, seizing upon Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they laid the cross upon him, to carry after Jesus.
And a great multitude of people followed him, and of women, and who were lamenting bitterly, and bewailing him.
And having turned towards them Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
For, behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and the wombs which never brought forth, and the breasts which gave not suck.
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.
For if they do these in the moist tree, what should be in the dry.
And two others who were led, evil doers, to be lifted up with him.
And when they came to the place called Kranium, there they crucified him, and the evil doers, truly one from the right, and one from the left.
And Jesus said, Father, let them go; for they know not what they do. And having divided his garments, they cast lots.
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also who with them were deriding, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.
And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar.
And saying, If thou art king of the Jews, save thyself.
And there was also an inscription written upon him, in letters Greek, Roman, and Hebrew; THIS IS KING OF THE JEWS.
And one of the evil doers hanged, blasphemed him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.
And the other having answered, censured him, saying, Shouldest thou not fear God, for thou art in the same judgment?
And truly we justly; for we receive things worthy of what we have done: and this has done nothing out of place.
And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou shouldest come into thy kingdom.
And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness was upon all the earth till the ninth hour.
And the sun was darkened, and the covering of the temple was split in the middle.
And Jesus having cried with a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands will I commit my spirit: and having said these, he expired.
And the centurion having seen that having been done, honoured God, saying, Surely this man was just.
And all the crowds having been to this viewing, seeing the things done, striking their breasts, returned.
And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women having followed him together from Galilee, seeing these.
And, behold, a man Joseph by name, being a counsellor; good and just:
(The same was not set together in the counsel and deed of them;) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
The same having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.
And having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and put it in a tomb cut in stone, where none was ever laid.
And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath shone forth.
And the women having followed, which had come to him out of Galilee, saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
And having returned, they prepared spices and perfumed oils; and truly the sabbath were they at rest according to the command.
And in one of the sabbaths, in the depth of the dawn of day, they came to the tomb, bringing spices which they had prepared, and certain with them.
And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.
And coming in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
And it was in their being perplexed for this, and, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:
And they having, been afraid, and bending the face to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living with the dead.
He is not here, but has risen: remember how he spake to you being yet in Galilee,
Saying, That the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and be raised up the third day.
And they remembered his words,
And having returned from the tomb, they announced these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
And they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the rest with them, who said these things to the sent.
And their words appeared before them as idle talk, and they believed them not.
And Peter having risen, ran to the tomb; and having stooped, saw the linen bandages lying alone, and he departed, wondering in himself at what was done.
And, behold, two of them were going in the same day to a town being about sixty stadia from Jerusalem, the name of which Emmaus.
And they were conversing with one another concerning all things having happened.
And it was in their conversing and seeking out together, and Jesus himself, having drawn near, went with them.
And their eyes were holden not to know him.
And he said to them, What words these which, walking about, ye discuss with one another, and are of gloomy aspect?
And one having answered, to whom the name Cleopas, said to him, Sojournest thou alone in Jerusalem, and knowest not the things done in it in these days?
And Jesus said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarite, who was a man, a prophet, powerful in work and words before God and all the people:
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to the judgment of death, and crucified him.
And we hoped that this is he about to redeem Israel: but also with all these things, to day it brings the third day from which these things were.
And also certain women of ours moved us out of place, having been early at the tomb;
And not finding his body, they came, saying also to have seen a vision of messengers, who say he is living.
And certain of them with us departed to the tomb, and found so as the women said: and him they saw not.
And he said to them, O ye unwise, and slow in heart to believe in all things which the prophets spake:
Must not Christ suffer these things, and enter into his glory?
And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained clearly to them in all the writings concerning himself.
And they drew near to the town where they were going: and he laid claim to go still further.
And they constrained him, saying, Remain with us: for it is near eve, and the day has declined. And he went in to remain with them.
And it was in his reclining at table with them, having taken bread, he praised, and having broken, bestowed upon them.
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he was removed from their view.
And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us, as he spake to us in the way, and as he opened the writings to us.
And having risen the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those with them.
Saying, That truly the Lord was risen, and was seen to Simon.
And they recounted the things in the way, and how he was known to them in the breaking of bread.
And they speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and he says to them, Peace to you.
And they, struck with awe and being afraid, thought to see a spirit.
And he said to them, Why have ye been troubled? and wherefore do reflections come up in your hearts?
See my hands and my feet, for I am he; feel, and see: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.
And having said this, he showed them hands and feet.
And yet they not believing from joy, and wondering, he said to them, Have ye any food here?
And they bestowed upon him part of a broiled fish, and of an honey comb.
And having taken, he ate before them.
And he said to them, These the words which I spake to you, being yet with you, for all things must be completed, written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.
Then opened he their understanding, to understand the writings,
And he said to them, That so has it been written, and so was it necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:
And repentance and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, having begun from Jerusalem.
And ye are witnesses of these things.
And, behold, I send the solemn promise of my Father upon you: and do ye sit in the city of Jerusalem, till ye be clothed with power from on high.
And he led them without, even to Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he praised them.
And it was in his praising them, he was separated from them, and carried into heaven.
And they having worshipped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
And they were always in the temple, praising and extolling God. Amen.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.
This was in the beginning with God.
All things were by him; and without him out him was not one thing that was.
In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And light shines in darkness; and darkness comprehended it not.
A man was sent from God, the name to him John.
This came for testimony, that he might testify concerning the Light, that all might believe through him.
He was not that Light, but that he might testify for the Light.
The Light was true, which enlightens every man coming into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was by him, and the world knew him not.
He came to his own things, and his own received him not.
And as many as received him, he gave them authority to be the children of God, to them believing on his name:
They were not born of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word was flesh, and dwelt with us, (and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only born of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
John testifies for him, and he tried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He coming after me was before me: for he was before me.
And of his completion we all received, and grace for grace.
For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth were by Jesus Christ.
None has seen God at any time; the only born Son, he being in the bosom of the Father, he has declared.
And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem that they might ask him, Who art thou?
And he acknowledged, and denied not; and he acknowledged, That I am not the Christ.
And they asked, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou a prophet? And he answered, No.
Then said they to him, Who art thou? that we might give answer to them having sent us. What sayest thou for thyself?
He said, I the voice of him crying in the desert, Make ye straight the way of the Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.
And they having been sent were of the Pharisees.
And they asked him, and said to him, Why immersest thou then, if thou art not Christ, neither Elias, neither a prophet?
John answered them saying, I immerse in water: but he stands the midst of you, whom ye know not;
This is he coming after me, who was before me, of whom I am not worthy that I might loose the strings of his shoes.
These things were in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was immersing.
In the morrow John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, be taking away the sin of the world.
This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who was before me: for he was before me.
And I knew him not: but that he might be manifested to Israel, for this I came immersing in water.
And John testified, saying, That I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it remained up on him.
And I knew him not: but he having sent me to immerse in water, this said to me, Upon whomsoever thou shouldest see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, this is he immersing in the Holy Spirit.
And I have seen, and testified that this is the Son of God.
Again on the morrow John stood, and two of his disciples;
And having looked upon Jesus walking, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.
And two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.
And Jesus having turned, and seen them following, says to them, What seek ye? They said to him, Rabbi, (It says, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remainest thou.
He says to them, Come and see. They came and saw where he remains, and they remained with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.
It was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, one of the two having heard of John, and followed him.
He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found Messias, which is, being interpreted, Christ.
And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus having looked upon him, said, Thou art Simon son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, interpreted, Peter.
The morrow Jesus wished to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and he says to him, Follow me.
And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
And Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus, son of Joseph, him from Nazareth.
And Nathanael said to him, Can any good be from Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and he says of him, Behold truly an Israelite, in whom is no deceit!
Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.
Nathanael answers and says to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou thou shalt see greater than these.
And he says to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, From henceforth shall ye see heaven opened, and the messengers of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
And the third day was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
And Jesus was also called, and his disciples, to the wedding.
And wine having failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.
And Jesus says to her, What to me and thee, woman mine hour comes not yet.
His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do.
And six stone water buckets were placed there, according to the purification of the Jews, containing each two or three measures.
Jesus says to them, Fill the water buckets with water. And they filled them even up over.
And he says to them, Draw now, and carry to the superintendent of the feast. And they carried.
And when the superintendent of the feast tasted the wine having been water, and knew not whence it is: (and the servants knew, having drawn the water;) the superintendent calls the bridegroom,
And says to him, Every man sets good wine first; and when they be intoxicated, then inferior: thou hast kept the good wine till now.
This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.
And the pascha of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
And found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and money-changers sitting;
And having made a scourge of ropes, he cast all out of the temple, also sheep, and oxen; and poured out the small coin of money-changers, and overturned the tables;
And he said to those selling doves, Take away these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.
And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house has eaten me up.
Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou, that thou doest these things?
Jesus answered and said to them, Loose this temple, and in three days will I raise it up.
Then said the Jews, In forty-six years was this temple built, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
But he spake concerning the temple of his body.
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them; and they believed the writing, and the word which Jesus spake.
And when he was in Jerusalem at the pascha, in the festival, many believed in his name, beholding his signs which he did.
And Jesus himself trusted not himself to them, for he knew all,
For also he had no need that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.
And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus the name to him, a ruler of the Jews:
He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God: for none can do these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.
Jesus answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except any one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born, being an old man? he cannot come in a second time to his mother's belly, and be born.
Jesus says to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, Except any one be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot come into the kingdom of God.
That born of flesh is flesh; and that born of the Spirit is spirit.
Thou shouldest not wonder that I said to thee, Ye must be born from above.
The wind, where it wills, blows, and its voice thou hearest, but thou knowest not whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one having been born of the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?
Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these?
Truly, truly, I say to thee, that what we know, we speak, and what we have seen we testify; and ye receive not our testimony.
If I spake to you earthly things, and ye believe not, how, if I speak to you heavenly things, will ye believe.
And none has ascended to heaven, except he having descended from heaven, the Son of man, he being in heaven.
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up;
That every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.
For God sent not his Son into the world that he judge the world; but that the world might be saved through him.
He believing in him is not judged: and he not believing has been already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.
And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men rather loved darkness than light, for their works were evil.
For every one doing bad things hates the light, and he comes not to the light, lest his works should be rebuked.
But he doing the truth comes to the light, that his works might be manifested, that they are wrought in God.
After these Jesus came and his disciples into the Judean land; and there he tarried with them, and immersed.
And John was also immersing in Aenon near Salim, for many waters were there: and they came near and were immersed.
For John was not yet cast into prison.
Then was there an investigation of John's disciples with Jesus about purification.
And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast testified, behold, he immerses, and all come to him.
John answered and said, No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven.
Ye yourselves testify to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
He having the bride is the bridegroom: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy for the bridegroom's voice: therefore this my joy has been completed.
He must increase, and I must be diminished.
He coming from above is above all, he being of the earth is of earth, and speaks of earth: he coming from heaven is above all.
And what he saw and heard, this be testifies: and none receives his testimony.
He having received his testimony has fixed a seal that God is true.
For he whom God sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure.
The Father loves the Son, and he has given all things into his hand.
He believing in the Son has eternal life: and he not believing the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God remains upon him.
Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John,
(Though Jesus himself immersed not, but his disciples,)
He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.
Then comes he to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place which Jacob gave to Joseph his son.
And Jacob's spring was there. Then Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat thus by the spring: it was about the sixth hour.
A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.
(For his disciples were gone into the city that they might buy food.)
Then says the Samaritan woman to him, How thou, being a Jew, askest of me to drink, being a Samaritan woman? for the Jews have no intercourse with the Samaritans.
And Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who he is saying to thee, Give me to drink: thou hadst asked him, and he had given thee living water.
The woman says to him, Lord, thou hast no vessel for drawing, and the well is deep; whence then hast thou the living water?
Thou art not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and he himself drank of it, and his sons, and his young animals.
Jesus answered and said to her, All drinking of this water shall thirst again:
But whoever should drink of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a spring of water springing up to eternal life.
The woman says to him, Lord, give me this water, that I thirst not, nor come here to draw.
Jesus says to her, Retire, call thy husband, and come here.
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou sayest well, That I have no husband:
For thou hadst five husbands; and now he whom thou hast is not thy husband: this thou saidst true.
The woman says to him, Lord, I see that thou art a prophet.
Our fathers worshipped in this mount; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where they must worship.
Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour comes, when neither in this mount, neither in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
Ye worship what ye know not: we worship what we know: for salvation is of the Jews.
But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such worshipping him.
God a Spirit: and they worshipping him must worship in spirit and truth.
The woman says to him, I know that Messias comes, called Christ: when he should come, he will announce all things to us.
Jesus says to her, I am he speaking to thee.
And upon this his disciples came, and they wondered that he spake with the woman: yet none said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?
The woman then left her water buckets and departed to the city, and says to the men,
Come, see a man, who told me all which I ever did: is not this Christ?
Then went they forth out of the city, and came to him.
And in the mean time the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
And he said to them, I have food to eat which ye know not.
Then said the disciples to one another, Has any one brought him to eat?
Jesus says to them, My food is that I might do the will of him having sent me, and finish his work.
Say ye not, That there is yet the fourth month, and harvest comes? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and behold the countries; for they are already white for harvest.
And he reaping receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life: that he sowing might rejoice together and he reaping.
For in this the word is true, That one is sowing, and another reaping.
I sent you to reap that with which ye have not been wearied: some have been wearied, and others have come into their labor.
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him for the woman's word testifying, That he told me all which I ever did.
When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them: and he remained there two days.
And many more believed on account of his word;
And they said to the woman, That we no more believe for thy speaking: for we ourselves have heard and know, that this is truly Christ, the Saviour of the world.
And after two days he came out thence, and departed to Galilee.
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.
When therefore he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all which he did in Jerusalem in the festival: for they also came to the festival.
Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.
He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.
Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.
The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.
Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.
And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.
Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.
Then the father knew that in that hour in which Jesus said to him, That thy son lives: and he believed, and his whole house.
This second sign Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.
After these was the festival of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.
In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.
For a messenger at a time went down into the pool, and troubled the water: then he having first stepped in after the troubling of the water became healthy, by whatever malady a long while since he was laid.
And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.
Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?
He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.
Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.
And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.
Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.
He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.
Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?
And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.
After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.
The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.
And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.
And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.
For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.
For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.
For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.
For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:
That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.
Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.
Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.
For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;
And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.
Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;
They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.
I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.
If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.
Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.
Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.
He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.
And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.
And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.
And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.
Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.
And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.
I receive not glory from man.
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.
How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?
Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.
For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.
And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.
And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.
And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.
And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.
Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?
And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.
Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him,
There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?
And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.
And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.
And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.
Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.
Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.
Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.
And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.
And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.
And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.
Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.
And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.
Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.
The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;
(But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)
When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?
Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.
Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.
Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?
Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.
Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?
Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.
Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.
And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.
But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.
All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.
For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.
And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.
And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.
And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph's son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?
Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.
None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.
Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.
Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.
I am the bread of life.
Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.
This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.
I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.
Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.
Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.
He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.
He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.
As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.
This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.
He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.
Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.
And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?
If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.
It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.
And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.
From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.
Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.
And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.
Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?
And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.
And Jesus walked after these in Galilee: for he wished not to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
And the festival of the Jews was near, the Pitching of tents.
Then said his brethren to him, Go away thence, and retire to Judea, that also thy disciples might see thy works which thou doest.
For none does any thing in secret, and seeks himself to be in freedom of speech. If thou do these, make thyself manifest to the world.
For neither believed his brethren in him.
Then says Jesus to them, My time is not yet present: and your time is always ready.
The world cannot hate you: but me it hates, for I testify of it, that its works are evil.
Go ye up to this festival: I go not yet up to the festival; for my time has not yet been completed.
And speaking to them these things, he remained in Galilee.
And when his brethren went up, then he went up to the festival, not openly, but as in secret.
Then the Jews sought him in the festival, and said, Where is he.
And much murmuring was for him in the crowds: some truly said, That he is good: and others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.
However none spake of him with freedom of speech, for fear of the Jews.
And now the festival being in the midst, Jesus went up to the temple, and taught.
And the Jews wondered, saying, How knows he letters, not having learned.
Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his having sent me.
If any desire to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak from myself.
He speaking from himself, seeks his own glory: but he seeking the glory of him having sent him, he is true, and no injustice is in him.
Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you does the law? Why seek ye to kill me?
The crowd answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?
Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel for this.
Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
If a man receive circumcision in the sabbath, that the law of Moses be not loosed; rage not at me, because I made a man wholly well on the Sabbath.
Judge not according to sight, but judge just judgment.
Then said some of the Jerusalemites, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
And, behold, he speaks in freedom of speech, and they say nothing to him. Not at any time knew the rulers truly, that this is truly Christ?
But we know this whence he is: and Christ, when he should come, none knows whence he is.
Then cried Jesus in the temple, teaching, and saying, And ye know me, and ye know whence I am: and I have not come of myself, but he having sent me is true, whom ye know not.
But I know him; for I am from him, and he sent me.
Then sought they to seize him: and none put the hand upon him, for his hour had not yet come.
And many of the crowd believed on him, and said, That Christ, when he should come, will he do more signs than these which he did?
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things of him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent servants that they might seize him.
Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time am I with you, and I retire to him having sent me.
And ye shall seek me and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come.
Then said the Jews among themselves, Where is he about to go, that we shall not find him? is he not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
What is the word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come?
In the last day, the great one of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
He believing in me, as said the writing, from his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.
(This spake he of the Spirit which they believing in him were about to receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; for Jesus was not yet honoured.)
Then many of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly a prophet.
Others said, This is Christ: and others said, Yet Christ comes not out of Galilee.
Said not the writing, That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was, Christ comes?
Then was there a division in the crowd on his account.
And some of them wished to seize him; but none put hands upon him.
Then came the servants to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did ye not bring him.
And the servants answered, Never spake man as this man.
Then the Pharisees answered them, Have ye not also been deceived.
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
But the crowd, not knowing the law, are cursed.
Nicodemus says to them, (he having come to him by night, being one of them,)
Our law judges not a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does.
They answered and said to him, And art thou not of Galilee? Search, and see: for a prophet has not risen out of Galilee.
And each man went to his house.
And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.
And again in the morning he was present in the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he taught them.
And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,
They say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken committing adultery, in the very act.
In the law Moses commanded us such to be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?
And this said they, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his fingers upon the earth.
And when they continued asking him, having lifted up the head, he said to them, Let him faultless among you, first cast a stone at her.
And again having stooped down, he wrote upon the earth.
And they having heard, and being convicted by consciousness, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
And Jesus having lifted up the head, and seen none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are they accusing thee? has none condemned thee.
And she said, None, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he following me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
Then said the Pharisees to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not true.
Jesus answered and said to them. Though I testify of myself; my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and where I retire; but ye know not whence I came and where I retire.
Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
And if I also judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.
And also in your law has it been written, that the testimony of two men is true.
I am he testifying of myself, and the Father having sent me testifies of me.
Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye had known my Father also.
These words spake Jesus in the royal treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one seized him; for his hour had not yet come.
Then said Jesus again to them, I retire, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I retire, ye cannot come.
Then said the Jews, Will he not kill himself? for he says, Where I retire, ye cannot come.
And he said to them, Ye are from below I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.
Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, In the beginning, he which I spake to you.
Many things have I to speak and judge of you; but he having sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him these say I to the world.
They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.
Then said Jesus to them, When ye lift up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am, and I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, these I speak.
And he having sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always things pleasing to him.
He speaking these, many believed in him.
Then said Jesus to the Jews having believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples.
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never served any; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free?
Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, say I to you, That every one doing sin, is servant of sin.
And the servant remains not in the house forever; the Son remains forever.
If the Son make you free, ye shall be truly free.
I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, for my word has no place in you.
I, what I have seen from my Father, speak: and ye, therefore, what ye have seen of your Father, do.
They answered and said to him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye had done Abraham's works.
And now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.
Ye do the works of your father. Then said they to him, We have not been born of fornication; for we have one Father, God.
Then said Jesus to them, If God were your Father, ye had loved me: for I went forth from God, and came; for I have not come of myself, but he sent me.
Wherefore ye know not my speech, for ye cannot hear my word.
Ye are of your father the devil, and the eager desires of your father will ye do. He was slaying men from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks of his own things; for he is a liar, and the father of him.
And because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me.
He being of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear not, for ye are not of God.
Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?
Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.
And I seek not my glory: there is he seeking and judging.
Truly, truly, I say to you, If any keep my word, he should never see death.
Then said the Jews to him, Now we have known that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
Thou art not greater than our father Abraham, who died; and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?
Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father honouring me; whom ye say, that he is your God:
And ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his word.
Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he might see my day: and he saw, and rejoiced.
Then said the Jews to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham.
And Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.
Then lifted up they stones that they might cast upon him: and Jesus was hid, and he went forth out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and so he passed by.
And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.
I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.
While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.
Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,
And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?
Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.
Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?
He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.
Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.
They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.
And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.
Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.
They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.
Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.
Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.
He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.
And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.
The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.
And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.
From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.
If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.
They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.
Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?
And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.
And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.
And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.
And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,
We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.
Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.
And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.
And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.
Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.
All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.
I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.
The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.
The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.
As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.
Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.
Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.
And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?
Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.
And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.
Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father's name, these testify of me.
But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
I and my Father are one.
Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.
Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.
The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?
If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;
Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.
Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,
And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.
And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.
And many believed in him there.
And a certain Lazarus was sick, from Bethany, of the town of Mary And Martha her sister.
(And Mary was she having anointed the Lord with perfumed oil, and wiped his feet with her hairs, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
Then sent the sisters to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
And Jesus having heard, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God be honoured.
And Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
When therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days.
Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
The disciples say to him, Rabbi, now the Jews sought to stone thee; and retirest thou there again?
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any walk in the day, he stumbles not, for he sees the light of this world.
But if any walk in the night, he stumbles, for light is not in him.
These things said he: and after this he says to them, Lazarus our friend has been set to sleep; but I go, that I might waken him.
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he has been set to sleep, he shall be saved.
And Jesus spake of his death: but these supposed that he speaks of the repose of sleep.
Then therefore Jesus said to them with freedom of speech, Lazarus is dead.
And I rejoice for you, that ye might believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.
Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we might die with him.
Then Jesus, having come, found him having four days already in the tomb.
And Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.
And many of the Jews were come to them about Martha and Many, that they might console them for their brother.
Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus comes, met him: and Mary sat in the house.
Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
But now I also know, that whatever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.
Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall arise.
Martha says to him, I know that he shall rise at the rising up in the last day.
Jesus said to her, I am the rising up, and life: he believing in me, though he die, shall live.
And all living and believing in me should never die. Believest thou this?
She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of God, he coming into the world.
And having said these, she departed and called Mary her sister secretly, having said, The Teacher is come, and calls thee.
She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to him.
And Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.
Then the Jews being in the house with her, and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly and went forth, followed her, saying, That she retires to the tomb, that she might weep there.
Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou wert here, my brother had not died.
Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping having come with her, was heavy in spirit, and troubled himself,
And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.
Jesus wept.
Then said the Jews, See how he loved him!
And certain of them said, Could not he having opened the eyes of the blind, have made that this should not die?
Then Jesus again being heavy in himself, comes to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was laid upon it.
Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he already smells: for it is the fourth day.
Jesus says to her, Said I not to thee, if thou shouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God.
Then took they away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above, and said, Father, I return thee thanks that thou didst hear me.
And I knew that thou always hearest me: but for the crowd standing round I said, that they might believe that thou didst send me.
And having said these, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.
And the dead came out, bound feet and hands with bandages; and his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him retire.
Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary, and seeing what Jesus did, believed in him.
But certain of them departed to the Pharisees, and said to them what Jesus did.
Then gathered together the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.
If we let him thus go, all will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away also our place and nation.
And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing,
Neither turn ye in your thoughts that it is profitable to us, that one man die for the people, and the nation perish not.
And this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;
And not for the nation alone, but that also the children of God, scattered, should be gathered into one.
Then from that day they counselled together that they might kill him.
Jesus then walked no more with freedom of speech among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.
And the Jews' pascha was near: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the pascha, that they might purify themselves.
Then sought they Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What seems it to you, that he should not come to the festival.
And also the chief priests and Pharisees had given a command, that if any know where he is, he should make known, that they might take him.
Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.
Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.
Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.
Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,
Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?
And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.
Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.
For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.
Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;
Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.
The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,
Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.
And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,
Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.
And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.
The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.
And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.
Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.
And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:
These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.
Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.
And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.
Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.
He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.
If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.
Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.
Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.
Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.
Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.
Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.
This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.
The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.
And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:
That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?
Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,
He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.
These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:
For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.
Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.
And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.
I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.
And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.
He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.
For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.
And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.
And before the feast of the pascha, Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.
And supper having been, the devil having already cast into the heart of Judas Iscariot, of Simon, that he should deliver him up;
Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things to him into the hands, and that he came out from God, and retired to God;
He arises from supper, and lays down the garments; and having taken a linen cloth, he girded himself.
Then casts he water into a washing vessel, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe with the linen cloth with which he was girded.
And he comes to Simon Peter: and he says to him, Lord, washest thou my feet?
Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these.
Peter says to him, Thou shouldest never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.
Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but the hands and head.
Jesus says to him, He washed has no need but to have the feet washed, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.
For he knew him delivering him up, therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.
When therefore he washed their feet; and took his garments, going to recline again, he said to them, Knew ye what I have done to you?
Ye call one Teacher and Lord: and ye say well; for I am.
If therefore, I washed your feet, the Lord and Teacher; ye also ought to wash the feet of one another:
For I have given you a pattern, as I have done to you, also should ye do.
Truly, truly I say to you, The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither the sent greater than he having sent him.
If ye know these, happy are ye if ye do them.
I say not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the writing might be completed, He chewing bread with me lifted up his heel against me.
From now I say to you, before it shall be, that, when it should be, ye might believe that I am.
Truly, truly, I say to you, He receiving whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he receiving me receives him having sent me.
These things Jesus having spoken, was troubled in spirit, and he testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.
Then looked the disciples one upon another, being perplexed of whom he spake.
And there was one of his disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom he loved.
Then Simon Peter nodded to this one, to inquire who it might be of whom he speaks.
And he reclining upon Jesus' breast says to him, Lord, who is it?
Jesus answers, This is he to whom I, having dipped a small morsel, shall bestow. And having dipped the small morsel, he gives to Judas Iscariot, of Simon.
And after the small morsel then came Satan into him. Then says Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.
And this none of the reclining knew for what he said to him.
For some thought, since Judas had the small coffer, that Jesus says to him, Purchase of what we have need for the festival; or, that he might give something to the poor.
He having taken the small morsel went quickly forth: and it was night when he then went forth.
Jesus says, Now was the Son of man honoured, and God was honoured in him.
If God were honoured in him, also shall God honour him in himself, and quickly shall he honour him.
Little children, yet a little am I with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, That where I retire, ye cannot come; and I say to you now.
A new command give I to you, That ye love one another: as I loved you, that ye also love one another.
In this all shall know that ye are disciples to me, if ye have love in one another.
Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where retirest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I retire, thou shalt not be able to follow me now; and afterwards thou shalt follow me.
Peter says to him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
Jesus answered, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Truly, truly, I say to thee, The cock shall not utter a sound, till thou deny me thrice.
Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and believe in me.
In my Father's house are many dwellings: and if not, I had said to you. I go to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come, and I will receive you to myself; that where I am, ye might be also.
And where I retire ye know, and the way ye know.
Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou retirest; and how can we know the way?
Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except by me.
If ye had known me, ye had also known my Father: and from now ye know, and have seen him.
Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.
Jesus says, to him, So long time am I with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip? he having seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?
Believest thou not that I in the Father, and the Father is in me? the words which I speak to you, I speak not of myself: and the Father remaining in me does the works.
Believe ye me that I in the Father, and the Father in me: and if not, for these works believe me.
Truly, truly, I say to you, He believing in me, the works which I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; for I go to my Father.
And whatever ye ask in my name, this will I do, that the Father might be honoured by the Son.
If ye ask anything in my name, I will do.
If ye love me, keep my commands.
And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Intercessor, that should remain with you forever;
The Spirit of truth; which the world cannot receive, for it sees it not, neither knows: and ye know it; for it shall remain with you, and shall be in you.
I will not leave you orphans; I come to you.
Yet a little, and the world sees me no more; and ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.
In that day shall ye know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
He having my commands, and keeping them, the same is he loving me: and he loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.
Judas says to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how has it been that thou art about to make thyself manifest to us, and not to the world?
Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our stay with him.
He not loving me will not keep my words: and the word which ye hear is not of me, but of the Father having sent me.
These have I spoken to you, remaining with you.
But the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, the same shall teach you all things, and he shall remind you of all things which I spake to you.
Peace I leave to you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be timid.
Ye have heard that I said to you, I retire, and I am coming to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.
And now have I told you before it shall be, that when it should be, ye might believe.
I will no more speak much with you: for the ruler of this world comes, and has nothing in me.
But that the world might know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Arise ye, let us go thence.
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away: and every one bearing fruit, he cleanses it, that it might bear more fruit.
Already are ye clean, through the word which I have spoken to you.
Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, if it remain not in the vine; so neither ye, if ye remain not in me.
I am the vine, ye the branches: he remaining in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.
If any remain not in me, he was cast forth as the branch, and was dried up; and they gather them together, and cast into the fire, and they are burned.
If ye remain in me, and my words remain in you, ye shall ask whatever ye wish, and it shall be to you.
In this was my Father honoured, that ye should bear much fruit: and ye shall be disciples to me.
As the Father loved me, I also loved you: remain in my love.
If ye keep my commands, ye shall remain in my love; as I have kept my Father's commands, and remain in his love.
These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be completed.
This is my command, That ye love one another, as I loved you.
Greater love than this has none, that any lay down his life for his friends.
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.
I no more call you servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: and I have called you friends; for all which I heard of my Father I made known to you.
Ye chose not me, but I chose you, and I have set you, that ye might retire and bear fruit, and your fruit remain: that whatever ye ask the Father in my name, he might give you.
These things I command you, that ye love one another.
If the world hate you, know that it has hated me the first of you.
If ye were of the world, the world had loved its own: and because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
Remember the word which I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they expelled me, they will also expel you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
But all these will they do to you for my name, for they know not him having sent me.
If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not sin and now they have no pretext for their sin.
He hating me hates my Father also.
If I did not the works in them which none other has done, they had not sin: and now have they also seen and hated also me and my Father.
But that the word written in their law might be completed, That they hated me gratuitously.
And when the Intercessor should come, which I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which comes from the Father, he shall testify of me:
And ye also testify, for ye are with me from the beginning.
These have I spoken, that ye should not be offended.
They shall make you excluded from the synagogue: but the hour comes that every one having slain you should think to bring service to God.
And these things shall they do to you, for they know not the Father, nor me.
But these have I spoken to you, that when the hour should come, ye should remember them, for I said to you. And these I said not to you from the beginning, for I was with you.
But now do I retire to him having sent me; and not one of you asks me, Where dost thou retire.
But because I have spoken these to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
But I say the truth to you; it is profitable to you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Intercessor shall not come to you; and if I go, I will send him to you.
And having come, he will convict the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment:
Truly of sin, because they believe not in me;
And of justice, because I retire to my Father, and ye see me no more;
And of judgment, for the ruler of this world has been judged.
I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.
And when he should come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he should hear, shall he speak: and he shall announce to you the things coming.
He shall honour me: for he shall take of mine, and announce to you.
All things which the Father has are mine: therefore said I, he shall take of mine, and announce to you.
A little while, and ye see me not: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, and because I retire to the Father.
Then said of his disciples to one another, What is this which he says to you, A little, and ye see me not: and again, a little, and ye shall see me: and, Because I retire to my Father?
Then said they, What is this which he says, A little we know not what he says.
Then knew Jesus that they wished to ask him, and he said to them, For this seek ye with one another that I said, A little while, and ye see me not; and again a little, and ye shall see me.
Truly, truly, I say to you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be grieved, but your grief shall be into joy.
A woman when she should bring forth, has grief, because her hour has come: and when the child should be born, she no more remembers the anguish, for the joy that a man was born into the world.
And where truly ye now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes away from you.
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, That whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
Until now ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy might be completed.
These have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the hour comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but with freedom of speech will I announce to you of the Father.
In that day shall ye ask in my name: and I say not to you that I will ask the Father for you:
For the Father himself loves you, for ye have loved me, and believed that I came forth from God.
I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
His disciples say to him, See, now thou speakest with freedom of speech, and sayest no proverb.
Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any ask thee: by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God.
Jesus answered them, Now do ye believe?
Behold, the hour comes, and has now come, that ye be scattered, each to his own, and leave me alone: and I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
These have I spoken to you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world shall ye have pressure; but take courage; I have conquered the world.
These spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; honour thy Son, that thy Son honour thee:
As thou gavest him the power of all flesh, that every one which thou hast given him, he should give to them eternal life.
And this is eternal life, that they might know thee the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.
I honoured thee upon earth: I finished the work which thou hast given me that I should do.
And now, honour thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the honour which I had with thee before the world was.
I manifested thy name to the men which thou hast given me from the world: they were to thee, and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
For the words which thou hast given me, I have given them and they received, and knew in truth that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou sentest me.
I ask for them: I ask not for the world, but for them thou hast given me: for they are to thee.
And all my things are thine, and thine mine; and I have been honoured in them.
And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. O holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou but given me, that they might be one, as we.
When I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those thou hast given me I watched, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the writing might be completed.
And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that I might have my joy completed in them.
I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, for they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
I ask not that thou take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from the evil.
They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.
Render them holy in thy truth: thy word is truth.
As thou sentest me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
And for them I render myself holy, that they also be rendered holy in the truth;
And I ask not for these alone, but also for them believing in me through their word;
That all might be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that they also be one in us; that the world might believe that thou sentest me.
And I, the honour which thou hast given me, have given them; that they might be one, as we are one.
I in them, and thou in me, that they might be perfected in one: and that the world might know that thou sentest me, and lovedst them, as thou lovedst me.
O Father, those thou hast given me, I will that where I am these also be with me: that they might behold my glory, which thou gavest me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
O just Father, the world knew thee not: but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me.
And I made known to them thy name, and I will make known: that the love with which thou lovedst me might be in them, and I in them.
Jesus having said these, went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Kedron, where was a garden, into which he came, he and his disciples.
And Judas also knew the place, he delivering him up: for Jesus was many times gathered there with his disciples.
Then Judas, having taken a band and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lights and torches and weapons.
Jesus then, knowing all coming upon him, having come out, said to them, Whom seek ye.
They answered him, Jesus the Nazarite. Jesus says to them, I am. And Judas also, he delivering up, was standing with them.
Then, when he said to them, That I am, they went away backward, and fell to the ground.
Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarite.
Jesus answered, I said to you, that I am: if then ye seek me, leave these to retire:
That the word might be completed which he spake, That whom thou hast given me, I lost none of them.
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. And the name to the servant was Malchus.
Then said Jesus to Peter, Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it.
Then the band and captain of a thousand and attendants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,
And led him away to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year.
And Caiaphas was he having counselled the Jews, that it is profitable for one man to be destroyed for the people.
And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and came together with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest.
And Peter stood before the door without. Then went out the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and spake to her guarding the door, and brought in Peter.
Then says the young girl guarding the door to Peter, Art not thou also of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.
And the servants and attendants stood, having made a heap of burning coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.
Then the chief priest asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.
Jesus answered him, I spake with freedom of speech to the world: I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews were always come together; and I spake nothing in secret.
Why askest thou me? ask those having heard, what I said to them: see, they know what I said.
And he having said these things, one of the attendants standing by gave Jesus a blow with a rod, having said, Answerest thou the chief priest so?
Jesus answered him, If I spake badly, testify of evil: and if well, why strikest thou me?
(Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.)
And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art thou not also of his disciples he denied, and said, I am not.
Says one of the chief priest's servants, being of his family whose ear Peter cut off, Saw I not thee in the garden with him?
Then Peter again denied: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: and it was early morning; and they came not into the pretorium, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the pascha.
Then went Pilate out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man.
They answered and said to him, If he were not injurious, we had not delivered him to thee.
Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. Then said the Jews to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one:
That the word of Jesus might be completed which he spake, giving a sign by what death he was about to die.
Then came Pilate again into the pretorium, and asked Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
Jesus answered him, of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee of me?
Pilate answered, Much less am I a Jew; thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: What didst thou?
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.
Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.
Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, again went he out to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault in him.
But a custom is to you, that I loose one to you in the pascha: will ye therefore I should loose to you the King of the Jews.
Then cried they all again, saying, Not this, but Barabbas: and Barabbas was a robber.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.
And the soldiers having twined a crown of thorns, put upon his head, and they put round him a purple robe,
And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him blows with a rod.
Then again went out Pilate without, and says to them, See, I lead him to you without, that ye might know that in him I find no fault.
Then went forth Jesus without, bearing a crown of thorns, and a purple garment. And he says to them, Behold the man!
When therefore the chief priests and attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify. Pilate says to them, Take ye him, and crucify; for I find no fault in him.
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, for he made himself the Son of God.
When Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid:
And went into the pretorium again, and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.
Then says Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to loose thee.
Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.
From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.
Then Pilate having heard, brought Jesus without, and sat upon the judgment seat, in a place called Paved with ornamental stones; in Hebraic, Gabbatha.
And it was the preparation of the pascha, and about the sixth hour: and he says to the Jews, Behold your King!
And they cried, Take away, take away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
Then, therefore, delivered he him to them, that he might be crucified.
And they took Jesus, and led away: and bearing his cross he went out into a place called Kranium, which in Hebraic is called Golgotha:
Where they crucified him, and with him two others, hence and thence, and Jesus in the midst.
And Pilate also wrote a title, and put upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARITE, KING OF THE JEWS.
Then read many of the Jews this title: for the place was near the city where Jesus was crucified: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Roman.
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.
Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part: and also the coat: and the coat was unsewn through the whole, having been woven from above.
Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.
And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
Then says he to the disciple, Behold thy mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own.
After this, Jesus knowing that all things were already completed, that the writing might be finished, says, I thirst.
Then was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, put upon hyssop, and brought near to his mouth.
When Jesus therefore took the vinegar, he said, It has been finished: and having bent the head, he delivered up the spirit.
Then the Jews, that the bodies remain not upon the cross in the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for great was the day of that sabbath,) asked Pilate that their legs be broken, and they be taken away.
Then came the soldiers, and truly brake the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with him.
And upon having come to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they brake not his legs:
But one of the soldiers with a javelin pricked his side, and quickly came out blood and water.
And he having seen has testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he says true, that ye might believe.
For these were that the writing be completed, A bone of him shall not be broken.
And again another writing says, They shall look on whom they goaded.
And after these, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, in secret, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might takeaway the body of Jesus: and Pilate conceded. He came then, and took the body of Jesus.
And Nicodemus also came, he having come to Jesus at first by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.
Then took they the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen bandages with spices, as the custom is to the Jews to prepare a body for interment.
And in the place where he was crucified, was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was ever laid.
There, therefore, on account of the Jews' preparation, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.
And in one of the sabbaths comes Mary Magdalene in the morning, there yet being darkness, to the tomb, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb.
Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and says to them, They took away the Lord from the tomb; and we know not where they laid him.
Peter then came forth, and the other disciple, and they came to the tomb.
And they two ran together: and the other disciple ran before, swifter than Peter, and came first to the tomb.
And having stood stooping, he sees the linen bandages lying; yet he did not go in.
Then comes Simon Peter following him, and he came into the tomb, and sees the linen bandages lying,
And the napkin, which was upon his head, not lying with the linen bandages, but separately inwrapped in one place.
Then, therefore, went in also the other disciple, having first come to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.
For not yet knew they the writing, that he must rise from the dead.
Then went away the disciples again by themselves.
And Mary stood near the tomb weeping without: therefore as she wept, she stood stooping into the tomb,
And sees two messengers in white, sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus was laid.
And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She says to them, Because they took away my Lord, and I know not where they laid him.
And having said these, she was turned back, and sees Jesus standing, and she knew not that it is Jesus.
Jesus says to her, Woman, why weepest thou a whom seekest thou? She, thinking that it is the gardener, says to him, Lord, if thou didst bear him away, say where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
Jesus says to her, Mary, She having turned, says to him, Rabboni; which is called, Teacher.
Jesus says to her, Touch me not; for I have not yet ascended to my Father: and go thou to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
Mary Magdalene comes announcing to the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and he said these to her.
Then it being evening, in that one day of the sabbaths, and the doors shut where the disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace to you.
And having said this, he showed them his hands, and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
Then said Jesus again to them, Peace to you: as the Father has sent me, I also send you.
And having said this, he inspired, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit:
Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them: whose soever ye retain, they have been retained.
And Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
Then said the other disciples to him, We have seen the Lord. And he said to them, Except I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.
And after eight days again were his disciples within, and Thomas with them: Jesus comes, the doors shut, and said, Peace to you.
Then says he to Thomas, Bring hither thy finger, and see my hands; and bring thy hand, and put into my side: and be not unbelieving, but believing.
And Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God.
Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me, Thomas, thou hast believed: happy they not having seen, and having believed.
Then truly many other signs did Jesus also before his disciples, which are not written in this small book:
But these have been written, that ye might believe that Jesus is Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life in his name.
After these things Jesus again manifested himself to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias and so he made manifest.
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and nathanael from Cana of Galilee, and they of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
Simon Peter says to them, I retire to fish. They say to him, We also go with thee. They came forth, and went up into the ship quickly; and in that night they caught nothing.
And morning being already come, Jesus stood on the sea-shore: yet the disciples knew not that it is Jesus.
Then says Jesus to them, Children, have ye nothing cooked to eat? They answered him, No.
And he said to them, Cast the net to the right parts of the ship, and ye shall find. Therefore they cast, and were no more able to draw it, from the multitude of fishes.
Then that disciple says, whom Jesus loved, to Peter, It is the Lord. Then Simon Peter having heard that it is the Lord, girded round the upper garment, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into the sea.
And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as from two hundred cubits) dragging the net of fishes.
When therefore they came away to the land, they see a heap of burning coals laid, and little fish laid upon, and bread.
Jesus says to them, Bring ye from the little fishes which ye have now caught.
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net upon the earth, full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty-three: and being so many, the net was not split.
And Jesus says to them, Come, dine. And none of the disciples dared to inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it is the Lord.
Then comes Jesus, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.
This already the third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples, having risen from the dead.
Then, when they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs.
Jesus says to him again the second time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yes, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him, Feed my sheep.
He says to him the third time, Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved that he said the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, Lord, thou knowest all; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep.
Truly, truly, I say to thee, when thou west younger, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest; and when thou shalt grow old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou wilt not.
And this he said, signifying by what death he shall honour God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me.
And Peter having turned back, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined in the supper upon his breast, and said, Lord, who is he delivering thee up.
Peter having seen him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what this.
Jesus says to him, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee? follow me.
Then went out the word to the brethren, That this disciple dies not: and Jesus said not to him, That he dies not; but, If I will him to remain till I come, what to thee?
This is the disciple testifying of these, and having written this: and we know that his testimony is true.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they be written every one, neither do I suppose the world itself will receive the books written. Amen.
Truly the first word had I made of all things, O Theophilus, of which Jesus began to do and also to teach,
Till the day having commanded the sent whom he chose through the Holy Spirit, he was taken up:
To them also he presented himself living, after he suffered, by many infallible signs, through forty days seen to them, and speaking the things of the kingdom of God:
And, being collected together, he enjoined them not to be separated from Jerusalem, but to wait for the solemn promise of the Father, which ye heard of me.
For John truly immersed in water; and ye shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not after these many days.
Truly they therefore having come together, asked him, saying, Lord, if in this time thou wilt restore the kingdom of Israel?
And he said to them, It is not yours to know the times and occasions, which the Father fixed in his own power.
But ye shall receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses to me also in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the last of the earth.
And having said these, they beholding, he was lifted up; and a cloud received him from their eyes.
And as they were looking intently to heaven, he going, behold, two men were standing before them in white raiment;
And they said, Galilean men, why stand ye looking to heaven this Jesus, taken up from you to heaven, so shall he come which manner ye saw him going to heaven.
Then returned they to Jerusalem from the mount called Olive, which is near Jerusalem, having the way of a sabbath.
And when they came in, they went up into an upper room, where were remaining also Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James of Alpheus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas of James.
All these were persevering unanimously in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary mother of Jesus, with his brethren.
And in these days Peter having risen in the midst of the disciples, said, (also the crowd of names together was about an hundred and twenty,)
Men, brethren, this writing must be filled up, which the Holy Spirit spake before by mouth of David concerning Judas, being guide to them having taken Jesus.
For he was numbered with us, and obtained the lot of this service.
Truly this therefore purchased a place from the wages of iniquity; and being bent forward, he brake in pieces in the midst, and all his entrails were poured out.
And it was known to all dwelling in Jerusalem; so that that place was called in their own dialect, Aceldama, that is, The place of blood.
For it has been written, in the book of Psalms, Let his country-house be a desert, and let none be dwelling in it: and his inspection may another take.
Therefore must there, of these men having come with us in all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and came out among us,
Having begun from the immersion of John, unto the day which he was taken up from us, be one of these a witness with you of his rising up.
And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
And having prayed, they said, Thou, O Lord, knowing hearts of all, spew forth one of two which thou hast chosen,
To take the lot of this service and sending forth, from which Judas passed by, to go to his own place.
And he gave their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was voted together with the eleven sent.
And in the day of Pentecost being completed, they were all unanimously in one and the same place.
And suddenly was a sound from heaven as of a wind moving violently, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
And seen to them were tongues divided as fire, and it sat upon each one of them.
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to utter.
And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, circumspect men, from every nation of those under heaven.
And there having been this voice, the multitude came together, and were disturbed, for each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.
And all were affected in mind and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not these speaking Galileans.
And how hear we each in our own dialect, in which we were born?
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,
And Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Lybia that near Cyrene, and Romans arriving as strangers, and Jews, and strangers,
Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.
And all were affected in mind, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What may this mean to be?
And others mocking said, That they are filled with new wine.
And Peter, having stood with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men Jews, and all ye dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hear ye my words:
For not, as ye suppose, are these intoxicated, (for it is the third hour of the day.)
But this is that spoken by the prophet Joel;
And it shall be in the last days, says God, I pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elder dream dreams:
And also upon my servants and upon my maids in those days will I pour out from my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:
And I will give wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth below; blood, and fire, and steam of smoke:
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and distinguished day of the Lord come:
And it shall be, every one, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.
Men, Israelites, bear these words; Jesus the Nazarite, a man elected by God for you by powers and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, (as also ye yourselves know:)
This one, surrendered by the fixed counsel and foreknowledge of God, having taken by lawless hands, having fastened, ye slew:
Whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death: as it was not possible for him to be holden of it.
For David says about him, I saw beforehand the Lord before me always, for he is of my right hand, that I be not moved:
For this my heart was gladdened, and my tongue was transported with joy; and yet also shall my flesh encamp in hope:
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades neither wilt thou give thy sanctified one to see corruption.
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with gladness with thy face.
Men, brethren, it is permitted to speak with freedom of speech to you of the patriarch David, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even till this day.
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him, of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit upon his throne:
Foreknowing, he spake of the rising up of Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.
This Jesus God raised up, of which all we are witnesses.
Therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which ye now see and hear.
For David ascended not into the heavens: and he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand,
Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
Therefore let all the house of Israel know certainly, that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.
And having heard, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the sent, What shall we do, men, brethren?
And Peter said to them, Repent, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all afar off, as many as the Lord our God should call.
And with many other words he appealed earnestly and besought, saying, Be ye saved from this crooked generation.
Then truly they having gladly received his word were immersed: and in that day were added about three thousand souls.
And they were persevering in the teaching of the sent, and in mutual participation, and breaking of bread, and prayers.
And to every soul was fear: and through the sent were many wonders and signs.
And all believing were in one and the same place, and had all things common:
And sold possessions and goods, and divided them to all, as any one had need.
And in the day persevering unanimously in the temple, and breaking bread in the house, they partook of food with lively joy and simplicity of heart,
Praising God, and having favor with the whole people. And in the day the Lord added the saved to the church.
And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth.
And a certain man, being lame from his mother's womb, was carried, whom they set in the day at the door of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms from those going into the temple;
Who having seen Peter and John about going into the temple asked to receive alms.
And Peter, having looked intently upon him with John, said, Look upon us.
And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something of them.
And Peter said, Silver and gold are not to me; but what I have, this I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, arise and walk.
And having taken him by the right hand, he raised: and immediately his feet and ankles were rendered firm.
And springing forth he stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and springing, and praising God.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
And they knew him, that this was he sitting for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.
And the lame healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran to them in the porch called Solomon's, much amazed.
And Peter, having seen, answered to the people, men, Israelites, why wonder ye at this? or why look ye intently at us, as by our own power or devotion having made him to walk?
The God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, God of our fathers, has honoured his child Jesus; whom ye have delivered up, and denied him before the face of Pilate, he having judged to loose.
And ye denied the Holy and Just, and demanded a man, a murderer, to be yielded to you.
And ye killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead; of whom we are witnesses.
And by faith of his name, this, whom ye see and know, his name made firm, and faith which by him, gave him this completeness before you all.
And now, brethren, I know that ye did in ignorance, as also your rulers.
But God, announced these things beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, for Christ to suffer, he so completed.
Therefore repent, and return, for your sins to be wiped out, so that times of refreshment might come from the face of the Lord;
And he send Jesus Christ, before proclaimed to you,
Whom heaven must truly receive till time of restoration of all which God spake by the mouth of all his holy prophets from forever.
For Moses truly said to the fathers, That a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you from your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear according to all whatever he speak to you.
And it shall be, whoever hears not that prophet, shall be destroyed from the people.
And all the prophets from Samuel, and those in order, as many as spake, also announced beforehand these days.
Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God set with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all families of earth be praised.
To you first God, having raised up his child Jesus, sent him praising you, in turning away each from your wickedness.
And they speaking to the people, the priests, and commander of the temple, and the Sadducees, resisted them,
Being exercised because they taught the people, and announced in Jesus the rising up from the dead.
And they put hands upon them, and set in guard for the morrow: for it was already evening.
And many of them having heard the word, believed; and the number of men was about five thousand.
And it was on the morrow, their rulers, and elders, and scribes, were gathered together at Jerusalem,
And Annas, chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the lineage of the chief priest.
And having set them in the midst, they inquired, In what power, or in what name did ye do this?
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
If we are this day examined of the kindness of the sick man, by whom he has been saved;
Be it known to all you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarite, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in this he stands before you whole.
This is the stone set at nought by you building, he having been for the head of the corner.
And salvation is in no other: for neither is another name given under heaven among men, in which we must be saved.
And seeing the freedom of speech of Peter and John, and comprehending that they are illiterate men, and private individuals, they wondered; and they knew them, that they were with Jesus.
And seeing the man healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.
And having urged them to depart out of the council, they deliberated with one another,
Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that truly a known sign has been by them, manifest to all them dwelling in Jerusalem: and we cannot deny.
But that it be not more and more exposed to the wind among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, to speak no more in this name to any man.
And having called them, they enjoined them universally not to utter neither to teach in the name of Jesus.
And Peter and John having answered to them, said, If it is just before God to hear you rather than God, judge ye.
For we cannot, the things we have seen and heard, not speak.
And they having made additional threats, loosed them, finding nothing how they might chastise them, for sake of the people: for all honoured God for that having been done.
For the man was more than forty years, upon whom this sign of healing was done.
And having been loosed, they came to their own, and announced to them what the chief priests and elders said.
And they, having heard, lifted up the voice unanimously to God, and said, Sovereign, thou God having made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all things which in them:
Having said by the mouth of David thy servant, That why were the nations insolent, and did the people practise vain things.
Kings of the earth stood up, and rulers were gathered together upon one and the same, against the Lord, and against his Christ.
For against the truth were they gathered together against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the nations and peoples of Israel,
To do what thy hands and thy counsel predestinated to be.
And now, Lord, look upon their threats: and give to thy servants, with all freedom of speech to speak thy word,
In thy stretching out thy hand for healing; and signs and wonders to be for the name of thine holy child Jesus.
And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spake the word of God with freedom of speech.
And the heart and soul of the multitude of them believing were one: and not one said any of the things being to him to be his own; but all were common to them.
And in great power the sent gave back testimony of the rising up of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.
For neither was any in want among them: for as many as were possessors of farms or houses, selling, brought the prices of things sold,
And laid down at the feet of the sent: and it was distributed to each as any had need.
And Joses, surnamed Barnabas by the sent, (which is interpreted, Son of consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian by birth,
A field being to him having sold, he brought the money and laid at the feet of the sent.
And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
And separated from the price, his wife also knowing; and having brought a certain part, laid at the feet of the sent.
And Peter said, Ananias, wherefore filled Satan thy heart, for thee to belie the Holy Spirit, and separate from the price of the farm.
Remaining, did it not remain to thee? and sold, it was in thy power: for what hast thou put this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.
And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, he expired: and great fear was upon all them hearing these things.
And the younger having risen up, drew him together, and having carried out, interred.
And there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife not knowing that done, came in.
And Peter answered to her, Tell me, if for so much ye sold the farm? And she said, Yes, for so much.
And Peter said to her, For what was it agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them having interred thy husband at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
And she fell immediately at his feet, and expired: and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried out, interred near her husband.
And great fear was upon the whole church, and upon all having heard these things.
And by the bands of the sent were many signs and wonders among the people; (and all were unanimously in Solomon's porch.
And of them remaining none dared join them: but the people magnified them.
And the believing were the more added to the Lord, multitudes of men and also of women.)
So that the sick were brought into the streets, and laid upon beds and couches, that Peter coming, even the shadow might overshadow certain of them.
And a multitude also came together of them all around the cities to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and the molested by unclean spirits: who were all healed.
And the chief priest having risen, and all they with him, (the sect being of the Sadducees,) they were filled with zeal,
And put their hands upon the sent, and set them in the public keeping.
And a messenger of the Lord by night opened the doors of the prison, and having brought them forth, said,
Go ye, and having stood, speak in the temple all the words of this life.
And having heard, they came in by morning to the temple, and taught. But the chief priest having approached, and they with him, called the council together, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.
And the attendants having come near, found them not in the prison, and having returned, they announced,
Saying, That we truly found the prison shut with all security, and the watch standing without before the doors: and having opened, we found none within.
And when the priest and captain of the temple and chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt of them, what this might be.
And a certain one having come near, announced to them, saying, That, behold, the men which ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
Then the commander having gone with attendants, brought them, not with force: for they feared the people, lest they might be stoned.
And having brought them, they set in the council: and the chief priest asked them,
Saying, Did we not announce to you by order, not to teach by this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye desire to bring upon us this man's blood.
And Peter having answered, and the sent, said, We must obey God rather than men.
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew with your own hands, having hung him upon a tree.
This, God exalted, a Chief and Saviour, with his right hand to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.
And we are his witnesses of these words; and the Holy Spirit, whom God gave to them obeying him.
And having heard, they gnashed the teeth with rage, and consulted to kill them.
And a certain Pharisee having risen up in the council, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, urged to put the sent without a little while.
And he said to them, Men, Israelites, attend to yourselves on account of these men, what ye are about to do.
For before these days Theudas arose, saying himself to be somebody: which a number of men followed, about four hundred, who was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were destroyed, and were for nothing.
After this Judas the Galilean arose in the days of enrolling, and misled enough people after him: and he perished; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.
And now say I to you, Depart from these men, and leave them; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it shall be destroyed:
And if it is of God, ye cannot destroy it; lest ye also be found contenders against God.
And by him they were persuaded: and having called the sent, having stripped, they enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus, and loosed them.
Truly therefore they went rejoicing from the face of the council, that for his name they were deemed worthy to be dishonoured.
And every day in the temple, and at the house, they ceased not teaching and announcing the good news, Jesus the Christ.
And in those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily service.
And the twelve having called the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing for us, having left the word of God, to serve tables.
Therefore, survey, brethren, seven men of you, being witnesses full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom ye shall set over this need.
And we will persevere in prayer, and the service of the word.
And the word pleased before all the multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
Whom they set before the sent: and having prayed, they put hands upon them.
And the word of God increased: and the number of disciples was multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great crowd of priests listened to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
And certain of them arose from the synagogue, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrian, and of them from Cilicia and Asia, seeking out with Stephen.
And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.
Then they put under men, saying, That we have heard him speaking defaming words against Moses, and God.
And they roused together the people, and elders, and scribes, and having stood against, they seized him, and brought to the council,
And set false witnesses, saying, This man ceases not speaking defaming words against this holy place, and the law:
For we have heard him saying; That Jesus the Nazarite shall abolish this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
And all they sitting in the council, having looked intently upon him, saw his face as the face of a messenger.
And the chief priest said, Hold these things thus?
And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye: The God of glory was sent to our father Abraham, being in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,
And he said to him, Come out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
Then having come out of the land of the Chaldeans, he dwelt in Charran: and thence, after his father died, he transplanted him into this land, in which ye now dwell.
And he gave him none inheritance in it, not a step of the foot: and he promised to give it him for a possession, and to his seed after him, there being no child to him.
And God spake thus, That his seed shall be dwelling in a strange land; and it shall subjugate them, and inflict evil four hundred years.
And the nation which they serve will I judge, said God: and after these shall they go out, and shall serve me in this place.
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so he begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
And the patriarchs having been jealous, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
And took him out of all his pressures, and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and set him leader over Egypt and his whole house.
And a famine came upon the whole land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great pressure: and our fathers found no food.
And Jacob having beard wheat being in Egypt, sent our fathers first.
And in the second time, Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's race was manifest to Pharaoh.
And Joseph having sent, called for his father Jacob, and all his kindred, in seventy-five souls.
And Jacob went down to Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
And they transported him to Sychem and put him in the tomb which Abraham was satisfied with for a price of silver from the sons of Emmor of Sychem.
And as the time of the solemn promise drew near, which God aware to Abraham, the people increased and were multiplied in Egypt.
Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
He having deceived our race by sophistry, inflicted evil upon our fathers, to make their babes cast out, that they should not breed.
In which time Moses was born, and he was shrewd to God, who was nourished up three months in his father's house:
And he having been exposed, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for a son to herself.
And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was powerful in words and in works.
And when the time of forty years was completed to him, it came up upon his heart to take a view of his brethren the sons of Israel.
And having seen a certain one injured, he defended, and did vengeance for him harassed, having struck the Egyptian,
And he supposed his brethren to understand that God by his hand gives them salvation: and they understood not.
And the following day he was seen to those contending, and he compelled them to peace, having said, Men, ye are brethren; wherefore injure ye one another?
And he injuring the neighbor repulsed him, having said, Who set thee a ruler and judge over us?
Wilt thou not kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?
And Moses fled at this word, and he was a sojourner in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
And forty years completed, a messenger of the Lord was seen to him in the desert of mount Sina, in a flame of fire in a bramble.
And Moses having seen, wondered at the sight: and he coming near to observe attentively, the voice of the Lord was to him,
I the God of thy fathers, God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. And Moses being trembling, dared not observe attentively.
And the Lord said to him, Loose the shoes of thy feet: for the place in which thou standest is holy land.
Having seen, I saw the injury of my people in Egypt, and I heard their groaning, and came down to take them away. And now came, I will send thee into Egypt.
This Moses which they denied, having said, Who set thee ruler and judge? this, God sent, a ruler and redeemer by the hand of the messenger having been seen to him in the bramble.
He brought them out, having done wonders and sign in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the desert forty years.
This is Moses, having said to the sons of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like me; him shall ye hear.
This is he having been in the church in the desert with the messenger speaking to him in Mount Sina, and our fathers: who received the living oracles to give to us:
To whom our fathers would not be obedient, but rejected, and in their hearts they turned back into Egypt,
Having said to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us: for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has been to him.
And they made a calf in those days, and brought up a sacrifice to the image, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
And God turned, and delivered them up to serve the army of heaven; as it has been written in the book of the prophets, Slain victims and sacrifices brought ye not to me forty years in the desert, O house of Israel,
And ye took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, types which ye made to worship them: and I will transplant you beyond Babylon.
The tent of testimony was with our fathers in the desert, as he speaking set to Moses, to make it according to the type which he had seen.
Which also our fathers having received brought in with Jesus in the possession of nations, which God drove out from our fathers' face, even to the days of David;
Who found grace before God, and asked to find a tent to the God of Jacob.
And Solomon built for himself a house.
But the Highest dwells not in temples made by hands; as says the prophet,
Heaven a throne to me, and earth the footstool of my feet: what house will ye build to me? says the Lord: or what the place of my rest?
Did not my hand make all these things?
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers, also you.
Which of the prophets did not your fathers drive out and they slew them announcing beforehand of the coming of the Just; of whom ye have now been traitors and murderers:
Who have received the law by the regulations of messengers, and ye watched not.
And having heard those, they were sawn through their hearts, and they gnashed the teeth upon him.
And being full of the Holy Spirit, having looked intently to heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God.
And having cried with a great voice, they held fast their ears, and rushed unanimously upon him,
And having cast out of the city, they stoned: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul.
And they stoned Stephen, calling upon, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
And having set the knees, he cried with a great voice, Lord, wouldest thou not set this sin to them. And having said this he was set to sleep.
And Saul was assenting to his murder. And in that day was a great expulsion upon the church in Jerusalem; and all were scattered up and down in the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the sent.
And circumspect men interred Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
And Saul abused the church, going into houses, and drawing out men and women, delivered to prison.
Truly therefore the dispersed passed through announcing good news the word.
And Philip having come down to the city of Samaria, proclaimed Christ to them.
And the crowds unanimously attended to things spoken by Philip, in their hearing and seeing the signs which he did.
For of many having unclean spirits, crying with a great voice, they came out: and many affected with palsy, and the lame, were healed.
And great joy was in that city.
And a certain man, Simon by name, was before in the city using magic, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be somebody great:
To whom attended from little to great, saying, This is the great power of God.
And they attended to him, because for a sufficient time they were astonished by magics.
And when they believed Philip announcing the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.
And Simon also himself believed: and having been immersed, he was persevering with Philip, beholding the signs and great powers having been, they were astonished.
And the sent in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John:
Who, having gone down, prayed for them, that they receive the Holy Spirit.
(For not yet was it fallen upon any of them: only they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)
Then put they hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
And Simon having seen that by putting on of hands of the sent the Holy Spirit is given, he brought money to them,
Saying, Give me also this power, that upon whomsoever I put hands, he might receive the Holy Spirit.
And Peter said to him, May thy silver be for ruin with thee, for thou thoughtest the gift of God to be purchased for money.
No portion is to thee, nor lot, in this word: for thy heart is not upright before God.
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart be remitted to thee.
For I see thee being in the bile of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.
And Simon having answered, said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that nothing which ye have spoken come upon me.
Truly therefore, they having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced good news to many towns of the Samaritans.
And a messenger of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go at noon in the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza, (this is desert.)
And having risen, he went: and, behold, an Ethiopian man, an eunuch of great power of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come going to worship in Jerusalem,
And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he read the prophet Esaias.
And the Spirit said to Philip, Come near, and be joined to this chariot.
And Philip running near, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and he said, Truly knowest thou what thou readest?
And he said, How can I, except somebody guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up to sit with him.
And the passage of the writing which he read was this, As a sheep for slaughter was he brought; and as a lamb before him shearing it dumb, so he opened not his mouth:
In his humiliation was his judgment taken away: and his generation who shall recount? for his life is taken from the earth.
And the eunuch having answered Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaks the prophet this of himself or of some other?
And Philip having opened his mouth, and begun from this writing, announced to him the good news, Jesus.
And as they went in the way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, Behold water; what hinders me to be immersed?
And Philip said, If thou believest from the whole heart, it is lawful. And having answered, he said, I believe the Son of God to be Jesus Christ.
And he ordered the chariot to stand: and both went down into the Water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he immersed him.
And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went his way rejoicing.
And Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he announced the good news to all of the cities, even till he came to Cesarea.
And Saul, yet breathing out threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the chief priest,
He asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he find certain men being of the way, and also women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
And in going, it was he drawing near to Damascus: and suddenly a light from heaven flashed with lightning around him:
And having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, Why drivest thou me out?
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou drivest out: hard for thee to kick against goads.
And he trembling and amazed said, Lord, What wilt thou me to do? And the Lord to him, Arise, and come into the city, and it shall be spoken to thee what thou must do.
And the men journeying with him stood astonished, hearing the voice truly, and seeing no one.
And Saul was raised up from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no one: and leading him by the hand, they brought him to Damascus.
And he was three days not seeing, and he ate not, nor drank.
And a certain disciple was in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I, Lord.
And the Lord to him, Having risen, go thou to the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas Saul by name, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays,
And he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and having put hand upon him, so that he might look up and see again.
And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evils he did to thy holy ones in Jerusalem:
And here has he authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.
And the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a vessel of choice to me, to lift up my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel:
For I will show him what he must suffer for my name.
And Ananias departed, and came into the house; and having put hands upon him said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus, he seen to thee in the way which thou earnest, so that thou mightest look up, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
And quickly there fell from his eyes as scales: and he immediately looked up, and having risen, he was immersed.
And having taken food, he was strong. And Saul was in Damascus with the disciples certain days.
And quickly in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
And all they hearing were affected in mind, and said: Is not this he having laid waste in Jerusalem those calling upon this name, and he has come here for this, that he might bring them having been bound to the chief priests?
And Saul was the more strengthened, and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, demonstrating that this is the Christ.
And when sufficient days were completed, the Jews counselled together to put him to death:
But this project was known to Saul. And they observed narrowly the gates day, and also night, that they might kill him.
And the disciples having taken him by night, put through the wall, having let down in a wicker basket.
And Saul being present in Jerusalem, tried to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.
And Barnabas having taken him, brought him to the sent, and recounted to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he spake freely in the name of Jesus.
And he was with them going in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking freely in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And he spake and sought out with the Greeks; but they purposed to kill him.
And the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea, and they sent him forth to Tarsus.
Then truly the churches through the Whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, being built up; and going in the fear of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.
And it was Peter, passing through all, came down also to the holy ones dwelling in Lydda.
And he found there a certain man, Eneas by name, lying upon a bed of eight years, who was affected with palsy.
And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee; arise, and cover thyself. And he arose quickly.
And all dwelling in Lydda and Saron saw him, who turned back to the Lord.
And in Joppa was a certain disciple by name Tabitha, which interpreted is called Dorcas: she was full of good works and alms which she did.
And it was in those days, having been sick, she died; and having washed, they laid her in an upper room.
And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in it, sent to him two men, beseeching not to hesitate to pass through even to them.
And Peter having risen came with them. Whom having approached, they brought into the upper room: and all the widows stood before him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, being with them.
And Peter having put them all without, having set the knees, prayed; and having turned back to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and having seen Peter, sat up.
And having given her the hand, he raised her up, and having called the holy ones and the widows, he placed her living before them.
And it was known through the whole of Joppa: and many believed upon the Lord.
And days sufficient he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a currier.
And a certain man was in Cesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italian,
Religious, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying God always.
He saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day a messenger of God having come in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.
And having looked at him intently, and being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms went up for remembrance before God.
And now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, who is called Peter:
He is received as guest with a certain Simon a currier, to whom is a house by the sea: he shall speak to thee what thou must do.
And when the messenger speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his servants, and a religious soldier of those persevering with him;
And having related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.
And the morrow, these traveling, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray about the sixth hour:
And he was hungry, and would have eaten: and these making ready, a deep trance fell upon him,
And he sees heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as a great linen napkin fastened at the four beginnings, and laid down upon the earth:
In which were all the quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.
And a voice was to him, Having risen, Peter, kill, and eat.
And Peter said, By no means, Lord; for never ate I anything common or unclean.
And a voice again of a second time to him, What things God cleansed, do not thou make common.
And this was for thrice: and again was the vessel taken up into heaven.
And as Peter was doubting in himself what the vision might be which he saw, and behold, the man sent from Cornelius having asked for Simon's house, stood at the gate,
And having called, they were inquiring if Simon, surnamed Peter, is received there as a guest.
And Peter reflecting concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.
But thou having risen, come down, and go with them, discussing nothing; for I have sent them.
And Peter having come down to the men sent from Cornelius to him, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what the cause for which ye are present?
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and witnessed of by the whole nation of the Jews, received intimation of the divine will by a holy messenger to send for thee to his house, and hear words of thee.
Therefore having called them in, he received as guests. And on the morrow Peter came forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa came with him.
And the morrow he came to Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and friends by relationship.
And it was as Peter came in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at his feet, worshipped.
And Peter raised him up, saying, Arise: I am also myself man.
And discoursing with him, he came in, and finds many come together.
And he said to them, Ye know that it is violating law for a man a Jew to join himself, or come near to a strange tribe: and God shewed me to call no man common or unclean.
And therefore came I without contradiction, having been sent for; therefore I inquire for what word ye sent for me?
And Cornelius said, From the fourth day till this hour I was fasting; and the ninth hour praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was harkened to, and thine alms remembered before God.
Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he is received as guest in the house of Simon the currier by the sea: who, being present, shall speak to thee.
From this therefore sent I to thee: and thou didst well being present. Now therefore are all we present before God, to hear all commanded thee of God.
And Peter having opened the month; said, of a truth I comprehend that God is no respecter of faces!
But in every nation he fearing him, and working justice, is acceptable to him.
The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, announcing good news, peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.)
The word ye know, having been through the whole of Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached;
Jesus from Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power; who passed through doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.
And ye are witnesses of all which he did in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they killed, having hanged upon wood:
Him God raised the third day, and gave him to be manifest;
Not to all people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.
And he enjoined us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that this is he appointed by God, Judge of the living and the dead.
To him all the prophets testify, for all believing on him to receive remission of sins through his name.
Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all hearing the word.
And believers of the circumcision were affected in mind, as many as came with Peter, that also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.
For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter,
Much less can any hinder water, for these not to be immersed, who received the Holy Spirit as also we?
And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then asked they him to remain certain days.
And the apostles and brethren, those being in Judea, heard that the nations also received the word of God.
And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision discussed with him,
Saying, That thou camest in to men having uncircumcision, and didst eat With them.
And Peter having begun, set forth to them in order, saying,
I was in the city Joppa, praying: and in a deep trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descending as a great linen napkin, let down from heaven by four beginnings; and it came even to me:
Upon which having looked intently, I observed, and saw quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.
And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.
And I said, By no means, Lord: for anything common or unclean never came into my month.
And a voice answered me of a second time from heaven, What God cleansed, profane not.
And this was for thrice: and again all was drawn up into heaven.
And, behold, from this three men stood at the house in which I was, sent from Cesarea to me.
And the spirit said to me to come with them, discussing nothing. And these six brethren came also with me, and we came to the man's house:
And he announced to us how he saw a messenger in his house, having stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, surnamed Peter.
Who shall speak words to thee, by which thou shalt be saved and all thy house.
And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as also upon us in the beginning.
And I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John truly immersed with water; but ye shall be immersed with the Holy Spirit.
If therefore God gave the like gift to them as also to us, having believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; how was I able to hinder God.
And having heard these, they were silent, and honoured God, saying, For also God gave the nations repentance to life.
Therefore truly those dispersed by the pressure having been on account of Stephen, passed through even to Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except the Jews only.
And certain of them were Cyprian and Cyrenian men, who having come to Antioch, spake to the Greeks announcing good news, the Lord Jesus.
And the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number having believed, turned to the Lord.
And the word was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem concerning them: and they sent Barnabas to pass through even to Antioch.
Who, having been present, and seen the grace of God, rejoiced, and besought them all, with purpose of heart, to remain to the Lord.
For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a crowd sufficient were added to the Lord.
And Barnabas came forth to Tarsus, to seek Saul.
And having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it was for a whole year they were assembled together in the churches, and taught a sufficient crowd. And the disciples were Christians by divine intimation first in Antioch.
In these days came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.
And one of them having risen, Agabus by name, signified by the Holy Spirit a great famine was about to be upon the whole habitable globe: which was during Claudius Caesar.
And certain of the disciples, as he was able, determined, each of them, to send for service to the brethren dwelling in Judea:
Which also they did, having sent to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
And at that time Herod the king laid hands upon to injure certain of the church.
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
And having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added also to take Peter. (They were the days of unleavened bread.)
And having seized, he put him in prison, having delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to watch him; wishing after the pascha to bring him to the people.
Truly therefore was Peter kept in prison: and prayer was made continually by the church to God for him.
And when Herod was about to bring him before, in that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the watch before the door kept the prison.
And, behold, the messenger of the Lord stood before, and a light shone in the dwelling: and having struck Peter's side, he raised him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from the hands.
And the messenger said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy small sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Put round thy garment, and follow me.
And having come out, he followed him; and knew not that it is true that being done by the messenger; and seemed to see a vision.
And having passed by the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate leading to the city; which of its free will was opened to them: and having come out, they advanced one street; and quickly the messenger departed from him.
And Peter being as himself, said, Now know I truly that the Lord sent his messenger, and took me out of the hands of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
And being conscious, he came to the house of Mary mother of John, surnamed Mark; where were sufficient assembled, and praying.
And Peter having knocked at the door of the gate, a young girl came near to listen, by name Rhoda.
And having known Peter's voice, from joy she opened not the gate, and running, announced Peter to stand before the gate.
And they said to her, Thou art mad. And she was strengthened to have it so. And they said, It is his messenger.
And Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw him, and were moved.
And having shaken with the hand at them to be silent, he related to them how the Lord brought him out of prison. And he said, Announce these things to James, and the brethren. And having come out, he went to another place.
And it being day, not a little trouble was among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.
And Herod having sought him, and not found, having examined the watch, commanded them to be removed. And having come down from Judea to Cesarea, he tarried.
And Herod was fighting with violent animosity, with Tyrians and Sidonians: but they came unanimously to him, and having conciliated Blastus, him over the king's bed-chamber, they asked peace; for their country was nourished from the king's.
And upon a fixed day, Herod, having put on royal apparel, and having sat upon the judgment seat, harangued them.
And the people called aloud, The voice of God, and not of man.
And immediately the messenger of the Lord struck him, because he gave not the glory to God: and eaten by worms, he expired.
And the word of God increased and multiplied.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having completed the service, and taken with them John, surnamed Mark.
And certain prophets and teachers were in the church being in Antioch; as Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
And they serving the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me Barnabas and Saul to the work which I have called them.
Then having fasted and prayed, and put hands upon them, they let go.
Therefore these truly, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, came down to Seleucia and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John a servant.
And having passed through the island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew, the name to him Barjesus:
Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paul, an intelligent man; he having called Barnabas and Saul, sought anxiously to hear the word of God.
And Elymas the magician withstood them, (for so was his name interpreted,) seeking to turn the proconsul from the faith.
And Saul, (also Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, and looking intently upon him, said,
O, full of deceit, and all dexterity, son of the devil, enemy of all justice, Wilt thou cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun till the time. And immediately fell upon him mist and darkness; and going about he sought leading by hand.
Then the proconsul having seen that done, he believed, being struck with amazement at the teaching of the Lord.
And having been brought from Paphos, they about Paul came to Perga of Pamphylia: and John, having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.
And they having passed from Perga, approached Antioch of Pisidia, and having come into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.
And after reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brethren, if the word of encouragement is in you to the people, speak.
And Paul having risen, and shaken with the hand, said, Men, Israelites, and ye fearing God, hear ye.
God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people in sojourning the land of Egypt, and with high arm brought them out of it.
And about forty years time he bare them in the desert.
And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he gave them to inherit this land by lot.
And after these, about four hundred and fifty years he gave judges, even to Samuel the prophet.
And thence they desired a king; and God gave them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.
And having removed him, he raised up to them David for king; to whom also having testified, he said, I found David of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who shall do all my desires.
From the seed of this has God according to promise raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:
John having proclaimed before the face of his coming the immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.
And as John completed the course, be said, Whom think ye me to be? I am not. But, behold, he comes after me, whose shoes of the feet I am not worthy to loose.
Men, brethren, sons of Abraham's race, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent.
For they dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known him, and the voices of the prophets which being read in every sabbath, having judged, they filled up.
And having found no cause of death, they desired Pilate to have him slain.
And when they finished all things written concerning him, having taken down from the wood, they put in a tomb.
And God raised him from the dead:
Who was seen for many days to them having come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
And we announce good news to you, the promise made to our fathers,
For this has God completed to us, their children, having raised up Jesus; as it has also been written in the second Psalms, Thou art my Son; to day have I begotten thee.
And that he raised him from the dead, no more about to return to corruption, so he said, That I will give you the holy, faithful things of David.
For also in another, he says, Thou shalt not give thy Holy one to see corruption.
For David, truly having served his own generation by the will of God, was set to sleep, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption:
But whom God raised up, he saw no corruption.
Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that for him remission of sins is announced to you.
And from all which ye could not be justified by Moses' law, every one believing in him is justified.
See ye, therefore, that that spoken by the prophets come not upon you.
See, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, which ye would not believe if any recount to you.
And the Jews having gone out of the synagogue, the nations besought to have these words spoken in the sabbath between.
And the synagogue having been dissolved, many of the Jews and strangers worshipping, followed Paul and Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to remain in the grace of God.
And the next sabbath nearly all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God.
And the Jews, having seen the crowds, were filled with envy, and spake against the things said by Paul, contradicting and defaming.
And Paul and Barnabas speaking freely, said, To you was it first necessary for the word of God to be spoken: but since ye reject it, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the nations.
For so has the Lord commanded us, I have set thee for a light of the nations, for thee to be for salvation even to the last of the earth.
And the nations having rejoiced, honoured the word of the Lord: and they believed, as many as were drawn out for eternal life.
And the word of the Lord was conveyed through the whole country.
And the Jews urged on the worshipping and distinguished women, and the first men of the city, and they raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and they cast them out of their bounds,
And they, having shaken off the cloud of the dust of their feet against them, came into Iconium.
And the disciples were filled with joy, and the Holy Spirit.
And it was in Iconium according to the same, went they into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude of the Jews and also of Greeks believed.
And the unbelieving Jews excited and trained up the souls of the nations against the brethren.
Therefore truly they remained a sufficient time speaking freely in the Lord, he testifying to the word of his grace, and giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
And the multitude of the city was divided: and some truly were with the Jews, and some with the sent.
And when there was a violent effort of the nations, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to be insolent, and to stone them,
Being conscious, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the country round about:
And there they were announcing the good news.
And a certain man in Lystra, not having strength in the feet, sat, being lame from his mother's belly, who had never walked:
He having heard Paul speaking, who having looked intently upon him, and seen that he has faith to be cured,
Said with a great voice, Stand up upon thy feet upright: And he leaped and walked.
And the crowds having seen what Paul did, lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, Gods likened to men came down to us.
And truly they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, since he was leader of the word.
And Jupiter's priest, being before their city, having brought bulls and crowns to the gates, wished to sacrifice with the crowd.
And Barnabas and Paul, the sent, having heard, having rent their garments, rushed in among the crowd, crying out,
And saying, Men, why do ye these things? We also are men of similar passions with you, announcing good news to turn you back from these vanities to the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and sea, and all in them:
Who in past generations suffered all nations to go in their ways.
And surely indeed he left not himself without witness, doing good, having given us rain from heaven, and fruitful times, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
And saying these, they scarcely hindered the crowds, not to sacrifice to them.
And Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, and stoned Paul, drew out of the city, supposing him to be dead.
And the disciples having surrounded him, having risen, he came into the city: and the morrow he came out with Barnabas to Derbe.
And having announced that city the good news, and made disciples sufficient, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,
And supporting the souls of the disciples, beseeching to remain in the faith, that through many pressures we must come into the kingdom of God.
And having chosen them elders in the church, having prayed with fasting, they set them before the Lord, in whom they had believed.
And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
And having spoken the word in Perga, they came down to Attalia:
And thence they sailed away to Antioch, thence were they delivered by the grace of God to the work which they completed.
And having arrived, and gathered the church together, they announced what God did with them, and that he opened the door of faith to the nations.
And they tarried there not a little time with the disciples.
And certain having come down from Judea taught the brethren, That except ye be circumcised by Moses custom, ye cannot be saved.
Therefore dissension and no small discussion having been to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas to go up, and certain others of them, to the sent and elders in Jerusalem about this question.
Truly therefore the sent by the church passed through Phenice and Samaria, relating the turning back of the nations: and they made great joy to all the brethren.
And having arrived at Jerusalem they were received by the church, and the sent and elders, and they announced what God did with them.
And certain of them from the sect of the Pharisees having believed, rose up, saying, That they must be circumcised, and to enjoin to keep the law of Moses.
And the sent and elders were gathered together to see about this word.
And much discussion having been, Peter having risen up, said to them, Men, brethren, ye know that from ancient days God chose among us, through my month for the nations to hear the word of good news, and believe.
And God the knower of hearts testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, as also us;
And separated nothing between us and also them, by faith having purified their hearts.
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
But by grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be saved, as also they.
And all the multitude were silent, and heard Barnabas and Paul, recounting what signs and wonders God did in the nations through them.
And after they were silent, James answered, saying, Men, brethren, hear me:
Simeon related how God first reviewed to take from the nations a people for his name.
And with this the words of the prophets agree: as has been written,
After these will I return, and rebuild the tent of David, having fallen; and its things undermined will I rebuild, and set it upright:
So that they remaining of men might seek out the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name has been called upon them, says the Lord, making all these.
Known to God are all his works from eternity.
Wherefore I judge, not to molest them, from the nations turning back to God:
But to send to them, to keep off from pollutions of images, and harlotry, and strangulation, and blood.
For Moses of ancient generations has them proclaiming him in every city, being read in the synagogues in every sabbath.
Then it seemed fitting to the sent and the elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren:
Having written by their hand thus; The sent and elders and brethren to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia from the nations, health:
Since we heard that certain of us having come out have troubled you with words, destroying your souls, saying, To be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we sent no word:
It seemed fitting to us, having been unanimous, to send to you chosen men with our dearly beloved Barnabas and Paul,
Men having delivered up their souls for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore have we sent Judas and Silas, and these by the word announcing these things.
For it seemed fitting to the Holy Spirit, and to us, for no more burden to be put upon you but the necessities of these;
To keep off from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and strangulation, and harlotry: from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
Truly therefore having been loosed, they came to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they gave up the epistle:
And having read, they rejoiced for the encouraging.
And Judas and Silas, they also being prophets, through much speech consoled the brethren, and supported.
And having made time, they were loosed with peace from the brethren to the sent.
And it seemed fitting to Silas to wait for him.
And Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and announcing good news, with many others, the word of the Lord.
And after certain days said Paul to Barnabas, Now having turned back, let us review our brethren in every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, how they hold.
And Barnabas purposed to take with them John, called Mark.
But Paul deemed worthy, having withdrawn from them from Pamphylia, and not having come with them to the work, not to take him with them.
Therefore there was an incitement, so that they separated from one another: and Barnabas, having taken Mark, sailed to Cyprus;
And Paul, having chosen Silas, went forth, having been delivered to the grace of God by the brethren.
And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, supporting the churches.
And he arrived at Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timothy, son of a certain woman, a faithful Jewess; and of a Greek father:
Who was testified of by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.
Him Paul wished to go forth with him; and having taken, he circumcised him, on account of the Jews being in those places: for all knew his father that he was a Greek.
And as they were going through the cities, they delivered them the orders to watch, having been determined by the sent and the elders in Jerusalem.
Therefore truly the churches were rendered firm in faith, and abounded in number daily.
And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country, hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia,
Having come to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia: and the Spirit suffered them not.
And having passed by Mysia they came down to Troas.
And a vision was seen to Paul by night; A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing, beseeching him, and saying, Having passed to Macedonia, help us.
And when he saw the vision, we quickly sought to come out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord called us to announce good news to them.
Therefore having been conveyed from Troas, we ran straight forward to Samothracia, and the following day to Neapolis;
And thence to Philippi, which is the first city of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in that city passing certain days.
And the day of the sabbaths we came out of the city by the river, where prayer was customary to be; and having sat down, we spake to the women come together.
And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a dealer in purple garments, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, heard: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to things spoken by Paul.
And when she was immersed, and her house, she besought, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having come into my house, remain. And she forced us.
And it was we going for prayer, a certain young girl having the spirit of Python met us, who furnished much gain to her lords, prophesying:
She having followed Paul and us, cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, who announce to us the way of salvation.
And this did she for many days. And Paul, having been exercised, and having turned back to the spirit, said, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.
And her lords having seen that the hope of their gain went out, taking Paul and Silas, they drew to the assembly to the rulers,
And having brought them to the generals, they said, These the men who cause disturbance to our city, being Jews,
And they announce customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor do, being Romans.
And the crowd set together against them: and the generals having rent their garments, commanded to scourge with rods.
And many blows having been put upon them, they cast into prison, having commanded the jailor to keep them safely:
Who, having received such an order, cast them into the inner prison, and placed their feet firmly in wood.
And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, praised God: and the imprisoned heard them.
And suddenly was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all were let loose.
And the jailor being awakened, and having seen the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the imprisoned to have fled.
And Paul called with a great voice, saying, Thou shouldest do no injury to thyself; for we are all here.
And having asked for a light, he rushed in, and being trembling, fell before Paul and Silas,
And bringing them out, he said, Lords, what must I do that I might be saved.
And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
And they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all in his house.
And having taken them in that hour of the night, he washed out the blows; and was immersed, he and all his, immediately.
And having brought them up to his house, he set a table before, and rejoiced with the entire household, having believed God.
And it being day, the generals sent the bearers of the rod, saying, Loose these men.
And the jailor announced these words to Paul, That the generals have sent that ye be loosed: now therefore having come out, go in peace.
But Paul said to them, Having stripped us publicly not condemned, being Roman men, they cast into prison and now do they cast us out secretly? not so; but having come themselves, let them bring us out.
And the bearer of the rod announced these words to the generals: and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans.
And having come they besought them, and having brought out, they entreated to come out of the city.
And having come out of prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they encouraged them, and they came forth.
And having passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
And according to custom to Paul, he went in to them, and upon three sabbaths discussed with them from the writings,
Opening and setting before, that it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and rise from, the dead; and that this is Christ Jesus, whom I announce to you.
And certain of them were persuaded, and were assigned by lot to Paul and Silas; and of worshipping Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the first women.
And the unbelieving Jews, having been jealous, and having taken certain evil men of the vulgar, and excited to tumult, they disturbed the city by loud noise, and having stood against the house of Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace.
And not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the city, crying, That those having subverted the habitable globe, these also are present here;
Which Jason has received: and these all do opposite to Caesar's enactments, saying, There is another king, Jesus.
And they troubled the crowd and rulers of the city, having heard these.
And having taken sufficient of Jason, and the rest, they loosed them.
And the brethren quickly sent out both Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who arriving went away to the synagogue of the Jews.
And they were of more noble birth than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, and examined the writings daily, if these things might hold thus.
Therefore truly many of them believed; and of the distinguished Grecian women, and of men, not few.
And when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that also in Berea the word of God was announced by Paul, they came there also, agitating the crowd.
And quickly the brethren sent away Paul to go as by the sea: and both Silas and Timothy remained there.
And they conveying Paul brought him even to Athens: and having taken a command to Silas and Timothy that now they might come to him most speedily, they departed.
And Paul waiting for them among the Athenians, his spirit was excited in him, seeing the city being addicted to idol worship.
Therefore truly he discussed in the synagogue with Jews, and those worshipping, and in the assembly in every day with those being present.
And certain of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers deliberated with him. And certain said, What may this idle, talkative man wish to say? and others, He seems to be a declarer of strange demons: because he announced to them good news, and the rising up.
And having taken him, they brought upon Mars' hill, saying, Can we know what this new teaching is, spoken by thee?
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we wish therefore to know what these things may be.
(And all the Athenians and strangers being present, passed time in nothing else but to say or hear some thing new.)
And Paul having stood in the midst of Mars' hill, said, Men, Athenians, I see that in all things ye have a superstitious fear of divinity.
For having passed by, and beholding your venerations, I found also an altar upon which was inscribed, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom not knowing therefore ye reverence, him I announce to you.
God having made the world and all things in it, he being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made by hands;
Nor is served by men's hands, standing in need of anything, he giving to all life, and breath, and all things.
And he made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having limited the times before arranged, and the bounds of their habitation;
To seek the Lord, if perchance indeed they have felt for him, and found, although not being far from each one of us:
For in him we live, and move, and are; as certain of the composers among you have said, For we also are his race.
Being therefore the posterity of God, we ought not to think gold, or silver, or stone, an engraving of art, or meditation of man, the divinity to be like.
Therefore truly, God having overlooked the times of ignorance, now announces to all men everywhere to repent:
Wherefore he set a day, in which he is about to judge the habitable globe in justice by the man whom he appointed; having offered faith to all, having raised him from the dead.
And having heard of the rising up of the dead, they treated with mockery; and said, We will hear thee again concerning this.
And so Paul went forth from the midst of them.
And certain men having joined him, believed: among whom also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them.
And after these Paul having departed from Athens, came to Corinth;
And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontian by birth, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; (for Claudius had ordered all Jews to be separated from Rome:) came to them.
And because being of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought: for they were by trade tentmakers.
And he discussed in the synagogue on every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was oppressed in spirit, testifying to the Jews Jesus Christ.
And they opposing, and blaspheming, having shaken off the garments violently, he said to them, Your blood upon your head; I clean: from now will I go to the nations.
And having gone away thence, he came to the house of a certain Justus by name, worshipping God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.
And Crispus, ruler of the synagogue, believed the Lord with his whole house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptised.
And the Lord said through a vision by night to Paul, Fear not, but speak, and thou shouldest not be silent:
For I am with thee, and none shall attack thee to injure thee: for much people are to me in this city.
And he sat a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews arose unanimously against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
Saying, This one persuades men to worship God against the law.
And Paul being about to open the mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore it were truly any injustice or wicked, criminal action, O Jews, against the word, I should have borne with you:
But if it is a question of the word, and names, and law, according to you, see ye yourselves; for I will not be judge of these.
And he drave them away from the judgment seat.
And all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, ruler of the synagogue, beat before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these.
And Paul yet having remained sufficient days, having taken leave of the brethren, sailed out to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn the head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.
And Paul arrived at Ephesus, and left those of his: and he having come into the synagogue, discussed with the Jews.
And they asking to remain with them for more time, he acquiesced not;
But he took leave of them, saying, I must at any rate do the coming festival in Jerusalem: and I will again return to you, God willing. And he was conveyed from Ephesus.
And having come down to Cesarea having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.
And having made a certain time, he came out, passing in order the Galatian country and Phrygia, supporting all the disciples.
And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the writings.
He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and boiling up in the spirit, he spake and taught attentively the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.
And he began to speak freely in the synagogue: and Priscilla and Aquila having heard him, took him, and set forth to him the way of God more accurately.
And he wishing to pass through to Achaia, the brethren having encouraged, wrote to the disciples to receive him: who having arrived, profited much them having believed through grace:
For he mightily refuted the Jews publicly, shewing by the writings Jesus to be Christ.
And it was in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having passed through the higher parts, came to Ephesus: and having found certain disciples,
He said to them, Having believed, have ye received the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, But neither heard we if there be a Holy Spirit.
And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.
And Paul said, John truly immersed the immersion of repentance, saying to the people, that they should believe on him coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus.
And they having heard, were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And Paul having laid hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
And all the men were about twelve.
And having come into the synagogue, he spake freely, discoursing for three months, and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
And when certain were hardened, and believed not, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing in the day in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
And this was for two years: so that all dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
And God did special powers by Paul's hands:
So that also upon the sick were brought from his body napkins or aprons, and diseases were removed from them, and evil spirits came out of them.
And certain of the wandering Jews, exorcists, undertook to call over them having evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.
And there were certain sons of Sceva, a Jew, chief priest, seven doing this.
And the evil spirit having answered, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
And the man leaping upon them in whom the evil spirit was, and having overpowered them, he was strong against them, so that naked and wounded they fled out of the house.
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
And many of them having believed came, acknowledging and proclaiming their deeds.
And sufficient of them having done unnecessary things, having brought books together, burned before all: and computed their prices, and found fifty thousand of silver.
Thus with might the word of the Lord increased, and was strong.
And when these were completed, Paul proposed in spirit, having passed through Macedonia and Achaia to go to Jerusalem, saying, That after have been there, I must also see Rome.
And having sent into Macedonia two of them serving him, Timothy, and Erastus, he stopped a season in Asia.
And in that time was there no little trouble about the way.
For a certain Demetrius by name, a silversmith, making the silver temples of Diana, furnished no little work to artificers;
Whom having collected together and the workmen of such things, he said, Men, ye know that out of this work is our good food.
And ye see and hear that not only Ephesus, but almost all Asia, this Paul having persuaded, changed a sufficient crowd, saying, that they are not gods made by hands:
And not only this part is in danger to us to come to reproach; but also the temple of the great goddess Diana to be reckoned for nothing, and her greatness also about to be destroyed, whom the whole of Asia and the habitable globe worship.
And having heard, and been filled with wrath, they cried, saying, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.
And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed unanimously into the theatre, having taken away together Gains and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's companions of the journey.
And Paul wishing to come in to the people, the disciples suffered him not.
And certain also of the chief of Asia, being friends to him, having sent to him, besought not to give himself into the theatre.
Others truly cried some other things: for the church was confused; and the most knew not for what they had come together.
And they forced Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having put him forward. And Alexander having shaken the hand, wished to justify himself to the people.
And having known that he is a Jew, there was one voice from all crying for about two hours, Great the Diana of the Ephesians.
And the scribe having calmed the crowd, says, Men, Ephesians, for who is the man that knows not the city of the Ephesians, being temple keeper of the great goddess Diana, and sent by Jove?
Therefore these things not being refuted, it is necessary for you to be restrained, and to do nothing rash.
For ye brought these men not sacrilegious, nor blaspheming your goddess.
If truly therefore Demetrius, and the artificers with him, have a word against any, the court days are kept, and there are proconsuls; let them prosecute one another.
But if ye inquire anything concerning, other things, it shall be explained in a lawful assembly.
For we are also in danger to be called in question for this day, being no cause for which we shall be able to give back word of this confederation.
And having said these, he loosed the assembly.
And after the uproar was ceased, Paul having called the disciples, and greeted, he came out to go into Macedonia.
And having passed through those parts, and having besought them by much speech, he came into Greece.
And having made three months; an insidious plot having been for him by the Jews, being about to sail to Syria, there was a purpose to return through Macedonia.
And there agreed with him as far as Asia Sopater a Berean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
These having come before awaited us in Troas.
And we sailed forth after the days of unleavened from Philippi, and came to them in Troas up to five days; where we tarried seven days.
And in one of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled together to break bread, Paul conversed with them being about to go forth the morrow; and he continued the word until midnight.
And sufficient lights were in the upper room, where they were assembled.
And a certain young man by name Eutychus, sitting in the window, borne down by deep sleep, Paul conversing more and more, fell down below from the third story, and was taken up dead.
And Paul having gone down, fell upon him, and embracing, said, Be not disturbed, for his soul is in him.
And having gone up, and broken bread, and tasted, and conversed for a sufficient time, till the light, so he went forth.
And they brought the child living, and were not little comforted.
And we having gone before to the ship, sailed to Assos, there being about to take up Paul: for so had he ordered, being about himself to go on foot.
And when he joined us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.
And from thence having sailed away, the following day we arrived over against Chios; and the other day we approached to Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, the following day we came to Miletus.
For Paul determined to sail to Ephesus, as it might not be to him to spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible to him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
And having sent from Miletus to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I embarked for Asia, how I was with you all the time.
Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, having happened to me by the insidious plots of the Jews:
How I concealed nothing of things profitable, not to announce to you, and teach you publicly, and in the houses,
Testifying to both Jews, and Greeks, repentance towards God, and the faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.
And now, behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things going to happen to me in it;
But that the Holy Spirit testifies in the city, saying that bonds and pressures await me.
But the word of none do I make mine own, neither have I my soul highly prized to myself, in order to finish my course with joy, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.
And now, behold, I know that all ye shall see my face no more, among whom I passed through, proclaiming the kingdom of God.
Wherefore I testify to you in this day, that I pure from the blood of all.
For I concealed not to announce to you all the counsel of God.
Attend therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit set you inspectors, to feed the church of God, which he acquired by his own blood.
For I know this, that there shall come in after my departure grievous wolves to you, not sparing the flock.
And of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to tear away disciples after them.
Wherefore watch ye, remembering that the space of three years night and day I ceased not reminding each one with tears.
And now I commit you, brethren, to God, and to the word of his grace, being able to build up, and give you inheritance among all the consecrated.
Silver or gold, or clothing, of none have I eagerly desired.
And ye yourselves know, that to my necessities, and to those being with me, these hands served.
I shewed you all things, that so being wearied ye must support the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that himself said, It is happy to give rather than receive.
And having said these, having placed his knees, he prayed with them all.
And much weeping was from all; and having fallen upon Paul's neck, they kissed him,
Grieving chiefly for the word which he spake, that they are about to see his face no more. And they sent him forward to the ship.
And it was, as we were conducted forth, torn asunder from them, having run straight forward, we came to Coos, and in continuation to Rhodes, and thence to Patara:
And having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having embarked, we were conducted forth.
And having been shown Cyprus, and left it at the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and were conveyed to Tyre: for thither was the ship discharging the lading.
And having found disciples, we remained there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.
And it was when we accomplished the days, having come out we went; all sending us forward, with wives and children, even to without the city: and having placed the knees upon the seashore, we prayed.
And having greeted one another, we embarked in the ship; and these returned to their own.
And we having finished the voyage from Tyre, arrived at Ptolemais, and having greeted the brethren, we remained one day with them.
And the morrow, they about Paul having come out, came to Cesarea: and having come to Philip's house, bearer of good news, being of the seven, we remained with him.
And to him were four daughters, virgins, prophesying.
And we remaining many days, a certain prophet came down from Judea, by name Agabus.
And having come to us, and lifted up Paul's girdle, and bound his hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle, shall the Jews so bind in Jerusalem, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the nations.
And when we heard these things, both we, and the nations, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
And Paul answered, What do ye weeping and breaking my heart? for I not only to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem, have prepared for the name of the Lord Jesus.
And he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
And after these days, having packed up, we went up to Jerusalem.
And there came also with us of disciples from Cesarea, bringing with whom we should be received as guests to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an ancient disciple.
And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
And the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.
And having greeted them, he recounted to each one what things God had done among the nations through his service.
And they having heard, honoured the Lord, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many ten thousands of Jews there are having believed: and all are zealous of the law:
And they were taught about thee, that thou teachest apostasy from Moses, all the Jews among the nations, saying, they are not to circumcise children, nor walk in the customs.
What is it therefore? the multitude must all come together: for they will hear that thou hast come.
Therefore do this which we say to thee: Four men are to us having a vow upon them;
Having taken these, be purified with them, and expend upon them, that they might shave the head: and all might know that what they are taught about thee is nothing; but thou proceedest in regular order, also thyself watching the law.
And of the nations having believed, we have written having judged them to keep nothing such, except to watch themselves from that sacrificed to idols, and blood, and strangulation, and harlotry.
Then Paul having taken the men, in the following day having been purified with them, went into the temple, announcing the completion of the days of purification, till an offering be brought for each one of them.
And when the seven days were about completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, embroiled all the crowd, and put hands upon them,
Crying out, Men, Israelites, help: This is the man, teaching all, everywhere, against the people, and the law, and this place: and yet also brought the Greeks into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.
(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.)
And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people: and having taken up Paul, they drew him out of the temple: and quickly the doors were shut.
And seeking to kill him, a rumor went up to the captain of a thousand of the band, that the whole of Jerusalem had been embroiled.
Who having taken out of it the soldiers and centurions, he ran down to them: and they having seen the captain of a thousand and the soldiers, ceased striking Paul.
Then the captain of a thousand, having drawn near, took him, and commanded to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.
And other cried what other in the crowd: and not being able to know certainly for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the camp.
And when he was upon the steps, it happened, he was borne by the soldiers for the violence of the crowd.
For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Take him away.
And being about to be brought into the camp, Paul says to the captain of a thousand, Is it lawful for me to speak anything to thee? and he said, Hast thou knowledge in Greek?
Art not thou then the Egyptian, who before these days having risen up, and having brought into the desert four thousand men of murderers?
And Paul said, I am truly a man a Jew, a Tarsean of Cilicia, a citizen of no undistinguished city: and I beseech of thee to give way for me to speak to the people.
And having given way, Paul standing upon the steps, shook with the hand to the people. And being much silence, he spake in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence to you.
(And having heard that he spake to them in Hebrew dialect, they held more silence: and he says,)
I am truly a Jew, a man born in Tarsus, of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of the fathers' law, being zealous of God, as all ye are this day.
Who drove out this way even to death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women.
As also the chief priest testifies of me, and all the council of elders: and whose letters to the brethren having received, I went to Damascus, going to bring there the bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.
And it was to me going, and drawing near to Damascus about noon, suddenly much light from heaven flashed around me,
And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out?
And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarite, whom thou drivest out.
And they being with me truly saw the light, and were terrified; but they heard not the voice of him speaking to me.
And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Having risen, go to Damascus; and there shall be told thee of all which has been arranged for thee to do.
And when I saw not from the glory of that light, led by the hand of them being with me I came to Damascus.
And a certain Ananias, a religious man according to the law, testified of by all the Jews dwelling,
Having come to me, and stood, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And the same hour I looked up to him.
And he said, The God of our fathers took thee in hand, to know his will, and to see the Just, and hear the voice from his mouth.
For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and hast heard.
And now what art thou about to do having risen, be immersed and wash away thy sins, having called upon the name of the Lord.
And it was to me returning to Jerusalem, and praying in the temple, I was in a deep trance:
And saw him saying to me, Hasten, and come quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony of me.
And I said, Lord, these know that I was imprisoning and skinning in the synagogues them believing on thee:
And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself was standing by, and assenting to his murder, and watching the garments of them murdering him.
And he said to me, Go: for I will send thee far off to the nations.
And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voices, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not suitable for him to live.
And they vociferating, and casting garments away, and throwing a cloud of dust into the air,
The captain of a thousand commanded him to be brought to the camp, having spoken to examine him by scourges; that he might know for what cause they exclaimed so against him.
And as he held him before with thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful to scourge a man a Roman, and uncondemned?
And the centurion having heard, having come near announced to the captain of a thousand, See what thou art about to do: for this man is a Roman.
And the captain of a thousand having come near, said to him, Tell me if thou art a Roman. And he said, Yes.
And the captain of a thousand answered, I obtained this citizenship for much capital. And Paul said, And I have been born.
Then quickly they about to examine him withdrew from him: and the captain of a thousand was afraid, knowing that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him.
And on the morrow, wishing to know the certainty that why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from bonds, and commanded the chief priests and the whole of their council to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him among them.
And Paul, having looked intently to the council, said, Men, brethren, I have lived as a citizen in all good conscience to God till this day.
And the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike his month.
Then said Paul to him, God is about to strike thee, thou wall covered with dust: and sittest thou judging me according to law, and commanded me to be struck illegally?
And they standing by said, Revilest thou God's chief priest?
And Paul said, I knew not, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it has been written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
And Paul having known that one part is of the Sadducees, and the other of the Pharisees, cried in the council, Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee, son of a Pharisee: for the hope and rising up of the dead am I judged.
And he having spoken this, there was a dissension of the Pharisees and Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.
For truly the Sadducees say there is no rising up, neither messenger, nor spirit: and the Pharisees acknowledge both.
And there was a great cry: and the scribes of the Pharisees' part, having risen, struggled with obstinacy, saying, We find nothing evil in this man: but if a spirit or messenger spake to him, we should not contend against God.
And there being much dissension, the captain of a thousand, having dreaded lest Paul be torn asunder by them, commanded the army, having gone down, to snatch him from the midst of them, and bring into the camp.
And the following night the Lord, having stood by him, said, Take courage, Paul: for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so must thou also testify at Rome.
And it being day, certain of the Jews having made a condition, anathematized themselves, saying, neither to eat or drink till they kill Paul.
And there were more than forty having made this conspiracy.
Who having come to the chief priests and elders, said, By an anathema, we anathematized ourselves, to taste of nothing till we kill Paul.
Now therefore do ye exhibit to the captain of a thousand, with the council, so that to-morrow he might bring him down to you, as about to examine more accurately the things concerning him: and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him.
And Paul's sister's son having heard of the ambuscade, having approached, and come into the camp, announced to Paul.
And Paul having called one of the centurions, said, Bring this young man to the captain of a thousand; for he has something to announce to him.
Then truly having taken him, he brought to the captain of a thousand, and says, Paul, the bound, having called me, asked to bring this young man to thee, having something to say to thee.
The captain of a thousand, having taken his hand, and having withdrawn in private, inquired, What is it which thou hast to announce to me?
And he said, That the Jews agreed together to ask thee, so that to-morrow thou mightest bring down Paul to the council, as about to inquire something more accurately about him.
Therefore thou shouldest not be persuaded by them: for more than forty men of them lie in wait for him, who anathematized themselves, neither to eat or drink till they should kill him: and now are they prepared, expecting a promise from thee.
Truly then the captain of a thousand discharged the young man, having enjoined him, Tell none that thou hast shown these things to me.
And having called two certain of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, so that they go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred having held spears in the right hand, at the third hour of the night;
And to bring forward cattle to set Paul upon, that they might carry through safely to Felix the leader.
Having written a letter containing this type.
Claudius Lysias to the most excellent leader Felix, health.
This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them: having stood with an army, I took him away, having learned that he is a Roman.
And wishing to know the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down to this council:
Whom I found accused of questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or of bonds.
And the plot about to be by the Jews, having been made known to me against the man, for this I sent to thee, having also commanded the accusers to say things against him to thee. Farewell.
Then truly the soldiers according to that appointed them, having taken up Paul, brought by night to Antipatris.
And the morrow; having suffered the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the camp:
Who having come into Cesarea and given up the letter to the leader, they also placed Paul before him.
And the leader having read, and asked of what province he is, and having understood from Cilicia;
I will hearken to thee, he said, when also thine accusers should be present. And he commanded him to be watched in Herod's pretorium.
And after five days the chief priest Ananias came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who exhibited to the leader against Paul.
And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,
Attaining much peace by thee, and good actions being to this nation by thy foresight altogether and everywhere, we accept, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
And that I hinder thee no more, I beseech thee to hear us concisely by thy clemency.
For having found this man a scourge, and moving sedition to all Jews in the habitable globe, and standing in the first rank of the sect of Nazarites:
And who attempted to profane the temple: whom we also seized, and wished to judge according to our law.
And Lysias the captain of a thousand, having come with much force, carried away out of our hands,
Having commanded his accusers to come to thee: by which thou thyself shalt be able, having examined, to know of all these of which we accuse him.
And the Jews also agreed, saying, these things hold so.
And Paul answered, the leader having nodded to him to speak, Knowing from many years thee being judge to this nation, more cheerfully do I justify things concerning myself:
Thou being able to know that not more than twelve days are to me from which I went up, going to worship in Jerusalem.
And neither in the temple found they me discussing with any, or making a revolt of the crowd, neither in synagogues, nor in the city:
Nor can they bring me forward for things they now accuse me.
And this I confess to thee, that according to the way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things written in the law and the prophets:
Having hope to God, which they themselves also admit, a rising from the dead about to be, both of just and unjust.
And in this I myself attend carefully, to have a conscience unhurt towards God and men always.
And after many years I was present, going to do alms to my nation, and offerings.
In which they found me purified in the temple, not with the crowd, nor with uproar, and certain Jews from Asia.
Who ought to be present to thee, and accuse, if they have anything against me.
Or let these themselves say, if they found any injustice in me, I having stood before the council,
Or of this one voice, which I cried standing with them, That of the rising up of the dead I am judged this day by you.
And having heard these, Felix deferred them, knowing more accurately the things of the way, having said, When Lysias captain of a thousand shall come down, I will examine narrowly things concerning you.
And having appointed a centurion to keep Paul, and to have a setting at liberty, and to hinder none of his own to serve or come to him.
And after certain days, Felix, having been present with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, sent for Paul and heard him of the faith in Christ.
And he discoursing of justice, and temperance, and judgment about to be, Felix being terrified, answered, Having now, go; having taken time, I will recall thee.
And at the same time also hoping that money should be given him by Paul, so that he might loose him: wherefore also sending for him more frequently, he conversed with him.
And two years completed, Felix took Porcius Festus, a successor: and wishing to render a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.
Festus therefore having come to the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Cesarea.
And the chief priest and first of the Jews exhibited to him against Paul, and besought him,
Asking favor against him, that he might send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambuscade to kill him in the way.
Then truly answered Festus, Paul to be kept in Cesarea, and himself quickly about to go forth.
Therefore the able among you, he says, having gone down together, if there be anything in this man, let them accuse him.
And having tarried with them more than ten days, having gone down to Cesarea, on the morrow, having sat upon the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.
And he having come, the Jews having come down from Jerusalem stood round about, bringing many and heavy charges against Paul, which they could not prove.
He justifying himself, That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I sinned any thing.
And Festus, wishing to render a favor to the Jews, having answered Paul, said, Wilt thou, having gone up to Jerusalem, there be judged by me of these things?
And Paul said, At Caesar's judgment seat am I standing where I must he judged: I injured the Jews nothing, as thou also knowest better.
For if truly I act with injustice, and have done anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing of which these accuse me, no one can yield me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.
Then Festus, having conversed with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar, to Caesar shalt thou go.
And certain days having intervened, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Cesarea, having saluted Festus.
And as they tarried there many days, Festus set up to the king the things of Paul, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:
About whom, I being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews exhibited, asking judgment against him.
To whom I answered, That it is not the custom to Romans to yield up any man to destruction, before that the accused may have the accusers before the face, and take place for defence for the accusation.
Therefore, they having come here together, having made no delay, in order having sat upon the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.
About whom the accusers, having stood up, brought no charge of what I supposed:
But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and of a certain Jesus, having died, whom Paul declared living.
And I doubting at the question concerting this, said, If he be willing to go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.
And Paul having appealed for him to be kept for the determination of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I send him to Caesar.
And Agrippa said to Festus, I wished myself also to hear the man. And he said, Tomorrow thou shalt hear him.
Therefore the morrow, Agrippa having come, and Bernice, with much display, and having come into the hall, also with captains of thousands, and men of the city being in eminence, and Festus having commanded, Paul was brought.
And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men being present with us, ye behold this, of whom all the multitude of Jews addressed me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out he must no more live.
And I discovering nothing he has done worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Augustus, I judged to send him.
Of whom I have not anything certain to write to the lord. Wherefore I brought him to you, and especially to thee, king Agrippa, so that, examination having been, I should have some thing to write.
For it seems to me unreasonable sending one in bonds, and not to signify the charges against him.
And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul defended himself, having stretched out the hand:
Concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I deem myself happy, being about to defend myself to thee this day:
Especially thee being judge of all the customs among the Jews, and also of the questions: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
Therefore truly my manner of life from youth, having been from the beginning in my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know:
Knowing me beforehand, from a former period, if they would testify, that according to the most strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.
And now in the hope of the solemn promise having been made to the fathers by God, I stand, being judged,
To which our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to arrive. For which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews.
Why is it judged incredible by you, if God raise the dead?
I therefore truly thought to myself, I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarite.
Which I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the holy ones I shut up in prison, having received authority from chief priests; and they taken up, I carried down a vote.
And in all the synagogues, many times punishing them, I compelled to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I drove out even also to cities without.
In which also going to Damascus with authority, and superintendence from the chief priests,
The middle of day, I saw in the way, O king, a light from heaven, above the brilliancy of the sun, having shone around me, and those going with me.
And we having all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out? hard for thee to kick against goads.
And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou drivest out.
But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for, for this was I sent to thee, to take thee in hand, a servant and witness both of what things thou sawest, and of what I shall be seen to thee;
Taking thee away from people, and nations, to whom I now send thee.
To open their eyes, to turn them back from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, fur them to receive remission of sins, and inheritance with the consecrated by faith in me.
Wherefore, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:
But to them in Damascus first, and Jerusalem, and all the country of Judea, and to the nations, announcing to change the mind, and to turn back to God, doing works worthy of change of mind.
For these things, me the Jews, having seized in the temple, attempted to kill with their own hands.
Therefore having obtained assistance from God, till this day do I stand, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what both the prophets and Moses spake being about to be:
That Christ exposed to suffering, that first from the rising of the dead, he is about to announce light to the people, and nations.
And he defending himself by these, Festus said with a great voice, Thou art frenzied, Paul; many letters turn thee to madness.
And he says, I am not frenzied, most excellent Festus; but I speak the words of truth and soundness of mind.
For the king knows of these, to whom speaking freely I speak: for I am persuaded that none of these are unknown to him; for these were not done in a corner.
Believest thou the prophets, king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.
And Agrippa said to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
And Paul said, I would pray to God also in little, and in much, not only thee, but also all hearing me this day to become such, of what kind I also am, besides these bonds.
And he having said these, the king arose, and the leader, and Bernice, and they sitting with them:
And having withdrawn, they spake to one another, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been loosed, if he had not appealed to Caesar.
And when it was determined for us to sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and certain others bound to a centurion named Julius, of Augustus' band.
And having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, being about to navigate places in Asia, we were conveyed; Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
And another day we were brought down to Sidon. And Julius having treated Paul affectionately, gave him up, having gone to his friends to obtain care.
And conveyed from thence, we sailed to Cyprus, for the winds were contrary.
And having sailed over the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra, of Lycia.
And there the centurion having found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, placed us upon it.
And in many days sailing slowly, and with difficulty having come to Cnidus, the wind not permitting us, we sailed under Crete, to Salmone;
And, with difficulty sailing by it, we came to a certain place called The fair havens; to which the city Lasea was near.
And a suitable time having intervened, and sailing being already dangerous, for the fast had already passed by, Paul advised,
Saying to them, Men, I see that with violence and much damage, not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives, the voyage is about to be.
But the centurion was rather persuaded by the pilot and the shipmaster, than by the things spoken by Paul.
And the harbor being not suitable for passing the winter, the greater part took counsel to be conveyed from thence, if perhaps having arrived at Phenice, they may be able to pass the winter; a harbor of Crete, looking to the south west and to the country.
And the south wind having blown softly, having thought to have obtained the purpose, hoisting up near, they sailed by Crete.
And after not much a violent wind struck against it, called Enroclydon.
And the ship having been caught, and not able to resist the wind, yielding we were carried away.
And having run under a certain island called Clauda, with difficulty were we able to be commanding the boat:
Which having taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they might fall through into the quicksand, having loosened the vessel, so were they borne away.
And we being exceedingly tempest tossed, the following day they made a casting of the cargo overboard;
And the third, working with our bands, we cast out the rigging of the ship.
And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small tempest impending, finally all hope for us to be saved was removed.
And there being much abstinence from food, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, Truly it was fitting, O men, having obeyed me, not to be conveyed from Crete, and gain this violence and damage.
And now I advise you to be cheerful: for there shall be no throwing away of soul from you, but of the ship.
For the messenger of God stood by me in this night, whose I am, and whom I serve,
Saying, Fear not, Paul; Thou must stand before Caesar: and, behold, God has bestowed on thee as a gift all these sailing with thee.
Wherefore, O men, be cheerful: for I believe God, that so it shall be as he has spoken to me.
But we must fall upon a certain island.
And when it was the fourteenth night, we being carried up and down in Adria, at midnight the sailors supposed some country brought near them;
And having sounded, they found twenty fathoms; and having removed a little, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms.
And fearing lest perhaps we might fall through into rough places, having cast four anchors from the stern, prayed for day to come.
And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having loosened the boat to the sea, for a pretext as about to extend the anchors from the prow,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these should remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.
And till it was about to be day, Paul besought all to take food, saying, Awaiting this day the fourteenth day, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing.
Wherefore I beseech you to take food: for this is for your salvation: for not a hair of the head of one of you shall fall.
And having said these, and having taken bread, he returned thanks to God before all: and having broken, he began to eat.
And all being cheerful, these also received food.
And we were, all the souls in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six.
And satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
And when it was day, they knew not the land: and they observed a certain deep bay having a coast, into which they resolved, if able, to push the ship.
And having in removed the anchors, they let go into the sea, at the same time having let loose the bonds of the rudders, and having lifted up the mizen mast, they held with the blast to the coast.
And having fallen into a place between two seas, they caused the ship to strike; and truly the prow, fixed firmly, remained undisturbed, but the stern was loosed by force of the waves.
And the soldiers' counsel was that they kill the prisoners, lest any, having swum away, may escape.
But the centurion wishing to save Paul, hindered from the resolution; and he commanded those being able to swim, having cast off first, to come to land:
And the rest, truly some on boards, and some on certain things from the ship. And so it was, all were saved upon the land.
And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita.
And the foreigners bestowed upon us no ordinary kindness: for having lighted a pile of wood, they received us all on account of the impending rain, and for the cold.
And Paul having collected together a multitude of dried sticks, and placed upon the pile of wood, a viper, having come forth out of the heat, seized his hand.
And when the foreigners saw the wild beast hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is altogether a murderer, whom, saved from the sea, vengeance suffered not to live.
Who truly then, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered nothing evil.
And they expected him about to be inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly: and they waiting for much, and seeing nothing extraordinary coming to him, changing their opinions, they said he was a god.
And with them about that place was landed property to the first of the island, by name Publius; who having received us, lodged us with friendship three days.
And it was the father of Publius lay, held fast with fever and dysentery: to whom Paul, having come in and prayed, laid hands upon him, and healed him.
Then this done, the rest having sicknesses in the island, came near, and were cured:
And they honoured us with many honours; and to us getting under weigh, they set things for need.
And after three months we were conveyed in a ship, having wintered in the island, of Alexandria, marked, Sons of Jove.
And brought down to Syracuse, we tarried yet three days longer.
Whence having come round, we arrived at Rhegium: and after one day the south wind having come up, we came the second day to Puteoli:
Where having found brethren, we were besought by them to tarry yet seven days longer: and so we came to Rome.
And thence the brethren, having heard of us, came out to our meeting as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom Paul having seen, having returned thanks to God, took courage.
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp: but to Paul it was permitted to remain by himself with a soldier watching him.
And it was after three days Paul called together them being first of the Jews: and they having come together, he said to them, Men, brethren, I having done nothing against the people, or customs of the fathers, I was delivered in bonds from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
Who, having examined me, wished to loose, for no cause of death was in me.
And the Jews saying against, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; as having nothing to accuse my nation.
For this cause therefore I besought to see you, and to speak: for, for the hope of Israel am I surrounded by this chain.
And they said to him, We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor any of the brethren having been present announced or spoke any evil of thee.
And we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for truly of this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.
And having appointed him a day, many came to him to the lodging; to whom testifying, he set forth the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morn to eve.
And some truly were persuaded by things spoken, and some disbelieved.
And being at variance with one another, they were let go, Paul having said one word, That well spake the Holy Spirit by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,
Saying, Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and ye should not perceive:
For the heart of this people was thickened, and with ears heard they heavily, and their eyes they closed; lest they should see with the eyes, and with ears should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and turn back, and I should heal them.
Be it known to you therefore, that salvation of God was sent to the nations, and they shall hear.
And he having said these things, the Jews departed, having much discussion in themselves.
And Paul remained two whole years in his own wages, and received all going to him,
Proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, unimpeded.
Paul, servant of Jesus Christ, called sent, separated to the good news of God,
(Which he before promised by his prophets in the holy writings,)
Concerning his Son born of the seed of David according to the flesh.
Determined the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the rising up of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord:
By whom we received grace and sending forth, to the obedience of faith in all nations for his name:
In whom are ye also, the called of Jesus Christ:
To all being in Rome, beloved of God, called holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I return thanks to my God by Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is announced in the whole world.
For my witness is God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, so that continually I make mention of you, always supplicating in my prayers;
If in any way I shall be prospered on my way in the will of God to come to you.
For I long to see you, That I might impart to you some spiritual grace, in order for you to be firm;
And this is, to be comforted together in you by the faith in one another both of you and of me.
And I would not ye should be ignorant, brethren, that many times I proposed to come to you, (and I was hindered till this time,) that I might have some fruit also in you, and in the rest of the nations.
Both to Greeks, and foreigners; both to wise and unwise, I am debtor.
So that for my part being zealous, also to you that in Rome, to announce the good news.
For I am not ashamed of the good news of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to all believing; both to the Jew first, and the Greek.
For the justice of God in it is revealed from faith to faith: as has been written, And the just shall live by faith.
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all profanation and injustice of men, of those detaining the truth in injustice;
Wherefore that known of God is manifest in them; for God manifested to them.
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, being understood by things made, are inspected, truly both his eternal power and divinity; so that they are inexcusable:
Wherefore having known God, not as God did they honour or return thanks; but were rendered vain in their conversations, and their heart without understanding was darkened.
Declaring themselves to be wise, they were fools,
And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of creeping things, and of quadrupeds.
Wherefore God delivered them in the eager desire of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies in themselves:
Who changed the truth of God into a falsehood, and reverenced and served the creation above him creating, who is praised forever. Amen.
Therefore God delivered them to the suffering of ignominy: for also their females changed the natural use into that against generation:
Likewise also males, leaving the natural use of the female, were set on fire in their longing for one another; males with males working deformity, and the retribution which was needed receiving in themselves for their erring.
And as they chose not to have God in knowledge, God delivered them to an adulterated purpose, to do things not fitting;
Having been filled with all injustice, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, badness; full of envy, slaughter, strife, deceit, malignity,
Whisperers, slanderers, odious to God, abusers of power, proud, tumultuous, inventors of injuries, disobedient to parents,
Destitute of understanding, unsteady, devoid of natural affection, implacable, merciless:
Who knowing the justice of God, that they doing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also approve those doing.
Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging: for in what thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou judging doest the same.
And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon them doing such things.
And thinkest thou this, O man, judging them doing such things, and doing the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
Or the abundance of his goodness and forbearance and long suffering dost thou despise; not knowing that the goodness of God brings thee to repentance?
And according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up to thyself anger in the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God;
Who will give back to each according to his works:
To them truly by perseverance of the good work they seek glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
But to them of intrigue, and are truly disobedient to the truth, and yielding to injustice, anger and wrath,
Affliction and distress, upon every soul of man working evil, both of the Jew first, and of the Greek;
But glory, and honour, and peace, to every one working good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek:
For there is no distinction of persons with God.
For as many as sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
(For not hearers of the law just with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
For when nations, not having the things of the law, by nature do the things of the law, these, not having the law, are law to themselves:
Which show the work of the law Written in their hearts, their consciousness testifying together, and between one another thoughts accusing or also excusing;)
In the day when God shall judge the concealed things of men according to my good news by Jesus Christ.
Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest upon the law, and boastest thyself in God,
And knowest the will, and triest things differing, being sounded out of the law;
And art persuaded thou thyself to be a guide of the blind, a light of them in darkness,
An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the inexperienced, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.
Therefore teaching another, teachest thou not thyself proclaiming not to steal, stealest thou?
Speaking not to commit adultery, committest thou adultery? abhorring images, committest thou sacrilege?
Thou who boastest in the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest thou God?
For the name of God by you is blasphemed in the nations, as it has been written.
For truly circumcision profits, if thou do the law: and if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision.
Therefore if uncircumcision watch the justification of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?
And shall not uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, judge thee, which by letter and circumcision a transgressor of the law?
For he in appearance, is not a Jew; neither circumcision, in appearance in the flesh:
But he in concealment, a Jew; and circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose approbation not of man, but of God.
What then the superiority of the Jew or what the advantage of circumcision?
Much according to every manner: for truly first were they trusted with the oracles of God.
For what if some disbelieved? their unbelief will not leave inactive the faith of God.
It may not be: and let God be true, and every man a liar; as has been written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest conquer in thy being judged.
And if our injustice shall recommend the justice of God, what shall we say God not unjust bringing in anger? (I speak as man).
It may not be: for how shall God judge the world.
For if the truth of God in my lying abounded to his glory; why yet am I judged as sinful?
And not, (as we are defamed, and some have declared us to say,) That we should do evil things, that good things might come: whose judgment is just.
What advantage therefore have we? Not in any way: for we before accused both Jews and Greeks, all to be under sin.
As has been written, That there is no just one, not one:
There is none understanding, there is none seeking God.
All have bent aside, together have they become unprofitable: there is none doing good, there is not even one.
Their throat an opened tomb; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps under their lips:
Whose mouth is full of cursing and harshness:
Their feet active to pour out blood:
Bruising and grievous toil in their ways:
And the way of peace they knew not:
The fear of God is not before their eyes.
And we know that whatever says the law, it speaks to them in the law: that every mouth be shut, and all the world be culpable to God.
Therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified before him: for by the law the knowledge of sin.
But now without law the justice of God has been made apparent, being testified by the law and by the prophets;
And the justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all believing: for there is no distinction:
For all have sinned, and failed of the glory of God;
Being justified as a gift by his grace by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:
Whom God had set before a propitiatory by faith in his blood, for a manifestation of his justice by passing over of sins before existing, in the sufferance of God;
For the manifestation of his justice now in time: for him to be just, and justifying him of the faith of Jesus.
Where then boasting? It was excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.
We reckon then man to be justified by faith without the works of the law.
Or only the God of the Jews? and not also of the nations? Yes, also of the nations:
Since one God, who will justify circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.
Therefore shall we leave the law inactive by faith It may not be: but we should establish the law.
What then shall we say Abraham our father to have found, according to the flesh?
For if Abraham was justified by works, he has boasting; but not toward God.
For what says the writing? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.
And to him working, the reward is not reckoned according to favor, but according to debt.
And to him not working, and believing upon him justifying the impious, his faith is reckoned for justice.
As also David speaks the happiness of the man, to whom God reckons justice without works,
Happy they whose iniquities were remitted, and whose sins were covered.
A happy man to whom the Lord should not reckon sin.
This happiness then upon circumcision, or upon uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for justice.
How then was it reckoned? to him being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith which in uncircumcision: for him to be father of all believing through uncircumcision; for justice also to be reckoned to them:
And father of circumcision to them not of circumcision only, but also to them, walking in order in the tracks of the uncircumcision, of the faith of our father Abraham.
For not by the law, the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, for him to be heir of the world, but by the justice of faith.
For if they of the law, heirs, faith was made void, and the promise left inactive:
For the law works wrath: for where is no law, no transgression.
Therefore of faith, that according to grace; the promise to be firm to all the seed; not to that of the law only, but also to that of the faith of Abraham; who is father of us all,
(As it has been written, That have set thee father of many nations,) over against him who believed God, making alive the dead, and calling things not being as being.
Who against hope believed upon hope, for him to become father of many nations, according to that said, So shall thy seed be.
And not having been weak in faith, he observed not his own body already having been dead, being about a hundred years, and the death of Sarah's womb:
And for the promise of God he was not separated by unbelief; but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God;
And made perfectly certain that, what was promised, he is able to do.
And therefore it was reckoned to him for justice.
And it was not written for him alone, that it was reckoned to him;
But also for us, to whom it is about to be reckoned, to them believing upon him having raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;
Who was delivered up for our faults, and raised up for our justification.
Justified therefore of faith we have peace with God by our Lord Jesus Christ:
By whom also we have had access by faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast upon hope of the glory of God.
And not only, but also we boast in affliction: knowing that affliction works perseverance;
And perseverance, proof; and proof, hope.
And hope shames not; for the love of God has been poured in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given us.
For yet Christ, we being weak, Recording to the time died for the impious.
For scarcely for the just will any one die: yet for the good perhaps some also would venture to die.
And God recommends his own love to us, that we yet being sinful, Christ died for us.
Much more then, justified now in his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.
For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.
And not only, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.
Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned:
(For until the law sin was in the world: and sin is not charged, being no law.
But death reigned from Adam to Moses, and upon them not having sinned upon the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is the type of him about to be.
But not as the fall, so also the favor. For if for the fall of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace, of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.
And not as by one having sinned, the gift: for truly the judgment of one to condemnation, but the favor of many falls to justification.
For if by the fall of one, death reigned by one; much more they receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of justice in life shall reign by one, Jesus Christ.)
Therefore as by the fall of one for all men to condemnation; so also by the justification of one for all men to justification of life.
For as by one man's disobedience many were constituted sinful, so also by the obedience of one shall many be constituted just.
And the law entered, that the fall might abound. And where sin abounded, grace superabounded:
That as sin reigned in death, so grace might reign by justice to life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace might abound.
It may not be. We who died to sin, shall we yet live in it?
Or know ye not, that as many of us as were immersed in Christ Jesus, we were immersed into his death?
Therefore were we buried with him by immersion into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.
For if grown together we have been in the likeness of his death, but also shall we be of the resurrection:
Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together, that the body of sin might be left inactive, for us no more to serve sin.
For he having died was justified from sin.
And if we died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him:
Knowing that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more power over him.
For he who died, died to sin once: but he who lives, lives to God.
So also ye reckon yourselves truly to be dead to sin, and living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to listen to it in its passions.
Neither present ye your members weapons of injustice to sin: but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead, and your members weapons of justice to God.
For sin shall not rule over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace It may not be.
Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, ye are servants to whom ye listen; either of sin to death, or of obedience to justice?
And grace to God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye listened from the heart to the type of teaching in which ye were delivered.
And freed from sin, ye were subdued to justice.
(I speak as man through the weakness of your flesh:) for as ye presented your members to uncleanness and iniquity; so now present ye your members servants to justice for consecration.
For when ye were servants to sin, ye were free to justice.
Therefore what fruit had ye then of what ye are now ashamed? for the end of these, death.
And now freed from sin, and subdued to God, ye have your fruit to consecration, and the end life eternal.
For the purchasing the provisions of sin, death; and the grace of God, life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Know ye not brethren, (for I speak to them knowing law,) that law rules over man as much time as he lives?
For a married woman is bound by the law to a living husband; and if the husband die, she is left inactive from the law of the husband.
Wherefore, the husband living, she shall be called adulteress if she be to another man: but if the man die, she is free from the law; not to be an adulteress, being to another man.
Therefore, my brethren, ye also were dead to the law by the body of Christ; for you not to be to another, but to him raised from the dead, that we bring forth fruit to God.
For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, those by the law, were energetic in our members to bring forth fruit to death.
And now we were left inactive from the law, having died in what we were held; so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
What then shall we say? The law sin? It may not be. But I knew not sin except by the law: for I knew not lust, if the law said not, Thou shalt not eagerly desire.
And sin, having taken occasion by the command, wrought in me every lust. For without law sin dead.
And I was living without law once: and the command having come, sin came back to life, and I died.
And the command was found to me which for life, this for death.
For sin having taken occasion by the command, deceived me completely, and by it killed me.
Therefore truly the law holy, and the command holy, and just, and good.
Was then good death to me? It may not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, by the good working death in me; that sin might be sinful to excess by the command.
For we know that the law is spiritual: and I am fleshly, sold under sin.
For what I work I know not: for what I would not, this I do; but what I hate, this I do.
And if what I would not this I do, I consent to the law that it is good.
And now I no more wish it, but sin dwelling in me.
For I know that in me dwells no good, (that is, in my flesh:) for to will lies near me; but to work good I find not.
For not what good I would, do I; but the evil I would not, this I do.
And if what I would not, this I do, I no more work it, but sin dwelling in me.
I find therefore a law to me, wishing to do good, that evil lies near me.
For I rejoice in the law of God, according to the man within:
And I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and taking me captive to the law of sin being in my members.
I an oppressed man: who shall save me from the body of this death?
I return thanks to God by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore truly with the mind I serve the law of God; and with the flesh the law of sin.
Therefore now no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of sin and death.
For the impossibility of the law, in that it was weak by the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:
That the justification of the law be filled up in us, not walking according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For they being according to the flesh mind things of the flesh; and they according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
For the thought of the flesh, death; and the thought of the Spirit, life and peace.
Wherefore the thought of the flesh enmity to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, for it cannot be.
And they being in the flesh cannot please God.
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.
And if Christ in you, truly the body dead by sin; and the Spirit life by justice.
And if the Spirit of him having raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he having raised up Christ from the dead will make alive also your mortal bodies by his Spirit dwelling in you.
Therefore, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: and if by the Spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
For ye have not received the Spirit of servitude again for fear; but have received the Spirit of adoption as a son, in which we cry, Abba, Father.
The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God:
And if children, also heirs; truly heirs of God, and coheirs of Christ; if indeed we suffer together, that we may be also glorified together.
For I reckon that the sufferings of the time now not worthy of the glory about to be revealed in us.
For the anxious expectation of the creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God.
For the creation was subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but by him having subjected in hope,
That also the creation itself be freed from servitude of corruption to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now.
And not only, but also they having the first fruits of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan in ourselves, waiting for the adoption as a son, the redemption of our body.
For by hope were we saved: but hope being seen is not hope: for what any one sees, why does he also hope?
And if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait.
And likewise also the Spirit takes hold together, and assists our weaknesses: for what we would pray for as we ought, we know not, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.
And he searching hearts knows what the thought of the Spirit, for according to God he supplicates for the holy ones.
And we know that to them loving God, all things work together for good, to them being called according to the setting up.
For whom he before knew, he also before determined of the form of the image of his Son, for him to be first born in many brethren.
And whom he before determined, these he also called: and whom he called, these he also justified: and whom he justified, these he also glorified.
What then shall we say to these? if God with us, who against us?
Who truly spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, and how not with him will he freely give us all?
Who shall demand payment for the chosen of God? God justifying.
Who, he condemning Christ having died, and rather also raised again, who is at the right hand of God, and who intercedes for us.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? pressure, or perplexity, or expulsion, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As has been written, That for thy sake we are killed the whole day; we were reckoned as sheep for slaughter.
But in all these we obtain a complete victory by him having loved us.
For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor beginnings, nor powers, nor things having stood, nor things about to be,
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
I Speak truth in Christ, I lie not, my consciousness bearing witness to me in the Holy Spirit,
That there is great grief to me and continued pain in my heart.
For I myself was praying to be anathema from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:
Who are Israelites; whose the adoption as a son, and the glory, and covenants, and legislation, and divine worship, and solemn promises;
Whose the fathers, and from whom Christ according to the flesh, who being God over all, praised forever. Amen.
And not as that the word of God has fallen through. For not they all of Israel, they which of Israel:
Neither that the seed of Abraham, are all children: but, In Isaac shall the seed be called to thee.
That is, The children of the flesh, these not the children of God: but the children of the solemn promise are reckoned for seed.
For this the word of solemn promise, According to this time will I come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.
And not only; but also Rebecca, having coition of one, Isaac our father;
(For not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that according to choice the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of him calling;)
It was said to her, That the greater shall serve the less.
As has been written, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.
What then shall we say is injustice with God? It may not be.
I will commiserate whomsoever I commiserate, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I have compassion.
Surely then, not of him willing, nor of him running, but of God commiserating.
For the writing says to Pharaoh, That for this same have I raised thee up, so that I might show in thee my power, and so that my name might be announced in all the earth.
Surely then, whom he will he commiserates, and whom he will he hardens.
Thou wilt then say to me, Why does he yet blame For who has withstood his will?
Surely, O man, who art thou replying against God? Shall the formation say to him having formed, Why hast thou made me so.
Or has not the potter power over the clay, of the same mixture truly to make one vessel for honour, and one for dishonour.
And if God, willing anger to be shown, and his power to be made known, endured in much long suffering the vessels of anger put in proper order for destruction:
And that he might make known the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared for glory.
Whom he also called us, not only from the Jews, but also of the nations?
As also he says in Hosea, I will call not my people my people; and the not loved, loved.
And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.
And Esaias cries for Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:
For finishing and cutting short the word in justice: for the Lord will make the word cut short upon the earth.
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us seed, as Sodom had we been, and as Gomorrha had we been likened.
What then shall we say? That the nations, not following justice, overtook justice, and the justice of faith.
And Israel following the law of justice, reached not the law of justice.
Wherefore? Because not of faith, but as of the works of the law. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone;
As has been written, Behold I set in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.
Brethren, truly my heart's delight and prayer to God for Israel is for salvation.
For I testify for them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
For not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own justice, they have not been subjected to the justice of God.
For Christ the end of the law for justice to every one believing.
For Moses writes the justice of the law, That the man having done these things shall live in them.
And the justice of faith says thus, Thou shouldest not say in thy heart, Who shall go up to heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)
Or, Who shall go down to the abyss? (that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.)
But what does it say? The word is near thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim;
For if thou confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart is believed for justice: and with the mouth is confessed for salvation.
For the writing says, Every one believing upon him shall not be ashamed.
For no distinction is of the Jew and also of the Greek: for the same Lord of all being rich to all calling upon him.
For every one whoever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
How then shall they call upon whom they believed not? and how shall they believe whom they heard not? and how shall they hear without him proclaiming?
And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? as has been written, How beautiful the feet of them announcing good news, peace, of them announcing good things!
But not all listened to the good news. For Esaias says, Lord, who believed our report?
Therefore faith, from the report, and report by the word of God.
But I say, Have they not heard? Surely, in all the earth went out their sound, and their words to the end of the habitable globe.
But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will make you jealous of not a nation, and by a shortsighted nation will I anger you.
And Esaias is very confident, and says, I was found of them not seeking me; I was manifested to them not asking for me.
And to Israel he says, The whole day have I unfolded my hands to an unbelieving and contradicting people.
I say then, Has God rejected his people It may not be. For I also am an Israelite, of Abraham's seed, of the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Or know ye not in Elias, what says the writing? how he addresses God against Israel, saying,
Lord, thy prophets have they killed, and dug down thine altars; and I alone was left, and they seek my soul.
But what say to him the intimations of divine will I have left to myself seven thousand men, who bent not the knee to Baal.
So then also in the time now has been a remnant according to the election of grace.
And if to grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. And if of works, it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
What then What Israel seeks for, this be attained not; but the selection attained, and the rest were hardened.
(As has been written, God gave them the spirit of mortal pain, eyes not to see, and earn not to hear;) even to this day.
And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for booty, and for a stumblingblock, and for a retribution to them:
Let their eyes be darkened not to see, and let them bend their back always.
I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? It may not be: but by their fall salvation to the nations, to make them jealous.
And if their fall the riches of the world, and their disaster the riches of the nations; how much more their fulness?
(For I speak to you the nations, inasmuch as truly I am the sent of the nations, I highly value my service:
If in some way I might make jealous my flesh, and I might save some of them.)
For if their rejection the reconciliation of the world, what the reception, but life from the dead?
And if the first fruit holy, also the mixture: and if the root holy, also the young shoots.
And if certain of the young shoots were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in them, and wert a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
Act not proudly to the young shoots. And if thou boastest, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
Thou wilt say then, That the young shoots were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
Well; for unbelief were they broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but do thou fear:
For if God spared not the young shoots according to nature, how will he either spare thee.
Behold then the goodness and severity of God: truly upon the fallen, severity; and upon thee, goodness, if thou continue in goodness: otherwise shalt thou also be cut off.
And they also, if they continue not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.
For if thou according to nature wert cut out of the wild olive tree, and against nature wert grafted into the cultivated olive tree: how much more these, according to nature, shall be grafted into their own olive tree.
For I will not ye should not know, brethren, this mystery, lest ye be wise with yourselves; for hardness from part has been to Israel, till the filling up of the nations come in.
And so all Israel shall be saved: as has been written, The Deliverer shall come out of Sion, and turn away profanation from Jacob.
And this the covenant to them with me, when I take away their sins.
Truly concerning the good news, enemies for you: and concerning the selection, beloved for the fathers.
For the favors and calling of God not causing repentance.
For as also ye, when ye were disobedient to God, but now ye have been commiserated by the unbelief of these:
So they now also were disobedient, by your mercy that they also be commiserated.
For God shut them all up together in unbelief, that he might commiserate all.
O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! His judgments how unsearchable, and his ways not traced out!
For who knew the mind of the Lord? or who was his counsel?
Or who first gave to him, and it shall be given back to him?
For of him, and by him, and to him, all things: to him the glory forever Amen.
I Beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, your reasonable service.
And be ye not conformed to this life, but be transformed by the renovation of your mind, for you to prove what the good, and the pleasing, and the perfected will of God.
For I say, by the race given me, to every one being with you, not to entertain a high opinion of one's self above what is fitting to think: but to think to be discreet, as God has divided the measure of faith to each.
For as in one body we have many members, and all members have not the same action:
So we, the many, are one body in Christ, and the members for one another.
And having gifts different according to the grace given us, whether prophecy, according to the due proportion of faith;
Whether service, in service: whether he teaching, in instruction;
Whether he beseeching, in supplication: he imparting, in simplicity; he placed before, in earnestness; he compassionating, in cheerfulness.
Love unfeigned. Hating evil; fastened to good.
In brotherly love, being kindly affectioned to one another; in honour preceding one another.
In study not slothful; boiling in the spirit; serving the Lord;
Rejoicing in hope; holding out under pressure; persevering in prayer;
Participating in the necessities of the holy ones; pursuing hospitality.
Praise them driving you out: praise ye, and curse not.
To rejoice with the rejoicing, and weep with the weeping.
Thinking the same towards one another. Not thinking high things but being led by humble things. Be not wise with yourselves.
Giving hack evil for evil to none. Providing good things before all men.
If possible of you, living peaceably with all men.
Avenging not yourselves, beloved, but give ye place to anger: for it has been written, Vengeance to me; I will repay, says the Lord.
If therefore thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for doing this, thou shalt heap up coals of fire on his head.
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Let every soul be placed under the protecting powers. For there is no power except from God: and the powers being, were ordered by God.
So he opposing the power, has resisted the arrangement of God: and they having resisted shall receive to themselves judgment.
For rulers are not the terror of good works, but of evil. And wilt thou not fear the power do good, and thou shalt have approbation of it:
For he is servant of God to thee for good. And if thou do evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword without order: for he is servant of God, avenging for anger to him doing evil.
Wherefore necessity to be placed under, not only for anger, but also for consciousness.
For this also pay ye taxes: for they are workmen of God, persevering in this same.
Therefore restore debts to all; to whom tribute, tribute; to whom recompense, recompense; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.
Owe ye nothing to none, except to love one another: for he loving another has completed the law.
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet; and if any other command in this word it is summed up, in it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
Love works no evil to the neighbor: love therefore the completion of the law.
And this, knowing the time, that already the hour ye should be awakened out of sleep: for now our salvation nearer than when we believed.
The night has advanced, and the day has drawn near: therefore let us lay down the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.
As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in revelries and drunkenness, not in coition and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not consideration for the flesh, for the passions.
Him being weak in faith receive ye, not to judgments of conversations.
One truly believes to eat all things: and he being weak eats vegetables.
Let not him eating despise him not eating: and let not him not eating judge him eating: for God has received him.
Who art thou judging another's servant? to his own lord he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand: for God is powerful to make him stand.
For one truly judges day above day: and one judges every day. Let each one be perfectly certain in his own mind.
He minding the day, minds to the Lord; and he not minding the day, to the Lord he minds not. He eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he not eating, to the Lord he eats not, and he gives thanks to God.
For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.
For whether we live, to the Lord we live: and whether we die, to the Lord we die: therefore whether we live, and whether we die, we are of the Lord.
For, for this Christ also died, and also arose, and returned again to life, that he might also reign over the dead and the living.
And why judgest thou thy brother? or why also despisest thou thy brother? for we shall all stand at the judgment seat of Christ.
For it has been written, I live, says the Lord, for to me shall every knee bend, and every tongue acknowledge to God.
So therefore shall each of us give word for himself to God.
Then let us no more judge one another: but rather judge ye this, not to put a stumble or offence to thy brother.
I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing common by itself; except to any one reckoning to be common, to that one it is common.
And if by food thy brother is grieved, thou no more walkest by love. Not by thy food destroy him, for whom Christ died.
Therefore let not your good be defamed.
For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For he in these serving Christ, pleasing to God, and acceptable to men.
So therefore, let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for the building up for one another.
Not for sake of food destroy thou the work of God. Truly all things clean; but evil to the man eating by offence.
Good not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor in what thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.
Thou has faith; have to thyself before God. Happy he judging not himself in what he proves.
And he being judged if he eat, has been condemned for not of faith; and everything not of faith is sin.
And we the able ought to bear the weaknesses of the unable and not please ourselves.
For let each of us please the neighbor for good to the building.
For Christ also pleased not himself, but as has been written, The reproaches of them reproaching thee fell upon me.
For whatever before was written before are for our instruction was before written that by patience and consolation able of the writings we might have hope.
And may the God of patience and his consolation give you to mind the same in one another according to Christ Jesus:
That unanimously in one mouth ye should glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore receive ye one another, as also Christ received us to the glory of God.
And I say Jesus Christ has become the servant of circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers:
And the nations to glorify God for mercies; as has been written, For this will I acknowledge to thee in the nations; and I will play on, the harp to thy name.
And again he says, Rejoice, ye nations, with his people.
And again, Praise the Lord, all ye nations; and land him all ye people.
And again Esaias says, The root shall be of Jesse, and he having risen to rule over the nations; upon him shall the nations hope.
And may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, for you to abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
And I am persuaded my brethren, and I myself for you, that ye yourselves also are full of goodness, tilled with all knowledge, being able also to remind one another.
And I wrote to you more boldly, brethren, from part as reminding you, by the grace given me by God,
For me to be the, workman of Jesus Christ to the nations, offering in sacrifice the good news of God, that the bringing forward of the nations be acceptable, consecrated in the Holy Spirit.
I have therefore boasting in Christ Jesus the things toward God.
For I shall dare to speak nothing that Christ has not brought about by me, for the obedience of the nations, by word and by work,
By power of signs and wonders, by power of the Spirit of God, so that I from Jerusalem, and round about even to Illyricum, have completed the good news of Christ.
And so seeking the honour to announce the good news, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon a strange foundation:
But as has been written, to whom it was not announced of him, they shall see: and they who have not heard shall understand.
Wherefore also I was hindered in many things from coming to you.
And now having no more place in these climes, and having an anxious desire to come to you from many years.
Whenever I go into Spain, I will come to you, for I hope passing through to see you: and by you to be sent forward there, if first from part I might be filled with you.
And now I go to Jerusalem serving the holy ones.
For Macedonia and Achaia were contented a certain mutual participation be made for the poor of the holy ones in Jerusalem.
For they were contented; and they are their debtors. For if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve them in things pertaining to the flesh.
Therefore having completed this, and sealed to them this fruit, I will come away by you to Spain.
And I know that, coming to you, I shall come in the completion of the praise of the good news of Christ.
And I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by love of the Spirit, to fight together with me in prayers for me to God;
That I might be saved from the unbelieving in Judea; and that my service for Jerusalem be acceptable to the holy ones;
That in joy I might come to you by the will of God, and rest with you.
And the God of peace with you all. Amen.
And I place with you Phebe our sister, being servant of the church in Cenchrea:
That ye receive her in the Lord, worthy of the holy ones, and encourage her in whatever thing she have need of you: for she also has been the rule of many, and of myself.
Embrace Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
Who for my soul have laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the nations.
And the church in their house. Embrace my beloved Epenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.
Embrace Mary, who wearied for us.
Embrace Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are distinguished among the sent, who also have been in Christ before me.
Embrace ye Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
Embrace Urban, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.
Embrace Apelles acceptable in Christ. Embrace them of Aristobulus.
Embrace Herodion my kinsman. Embrace them of Narcissus, them being in the Lord.
Embrace Tryphen a and Tryphosa, wearied in the Lord. Embrace Persis the beloved, who was much wearied in the Lord.
Embrace Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Embrace Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren with them.
Embrace Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them.
Embrace one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ embrace you.
And I beseech you, brethren, to observe narrowly them having made divisions and scandals against the teaching which ye learned; and bend away from them.
For such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by specious language and praise completely deceive the hearts of the innocent.
For your obedience has come to all. Therefore I rejoice for you: and I wish you truly to be wise to good, and pure to evil.
And the God of peace will rub together Satan under your feet swiftly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you.
Timotheus my helper, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, embrace you.
I Tertius embrace you, having written the epistle in the Lord.
Gains my guest, and of the whole church, embraces you. Erastus steward of the city embraces you, and Quartus the brother.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
And to him being able to support you according to my good news, and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept silent from eternal times,
And now made manifest, also by the prophetic writings according to the command of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith made known to all nations:
To the only wise God, by Jesus Christ, to whom glory forever. Amen.
Paul, called, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,
To the church of God being in Corinth, to the consecrated in Christ Jesus, to the Called holy ones, with all calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I return thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus;
That in every thing we were enriched in him, in all the word, and all knowledge;
As the testimony of Jesus Christ was made firm in you:
So that ye are not wanting in any grace; awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Who also shall make you firm even to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God faithful, by whom we were called to the communion of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
And I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same, and there be no divisions in you; and ye be set in order in the same mind and in the same knowledge.
For it was manifested to me concerning you, my brethren, by them of Chloe, that there are contentions with you.
And this I say, that each of you says, I truly am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you? or in Paul's name were ye immersed.
I thank God that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;
Lest any should say that in my name I have immersed.
And I immersed also the house of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I immersed any other.
For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to announce good news: not in wisdom of word, lest the cross of Christ be made void.
For truly the word of the cross to them perishing is foolishness; but to us saved it is the power of God.
For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and put away the understanding of the intelligent.
Where the wise? where the scribe? where the seekers together of this life has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was contented by the foolishness of proclaiming to save them believing.
And since the Jews ask a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:
And we proclaim Christ crucified, to the Jews truly a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;
And to these the called, to both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and wisdom of God.
For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men; and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.
For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not, many well born:
But the foolish things of the world, has God chosen that he might shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen that he might shame things strong;
And the ignoble things of the world, and the despised things, has God chosen, and things not being, that the things being he might leave unemployed:
That no flesh might boast before him.
And ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and also justice, and consecration, and holiness:
That, as it has been written, Let him boasting, boast in the Lord.
And I having come to you, brethren, came not with eminence of word or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.
For I judged not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much tremor, was with you.
And my word and my proclaiming not in persuasible words of man's wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and of power.
That your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
But we speak wisdom among the perfected: and the wisdom not of this life, nor of the rulers of this life, they being left unemployed:
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, hidden, which God determined beforehand, before the times to our glory:
Which none of the rulers of this world knew: for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as has been written. Which the eye saw not, and the ear heard not, and upon the heart of man it came not up, what things God has prepared for them loving him.
And God has revealed to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, and the deep things of God.
For who of men knows the things of men except the spirit of man in him? so also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.
And we have not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit from God; that we might know things bestowed upon us as a gift by God.
Which also we speak, not in words taught of man's wisdom, but in them taught of the Holy Spirit; examining spiritual things by spiritual.
And the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot know, for they are spiritually examined.
And the spiritual truly examines all things, and he is examined by no one.
For who knew the mind of the Lord, who shall instruct him And we have the mind of Christ.
And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal, as babes in Christ.
I have given you milk to drink, and not food; for ye were not able, but neither now are ye yet able.
For yet are ye carnal: for wherefore envy in you, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?
For when a certain one should say, I truly am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
Who then is Paul, and who Apollos, but servants by whom ye believed, and to each as the Lord gave?
I have planted, Apollos watered; but God increased.
So that neither he planting is anything, neither he watering; but God increasing.
And he planting and he watering are one: and each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.
For we are workers together with God: the agriculture of God, ye are the building of God.
According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise chief-architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon. And let each see how he builds upon.
For none is able to lay another foundation above that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.
And if any one build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stalks;
The work of each shall be manifested: for the day shall manifest, for in fire it is revealed; and the work of each, what sort it is, the fire shall prove.
If the work of any shall remain which he built upon, he shall receive a reward.
If the work of any one shall be burned, he shall be caused damage: and he shall be saved; and so as by fire.
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwells in you?
If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.
Let none completely deceive himself. If any think to be wise in this life, let him be foolish, that he may he wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it has been written, He seizing the wise in their deceptions.
And again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.
Therefore let none boast in men. For all things are yours;
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or about to be; all are yours;
And ye of Christ; and Christ of God.
So let a man reckon us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
And besides it is sought in stewards, that any one be found faithful.
And to me it is the least that I be judged by you, or by man's day: but neither do I judge myself.
For I know nothing by myself; but in this I have not been justified: and he examining me is the Lord.
Therefore judge ye nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who also, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of hearts: and then shall praise be to each from God.
And these things, brethren, I transformed to myself and to Apollos for you; that ye might learn in us not to think above what has been written, lest ye be puffed up one above one against the other.
For who distinguishes thee? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? and if thou also didst receive, why dost thou boast, as not having received?
Already were ye satisfied, already were ye rich, without us ye reigned; and I would ye also reigned, that we also might reign together with you.
For I think that God has exhibited us the last sent, as exposed to death; for we were a theatre to the world, and to messengers, and to men.
We foolish for Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we weak, and ye strong; ye honourable, and we dishonoured.
Until this present hour we also hunger, and thirst, and we are naked, and are cuffed, and are unsteady.
And we are wearied, working with our own hands: being reviled, we praise; being driven out, we hold up.
Being defamed, we entreat: as the filth of the world were we become, the offscouring of all until now.
Not shaming you, write I these, but as my beloved children I admonish you.
For if ye have ten thousand preceptors in Christ, but not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus by the good news I begat you.
I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
Therefore sent I Timotheus to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of all my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in all the churches.
And as my not coming to you, some were puffed up.
And I will come to you swiftly, if the Lord will, and I shall know not the word of those puffed up, but the power.
For the kingdom of God not in word, but in power.
What will ye? should I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his father's wife.
And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.
For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?
Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:
Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.
I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.
And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.
For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.
And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.
Dare any of you, having an affair with another, be judged by the unjust, and not by the holy ones?
Know ye not that the holy ones shall judge the world? and if the world be judged by you, are ye unworthy of the least judgments?
Know ye not that we shall judge messengers? also not only things pertaining to the cares of life?
Therefore truly, if ye have judgments pertaining to the cares of life, set them counted as nothing in the church.
For confusion I speak to you. So is there not one wise with you, who will be able to judge between his brother?
But brother with brother is judged, and this by the unbelieving.
Therefore truly, already is there wholly a misfortune in you, that ye have judgments with yourselves. Wherefore had ye not rather be treated ill? wherefore had ye not rather be defrauded?
But ye treat ill, and defraud, and that the brethren.
Or know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be ye not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,
Nor thieves; nor covetous, nor intoxicated, nor railers, nor rapacious, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
And these were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were consecrated, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all are lawful to me, but I will not be exercised by power under any.
Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: and God will also leave unemployed this and them. And the body not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
And God also raised up the Lord, and us will he also raise up by his power.
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? having taken the members of Christ, shall I make members of a harlot? It may not be.
Or know ye not that he joined to a harlot is one body? for they shall be, he says, they two into one flesh.
And he joined to the Lord is one spirit.
Flee fornication. Every sin which if a man do is without the body; but he committing fornication sins against his own body.
Or know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?
For ye were bought for a price: then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.
And of what ye wrote to me: good for a man not to touch a woman.
And, on account of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.
Let the husband return to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.
The wife of her own body has not power, but the husband: and likewise also the husband of his own body has not power, but the wife.
Deprive ye not one another, except somewhat of an agreement for a time, that ye might have leisure for fasting and prayer; and again upon the same ye might come together, lest Satan tempt you for your want of self command.
And this I say according to indulgence, not according to order.
For I will all men to be as also myself. But each has his own favor of God, the one truly thus, and the other thus.
And I say to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain also as I.
And if they have not self command, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to be set on fire.
And to the married I announce, (not I, but the Lord,) The wife not to be separated from the husband:
And if also she be separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to the husband: and the husband not to send away the wife.
And to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she assents to dwell with him, let him not send her away.
And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he assents to dwell with her, let her not send him away.
For the unbelieving husband was consecrated in the wife, and the unbelieving wife was consecrated in the husband: for then are our children unclean; and now are they holy.
And if the unbelieving is separated, let him be separated. A brother or a sister has not been reduced to slavery in such things as these: and God has called us in peace.
For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save the husband or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save the wife?
Except as God divided to each, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.
Whoever was called circumcised? let him not be drawn to himself. Whoever was called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commands of God.
Each in the calling which he was called, in this let him remain.
A servant wert thou called? let it not concern thee: for if thou art able to be free, rather make use of it.
For the servant called in the Lord, is the freedman of the Lord: likewise also the freedman called, is the servant of Christ.
Ye were bought for a price; be ye not servants of men.
Each, in what he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.
But for virgins I have not an order of the Lord: and I give an opinion as compassionated by the Lord to be faithful.
I think therefore this to be good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be thus.
Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not a release. Hast thou been loosed from a wife seek thou not a wife.
And if also thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. And such shall have pressure to the flesh: and I spare you.
And this I say, brethren, the time is restricted; as to the rest, that they also having wives should be as not having;
And they weeping, as not weeping; and they rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and they buying, as not possessing.
And they using this world, as not using; for the form of this world passes away.
But I will you to be free from care. The unmarried cares for things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:
And he married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.
The wife and virgin have been divided. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy also in body and spirit: and she married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.
And this I say for the advantage of yourselves; not that I shall cast a net upon you, but for the becoming, and occupied assiduously for the Lord without being turned away.
And if any think to act unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she be past the vigor of youth, and so it ought to be, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.
And he who has stood firmly fixed in heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.
So that he marrying does well; and he not marrying does better.
The woman was bound by law for as much time as her husband lives; and if her husband be set to sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
And she is happier if she so remain, according to my opinion: and I also think to have the Spirit of God.
And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.
And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.
And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)
Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.
For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)
But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.
But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.
And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.
And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.
For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idol's temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;
And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?
And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.
Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.
Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.
If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.
My justification to them examining me is this,
have we not power to eat and to drink?
Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?
Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?
Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?
For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?
Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.
If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?
If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.
Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?
Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.
But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.
For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news!
For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.
For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.
And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;
To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,
I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.
And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.
Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.
And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.
I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:
But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.
And I will not ye be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
And were all immersed into Moses in the cloud, and in the sea;
And they all ate the same spiritual food.
And all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual Rock following; and the Rock was Christ.
But God was not contented with the most of them: for they were overthrown in the desert.
And these things were our types, that we be not eagerly desirous of evil things, as they also eagerly desired.
Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
Neither should we commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.
Neither should we tempt Christ, as also some of them tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.
Neither do ye murmur, as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
And all those happened types to them; and it was written for our reminding, to whom the ends of the times have arrived.
Therefore let him seeming to stand see that he fall not.
No temptation except human has taken you and God faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but with the temptation will he also make an escape, that ye may be able to bear.
Wherefore, my beloved, do ye flee from idolatry.
As to the wise speak I; judge ye what I say.
The cup of praise which we praise, is it not the mutual participation of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the mutual participation of the body of Christ?
That, one bread, one body, we are many: for we all partake of one bread.
See ye Israel according to the flesh: are not they eating the sacrifices mutual participators of the altar?
What do I say therefore? that an idol is any thing? or that what is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?
But, that what things they sacrifice the nations sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I will not ye be partakers of demons.
Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.
Do we emulate the Lord? are we stronger than he?
All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all things are lawful to me, but all build not the house.
Let none seek his own, but each another's.
Every thing being sold in the market, eat, ye, interrogating nothing through consciousness:
For of the Lord the earth, and its fulness.
And if any one of the unbelieving call you, and ye wish to go; every thing set before you, eat, interrogating nothing through consciousness.
And if any one say to you, This is sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for him making it known, and consciousness: for of the Lord the earth, and its fulness:
And consciousness, I say, not thine, but another's: for that why is my freedom judged by another's consciousness.
And if I partake by grace, why am I defamed for what I give thanks?
Whether therefore ye eat, whether ye drink, or what ye do, do ye all things to the glory of God.
And be ye not molesters to the Jews, and the Greeks, and to the church of God:
As I also please in all things to all, not seeking my advantage, but that of many, that they might be saved.
Be ye imitators of me, as I also of Christ.
And I approve you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and as I have delivered to you, do ye hold the traditions.
And I will you to know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman the man; and the head of Christ God.
Every man praying or prophesying, having on the head, shames his head.
And every woman praying or prophesying with head uncovered shames her head: for it is one and the same to her having been shaved.
For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: and if shameful to the woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
For truly the man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God: and the woman is the glory of the man.
For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
For also the man was not created through the woman; but the woman through the man.
Therefore the woman ought to have power upon the head for the angels.
But neither the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
For as the woman by the man, so also the man by the woman; and all things of God.
Judge in yourselves: is it suitable for a woman to pray to God uncovered?
Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man truly have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?
And if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for the hair has been given her for a cloak.
And if any one seem to be loving strife, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
And this announcing I approve not, that not for the better come ye together, but for the worse.
For truly first, ye coming together in the church, I hear divisions to be among you; and some part I believe.
For there must be also sects among you, that the tried might be made manifest among you.
Therefore ye coming together upon the same, it is not to eat the Lord's supper.
For each takes his own supper in eating: and one is truly hungry, and one is intoxicated.
For, have ye not houses for eating and drinking? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them not having? What should I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise not.
For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, in the night which he was delivered up, took bread:
And having given thanks, he brake, and said, Take ye, eat; this is my body, broken for you: this do ye for my remembrance.
Likewise the cup also, after supping, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink, for my remembrance.
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye announce the Lord's death till he come.
Therefore whoever should eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be liable to the penalty of the body and blood of the Lord.
And let a man try himself, and so eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
For he eating and drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
For this many among you weak and sick, and enough are asleep.
For if we examined ourselves, we should not be judged.
And being judged, we are corrected of the Lord, lest we be condemned with the world.
Therefore, my brethren, coming together to eat, succeed one another.
And if any hunger, let him eat in the house; lest ye come together for judgment. And the rest when I come I will regulate.
And concerning spiritual things, brethren, I wish you not to be ignorant.
Ye know that ye were the nations, to dumb idols, as ye were led, being carried away.
Wherefore I make known to you, that none speaking in the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema: and none can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.
And there are distinctions of favors, and the same Spirit.
And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord.
And there are distinctions of performances, and it is the same God performing all things in all.
And to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.
For truly to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
And to another faith in the same Spirit; and to another graces of healings in the same Spirit;
And to another performances of powers; and to another discriminations of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:
And all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each his own things as be will.
For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, is one body: so also is Christ.
For also in one Spirit were we all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or free; and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.
For also the body is not one member, but many.
If the foot say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.
And if the ear say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.
If the whole body an eye, where the hearing If the whole hearing, where the smelling?
And now has God set the members each one of them in the body, as he would.
And if all were one member, where the body.
And now truly many members, and one body.
The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
But much rather the members of the body, seeming to be weak, are necessary:
And what we think to be less honourable of the body, upon these we put more abundant honour; and our unseemly parts have more abundant decorum.
And our becoming parts have no need: but God blended the body together, to the wanting having given more abundant honour:
That no division be in the body; but the members should care the same for one another.
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer together; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.
And ye are the body of Christ, and members by parts.
And whom truly God set in the church, first the sent, second the prophets, third teachers, then powers, then graces of healings, helps, directions, kinds of tongues.
Not all sent: not all prophets: not all teachers: not all powers:
All have not the favors of healing: not all speaking with tongues: not all interpret accurately.
And be emulous of the better favors: and yet I shew you a way according to eminence.
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.
And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.
And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.
Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,
It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;
Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;
Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.
Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.
For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.
And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.
When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.
For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.
And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.
Pursue love, and be emulous of spiritual things, and rather that ye might prophesy.
For he speaking in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God: (for none hears; and in the spirit he speaks mysteries.)
And he prophesying speaks to men for building the house, and entreaty, and encouragement.
And he speaking in a tongue builds himself; and he prophesying builds the church.
And I will ye all to speak with tongues, and rather that ye prophesy; for greater he prophesying, than he speaking with tongues, unless he interpret accurately, that the church receive building up.
And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
As inanimate things giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it give not a distinction to sounds, how shall the piping or harping be known?
For also if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?
So also ye, except by the tongue ye give an evident word, how shall the speaking be known? for ye shall be speaking into the air.
If perchance, such kind of voices be in the world, and none of them speechless.
If therefore I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him speaking a foreigner, and he speaking a foreigner to me.
So also ye, since ye are zealous of spirits, for the building up of the church seek that ye may abound.
Wherefore he speaking in a tongue, let, him pray that he might interpret.
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, and my mind is unfruitful.
What therefore is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind: I will play on the harp in the spirit, and I will play also on the harp in the mind.
When if thou praise in the spirit, how shall he filling the place of the private individual say Amen at thy thanksgiving) since he knows not what thou sayest.
For thou truly givest thanks well, but the other is not built up.
I thank my God, speaking in tongues more than you all:
But in the church, I will to speak five words by my mind, that I might also sound in the ears of others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
Brethren, be not children in reflection: but in wickedness act like children, and in reflection be ye perfected.
It has been written in the law, That in other tongues and in other lips will I speak to this people; and not so will they hear me, says the Lord.
So that tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving: and the gift of prophecy, not to the unbelieving, but to the believing.
If therefore the whole church come together upon the same, and all speak with tongues, and the private individual, or unbelieving, come in, will they not say that ye are enraged?
And If all prophesy, and any unbelieving, or ignorant private individual come in, he is refuted by all, he is examined by all:
And so the hidden things of his heart are made manifest; and so having fallen upon the face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly with you.
Therefore, what is it brethren when ye come together, every one of you has a Psalms, has teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretatior. Let all things be for the building of the house.
Whether any speak in a tongue, by two, or the most by three, and in part; and let one interpret.
And if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
And let the prophets speak two or three, and let others decide.
And if to another sitting by it be revealed, let the first be silent.
For ye are all able to prophesy one by one, that all might learn, and all might be encouraged.
And the spirits of the prophets are subjected to the prophets.
For God is not of unsteadiness, but of peace, as in all the churches of the holy ones.
Let your women be silent in the churches: for it has not been committed to them to speak; but to be subjected, as also says the law.
And if they will learn anything, let them ask their own husbands in the house; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.
Or came out the word of God from you or did it arrive to you only?
If any think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him observe what I write to you, that they are the commands of the Lord.
And if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and hinder not to speak in tongues.
Let all things be becomingly and according to order.
And I make known to you, brethren, the good news which I announced to you, which also ye received, and in which ye stood;
By which also ye are saved, to which word I announced to you if ye hold, unless ye believed to no purpose.
For I delivered to you among the first, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the writings;
And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the writings.
And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:
Then was he seen by above five hundred brethren once for all; of whom the most remain till now, and some also are laid to rest.
Then was he seen by James; then by all the sent.
And last of all exactly as an abortive, was he also seen by me.
For I am the least of the sent, who am not fit to be called sent, for I drove out the church of God.
And by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which in me was not vain; but I was more abundantly wearied than they all: and not I, but the grace of God which with me.
Whether therefore I or they, so we proclaim, and so ye believed.
And if Christ is proclaimed that he arose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no rising up of the dead?
And if there is no rising up of the dead, neither has Christ risen:
And if Christ has not risen, then our proclaiming vain, and also your faith vain.
And we are also found false witnesses of God; for we testified for God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if therefore the dead are not raised.
For if the dead are not raised, neither was Christ raised up:
And if Christ was not raised up, your faith is vain; yet are ye in your sins.
Then they also having died in Christ perished.
If in this life only we have been hoping in Christ, we are more to be compassionated than all men.
And now Was Christ raised from the dead, he was the first fruits of those having died.
For since by man death, also by man the rising up of the dead.
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
And each in his own order: the first fruit Christ; then they of Christ in his arrival.
Then the end, when he should deliver up the kingdom to God, and the Father; when he should leave unemployed every beginning and every authority and power.
For he must reign, till he put all enemies under his feet.
The last enemy, death, is left unemployed.
For he subjected all things under his feet. And when he said that all things have been subjected, it is manifest that without him having subjected all things to him.
And when all things be subjected to him, then also shall the Son himself be subjected to him having made all things subject to him, that God might be all things in all.
For what shall they do being immersed for the dead, if in fine the dead rise not? and why are they immersed for the dead?
And why are we in peril every hour?
In the day I die by: your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
If according to man I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what the profit to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
Be not deceived: evil intercourses corrupt good habits.
Recover your senses rightly, and in not; for some have a want of knowledge of God: I speak to your confusion.
But some one will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
Froth, what thou sowest is not made alive, except it die:
And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body going to be, but the naked kernel, if perhaps of wheat, or some of the rest:
And God gives it a body as he would, and to each of the seed its own body.
Not all flesh the same flesh: but one truly flesh of men, and another of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of flying things.
And celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but truly one the glory of the celestial, and another that of the terrestrial.
One glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differs from star in glory.
So also the rising up of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
It is sown an animated body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animated body, and there is a spiritual body.
So also has been written, The first man Adam was born into a living soul; and the last Adam into a spirit making alive.
But the first not spiritual, but animated; then the spiritual.
The first man of earth, made of earth: the second man the Lord from heaven.
As the made of earth, such also the made of earth: and as the celestial, such also the celestial.
And as we have borne the image of the made of earth, we shall also bear the image of the celestial.
And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
Behold, I speak to you a mystery; We truly shall not all be laid asleep, but we shall all be changed,
In an atom, in the twinkling of the eye, in the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this corrupted must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.
And when this corrupted shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be the word written, Death was swallowed down in victory.
Where thine, death, the sting? where thine, hades, the victory.
And the sting of death sin; and the power of sin the law.
And grace to God, giving us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stable, unmoved, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that our fatigue is not in vain in the Lord.
And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.
According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.
And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.
And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.
And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.
For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.
And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.
For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.
And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.
Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.
And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.
Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.
Let all things be in love.
And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)
That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.
And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.
For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.
The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.
All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.
The greeting of Paul by my hand.
If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:
My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God being in Corinth, with all holy ones being in the whole of Achaia:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and God of all comfort:
Who comforting us upon all our pressure, that we may be able to comfort them in every pressure, by the comfort by which we ourselves are comforted by God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so by Christ abounds also our comfort.
And whether we are pressed, for your comfort and salvation, being well wrought in endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer: whether we are comforted, for your comfort and salvation.
And our hope firm for you, knowing, that as ye are participators of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.
For we wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of our pressure having been to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly loaded, above strength, so that we were in utter perplexity even to live:
And we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have trusted in ourselves, but in God raising the dead:
Who saved us from so great a death, and does save: in whom we have hoped also that he will yet save;
And ye serving together for us in prayer, that of many faces, the favor to us by many thanks be returned by us.
For our boasting is this, the testimony of our consciousness, that in simplicity and purity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we turned back in the world, and more eminently to you.
For we write no others to you, but what ye either know or also observe; and I hope that also even to the end ye will observe;
As also ye observed us by part, that we are your boast, as also ye ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
And in this confidence I wished to come to you before, that ye might have a second grace;
And by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia, to come to you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.
Therefore I resolved this, much less did I use levity: or what I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that there be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay.
And God faithful, for our word to you was not yea or nay.
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who proclaimed in you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but was yea in him.
Forasmuch as the solemn promises of God in him yea, and in him Amen, for glory to God by us.
And he making us firm with you in Christ, and having anointed us, is God;
Who also having sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.
And I call upon God a witness upon my soul, that, sparing you, I came no more to Corinth.
Not that we are masters of your faith, but we are aiders of your joy: for ye have stood in the faith.
And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.
For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.
And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.
For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.
And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.
Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.
So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.
Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.
For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.
And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;
That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.
And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,
I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.
Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.
For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:
Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?
For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.
Begin we again to recommend ourselves or need we not, as some; recommendatory epistles to you, or recommendatory from you?
Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and acknowledged by all men:
Made manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables made of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.
And we have such confidence through Christ to God:
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency of God;
Who rendered as fitting servants of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, and the Spirit makes alive.
And if the service of death, in letters imprinted in stones, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently to the face of Moses for the glory of his face; being left unemployed.
How shall not rather the service of the Spirit be in glory?
For if the service of condemnation glory, much more the service of justice abounds in glory.
For also that having been glorified has not been glorified in this part, for sake of the glory excelling.
For if that left unemployed by glory, much more that remaining in glory.
Therefore having such hope, we use much freedom of speech:
And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not look intently to the end of that left unemployed:
But their minds were hardened: for until this day the same veil upon the reading of the old covenant remains not uncovered; for in Christ it is left unemployed.
But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.
And whenever it turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
And the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord, there freedom.
And we all, shown as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, with the face uncovered, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Spirit of the Lord.
For this, having this service, as we were compassionated, we lose not courage;
But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craft, neither adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every consciousness of man before God.
And if also our good news is hid, in the lost is it hid:
In whom the God of this world blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the enlightening of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, does not enlighten them.
For we proclaim not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus.
For God, having spoken light to shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts, to the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the eminence of power be of God, and not of us.
Being pressed in every thing, but not straightened; being at a loss, but not utterly perplexed;
Being driven out, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;
Always bearing about in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our body.
For we, the living, are always delivered to death for Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
So that death is truly energetic in us, and life in you.
And having the same spirit of faith, according to that written, I believed, therefore I spake: and we believe, and therefore we speak;
Knowing that he having raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us by Jesus, and present us with you.
For all things for you, that grace, having abounded by the many, might abound in thanksgiving to the glory of God.
Wherefore we lose not courage; but if also our man without is destroyed, but he within is renewed day and day.
For the present moment the lightness of our pressure works to us an eternal weight of glory, as eminence upon eminence;
We looking not at things seen, but at things not seen: for things seen, temporary; and things not seen, eternal.
For we know that if our earthly house of the tent were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
For also in this we groan, longing to have our dwelling from heaven put on:
If also being even clothed we shall not be found naked.
For also being in the tent we groan, being loaded: since we wish not to be unclothed, but to be clothed, that the mortal should be swallowed up of life.
And he having brought us about to this same, God, he having also given us the pledge of the Spirit.
Therefore being always confident, and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
(For we walk by faith, and not by external appearance:)
And we are confident, and are contented rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home in the Lord.
Wherefore also let us seek the honour, whether being at home, whether being absent, to be pleasing to him.
For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ; that each might receive the things for the body, for what he did, good or bad.
Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are made manifest to God; and I hope also to have been made manifest to your consciences.
For not again do we recommend ourselves to you, but giving you occasion for boasting over us, that ye might have for them boasting in face, and not in heart.
For whether we be beside ourselves, to God: or be of sound mind, to you.
For the love of Christ holds us together; having judged this, that if one died for all, then all dead:
And he died for all, that the living no more live to themselves, but o him having died for them, and having risen.
So that we from now know none according to the flesh: and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know no more.
So that if any in Christ, a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all have become new.
And all things of God, having reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given us the service of reconciliation;
For as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their faults; and having set in us the word of reconciliation.
For Christ therefore are we ambassadors, as of God beseeching by us: we pray for the sake of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.
For him not knowing sin, he made sin for us; that we might be the justice of God in him.
And working together, we also beseech, lest also ye receive the grace of God in vain.
(For he says, In an acceptable time I listened to thee, and in the day of salvation have I run to succor thee: behold, now the acceptable time; behold; now the day of salvation.)
Giving no offence in any thing, that the service be not blamed:
But in every thing recommending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in pressures, in necessities, in extremities,
In blows, in imprisonments, in disorders, in fatigues, in watchings, in fastings;
In purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned.
In the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of justice of the right hands and the left,
Through glory and ignominy, through slander and applause: as erring, and true;
As being ignorant, and knowing; as dying, and, behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not killed;
As being grieved, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
Our month stands open to you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.
Ye are not contracted in us, but ye are contracted in your bowels.
And for the same recompense, (I speak as to children,) be ye yourselves also enlarged.
Be not unequally yoked together with the unbelieving: for what participation to justice and iniquity and what communion to light with darkness?
And what conformity to Christ with Belial? and what part to the believing with the unbelieving?
And what agreement to the temple of God with images? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God said, That I will dwell in them, and will go round about; and will be their God, and they shall be a people to me.
Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you.
And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
Therefore having these declarations, dearly let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Receive us; we injured none, we corrupted none, we took advantage of none.
I speak not to condemnation: for I have said before, ye are in our hearts to die together, and live together.
Much freedom of speech to me toward you; to me much boasting over you: I am filled with consolation, I superabound in joy in all your pressure.
For also, we having come to Macedonia, our flesh had no relaxation, but pressed in everything; without conflicts, within fears.
But God, comforting the humble, comforted us in the arrival of Titus;
And not only in his arrival, but also in the comfort which he was comforted in you, announcing to us your anxious desire, your lamentations, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.
For if I also grieved you in the epistle, I regret not, and if I did regret: for I see that that epistle, if also for a time, grieved you.
Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved to repentance: for ye were grieved according to God, that ye be injured in nothing by us.
For grief according to God works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but grief of the world works death.
For behold, this same that ye grieve according to God, what care it wrought in you, but defence, but indignation, but fear, but anxious desire, but zeal, but punishing! In every thing ye recommended yourselves to be holy in this affair.
Wherefore, if I also wrote to you, not for him having been unjust, for him having suffered injustice, but that your care for us might be made manifest to you before God.
Therefore have we been comforted in your comfort: and we rejoiced more abundantly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed from you all.
For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I was not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also was our boasting over Titus the truth.
And his bowels are more abundantly to you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and tremor ye received him.
I rejoice that I place confidence in you in everything.
And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia;
That in much proof of pressure the abundance of their joy and their poverty according to depth abounded to the abundance of their simplicity.
For according to power, I testify, and above power chosen voluntarily;
Praying us with much entreaty that we receive the grace and participation of the service for saints.
And not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.
So that we besought Titus, that as he began before, so also he would complete to us this grace also.
But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all care, and in love from you to us, that also ye abound in this grace.
I speak not according to command, but by care of others, trying also the purity of your love.
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for you he was in a state of beggary, being rich; that ye in his poverty might be rich.
And in this I give an opinion: for this is profitable to you, which no only to do, but to will, ye began before from last year.
And now also complete ye the doing; that as a forwardness to will so also to complete, out of what is possessed.
For if a forwardness lie before, according as any has, it is acceptable, not as he has not.
For not that ease to others, and pressure to you:
But of equality, now in this time your abundance for their want, that also their abundance be for your want: that there be equality:
As has been written, He to whom much, was not in excess; and he to whom little, was not diminished.
And grace to God, having given the same care for you in the heart of Titus.
For truly he received the entreaty; and being more earnest, he went forth voluntarily to you.
And we sent with him the brother whose approbation in the good news through all the churches;
And not only, but also the hand stretched out by the churches for our fellow-traveler with this grace, served by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to your forwardness:
Prepared for this, lest any blame us in this abundance served by us:
Providing good things beforehand, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
And we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things being earnest many times, and now much more earnest, with much confidence in you.
Whether for Titus, my companion and co-worker to you: or our brethren, the sent of the churches, the glory of Christ.
Therefore the manifestations of your love, and of your boasting for us, shew ye to them, and to the face of the churches.
For truly, concerning the service to the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
For I know your forwardness, which I boast of for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from last year; and zeal from you excited the many more.
And I sent the brethren, lest our boasting for you be empty in this part; that, as I said, ye might be prepared:
Lest if in some way the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, (that we should not say, ye) in this principle of boasting.
Therefore I thought necessary to beseech the brethren that they go before to you, and prepare beforehand your praise, having been proclaimed beforehand, this same to be prepared, so as praise, and not as covetousness.
And this, He sowing sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he sowing in praises shall reap also in praises.
Each as he chooses in the heart; not of grief, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God able for all grace to abound in you; having always all sufficiency in everything, ye abound in every good work:
(As has been written, He scattered; he gave to the poor: his justice remains forever.
And now he furnishing seed to him sowing, and bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing-season, and increase the fruits of your justice;)
Enriched in everything in all simplicity, which works through us gratitude to God.
For the service of this office is not only filling up the wants of the saints, but also abounding through many thanks to God;
By the proof of this service honouring God for the subjection of your assent to the good news of Christ, and to the simplicity of mutual participation to them and to all;
And by their prayer for you, longing for you through the exceeding grace of God upon you.
And grace to God for his indescribable gift.
And I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and equity of Christ, who, in face truly low with you, but at a distance bold towards you:
And I pray, being present, not to be bold with the confidence which I reckon to encounter against certain, reckoning us as walking about according to the flesh.
For walking in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:
(For the weapons of our warfare not fleshly, but powerful to God to the taking down of fortified places;)
Taking down reckonings, and every elevation lifted up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;
And having in readiness to avenge every imperfect instruction, when your obedience should be completed.
See ye things according to the face? If any has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him reckon this again of himself, that, as he of Christ, so we also of Christ.
For if I also boast something more abundantly of our power, which the Lord gave us for the building up, and not for your taking down, I shall not be ashamed:
Lest I seem as terrifying you by epistles.
(For truly the epistles, he says, weighty and strong; but the presence of the body weak, and the word counted as nothing.)
Let such a one reckon this, that, such as we are in the word by the epistles, being away, such also, being present, in deed.
For we dare not appear or join ourselves to certain of them recommending themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and joining themselves to themselves, do not understand.
And we boast not of things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure divided to us, to reach even also to you.
For not as reaching to you we stretch beyond ourselves: for also even to you we came before in the good news of Christ:
Not boasting in things immeasurable, in the toils of others; and having hope, your faith being increased, to be enlarged in you according to our rule for abundance,
To announce the good hews in things beyond you, not in another's rule to boast for things prepared.
But he boasting, let him boast in the Lord.
For not he recommending himself, this is acceptable, but whom the Lord recommends.
I would ye hold me up a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.
For I am zealous of you with the zeal of God: for I fitted you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.
And I am afraid lest, as the serpent completely deceived Eve in his craft, so your thoughts be corrupted from the simplicity which in Christ.
For if he coming proclaim another Jesus, which I proclaimed not, or ye receive another spirit, which ye received not, or other good news, which ye received not, ye have held up well.
For I reckon myself to be nothing greatly inferior to the sent.
And, if also ignorant in the word, but not in knowledge; but in every thing, we having been made manifest in all for you.
Or did I a sin, humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I announced to you the good news of God gratuitously?
I stripped other churches, having received pay, for your service.
And being present with you, and having wanted, I acted not with negligence to any: (for the brethren having come from Macedonia filled up still more my want:) and I kept myself in every thing not burdensome to you, and I will keep.
The truth of Christ is in me, for this boasting shall not be shut up in me in the regions of Achaia.
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knows.
And what I do, and I will do, that I shall not cut off the occasion of those wishing the occasion; that in what they boast, they be found as also we.
For such the falsely sent, crafty workers, being transformed into the sent of Christ.
And not wonderful; for Satan himself is transformed into a messenger of light.
No great thing therefore if also his servants are transformed as servants of justice; whose end shall be according to their works.
Again I say, lest any one should think me to be mad; and if not so indeed, as mad do ye receive me that I might also boast myself some little.
What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in madness, in this first principle of boasting.
Since many boast according to the flesh, I shall also boast.
For ye bear with the mad willingly, being wise.
For ye bear, if any reduce you to bondage, if any devour, if any receive, if any be lifted up, if any skin you on the face.
I speak according to dishonour, as that we were weak. And in what any dares, (I speak in rashness,) I dare also.
Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they Abraham's seed? I also.
Are they Christ's servants? (I speak being light-headed) I above; in toils more abundant, in blows more excessively, in watchings more abundantly, in deaths often.
Of the Jews five times I received forty, except one.
Thrice was I scourged with rods, once was I stoned, thrice suffered I shipwreck, I have made a night and day in the deep;
In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers of the family, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in solitude, in dangers in the sea, in dangers with false brethren;
In fatigue and toil, in watchfulnesses often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
Besides things outside, my distraction daily, the care of all the churches.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I am not inflamed.
If I must boast, I will boast things of my weakness.
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, he being praised forever, that I lie not.
In Damascus king Aretas' governor watched the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me.
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and I escaped from his hands.
Indeed it is not profitable to me to boast. For I will come to visions and Revelation of the Lord.
I knew a man in Christ before fourteen years, (whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;) such a one having been carried off even to the third heaven.
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;)
That he was carried off into paradise, and heard words not to be told, which it was not permitted man to speak.
Of such a one will I boast: and of myself I will not boast, except in my weakness.
For if I be willing to boast, I shall not be mad; for the truth will I say: and I spare, lest any reckon for me above what he sees me, or what he hears of me.
And lest I be lifted up by the eminence of Revelation, a thorn in the flesh was given me, a messenger of Satan, that he might cuff me, lest I be lifted up.
For this thrice besought I the Lord, that it remove away from me.
And he said to me, My grace suffices thee: for my power is perfected in weakness. Therefore very willingly will I boast rather in my weaknesses, that Christ's power may lodge upon me.
Therefore am I contented in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities in expulsions, in extremities for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
I have been mad boasting; ye forced me: for I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was not greatly inferior to the sent, if also I am nothing.
Surely the signs of one sent was wrought in you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and powers.
For what is it which ye were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself acted not with negligence to you? favor me for this injustice.
Behold, I have prepared to come to you the third time; and I will not act with negligence to you: for I seek not your things, but you: for children ought not to treasure up for parents, but parents for children.
And I very willingly will expend and be expended for your souls; if also loving you more abundantly, the less I should be loved.
And "let it be, I overloaded you not: but being dexterous, I took you by contrivance.
Not any of whom I have sent to you have I by him taken advantage of you.
I called for Titus, and sent with a brother. Has Titus taken advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? not in the same steps?
Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? before God in Christ we speak: and all things, beloved, for your building up.
For I am afraid, lest somehow, having come, I find you not such; as I will, and I find you such as ye wish not: lest somehow, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intrigues, calumnies, whisperings, inflations, derangements:
Lest, coming again, my God should humble me with you, and I shall mourn for many of them having sinned before, and not having repented for uncleanness, and fornication, and licentiousness which they committed.
This third I come to you. By mouth of two witnesses, and three, shall every word be established.
I have said before, and say beforehand, as being present the second; and being away now I write to them having sinned before, and to all the rest, that, if I should come again, I will not spare:
Since seek proof of Christ speaking in me, who to you is no weak, but has power in you.
For also if he was crucified from weakness, but he lives from the power of God. For also we are weak in him, but we live with him from the power of God to you.
Try yourselves, if ye are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless ye are not tried?
And I hope that ye shall know that we are not untried.
And I pray to God that ye do nothing evil; not that we appear tried, but that ye do good, and we be as untried.
For we are not able anything against the truth, but for the truth.
For we rejoice when we be weak, and ye be able: and this also we pray, your restoration.
For this I write these things being absent, that being present I should not wound severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.
As to the rest, brethren, rejoice. Be adjusted, be comforted, think the same, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall with you.
Greet ye one another in a holy kiss.
All the holy ones greet you.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit with you all. Amen.
Paul, sent, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, having raised him from the dead;)
And with me all the brethren, to the churches of Galatia:
Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
Having given himself for our sins, that he might take us away out of this present evil time, according to the will of God and our Father:
To whom the glory for the time of times. Amen.
I wonder that so quickly are ye transferred from him having called you by the grace of Christ to another good news:
Which is not another; except some are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.
But also if we, or a messenger from heaven, announce good news to you, more than what: we have announced to you, let him be anathema.
As we said before, also now say I again, If any announce to you good news above what ye received, let him be anathema.
For now do I persuade men, or God? or seek I to please men? for if I had yet pleased men, I should not have been the servant of Christ.
But I make known to you, brethren, the good news announced by me that it is not according to man.
For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
For ye heard of my turning about when in Judaism, that in excess I drove out the church of God, and laid it waste:
And I advanced in Judaism above many like in my race, being more abundantly zealous of paternal traditions.
And when God was contented, having separated me from my mother's womb, and having called me, by his grace,
To reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him the good news in the nations; I consulted not with flesh and blood:
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them sent before me; but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.
Then after three years I came up to Jerusalem to examine Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.
And other of the sect I saw not, except James the Lord's brother.
And what I write to you, behold, before God, that I lie not.
Then came I to the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea there in Christ.
And only they had heard, That he then driving us out, now announces the good news, the faith which he then felt the absence of.
And they glorified God in me.
Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.
And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.
But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:
And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:
To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.
And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not man's face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:
But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;
(For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)
And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.
Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.
And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.
For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.
And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?
We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,
Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.
For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.
For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.
I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.
I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.
O Unwise Galatians, who has cast a spell upon you, not to obey the truth, to whom before the eyes Jesus Christ was written beforehand, crucified in you?
This only wish I to learn from you, Received ye the Spirit from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?
Are ye so unwise? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now completed in the flesh?
Suffered ye so many things in vain? if yet also in vain.
He therefore furnishing you the Spirit, and working the powers in you, is it from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?
As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.
Know ye therefore that they of faith, these are sons of Abraham.
And the writing, foreseeing that of faith God justifies the nations, announced beforehand the good news to Abraham, That in thee shall all nations be praised.
So that they of faith are praised with faithful Abraham.
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it has been written, Cursed every one who remains not in all written in the book of the law to do them.
And that none is justified in the law before God, is manifest: for, The just shall live of faith.
And the law is not of faith: but, The man having done them shall live in them.
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been a curse for us: for it has been written, Cursed every one hanging upon a tree:
That the praise of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Brethren, I speak according to man; Although a man's covenant, having been confirmed, none annuls, or orders an addition.
And to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as to many; but as to one: And to thy seed, who is Christ.
And I say this, the covenant confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, having been after four hundred and thirty years, does not annul, to neglect the promise.
For if of the law the inheritance, no more of promise: and God has favored Abraham by promise.
What then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the seed come to whom it was promised;) appointed by angels in the hand of a mediator.
And a mediator is not of one, and God is one.
The law then against the promises of God? It may not be: for if a law had been given able to make alive, truly justice would be by the law.
But the writing shut up all things under sin, that the promise from faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believing.
And before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to faith about to be revealed.
So that the law was our preceptor towards Christ, that we might be justified from faith.
And faith having come, we are no more under a preceptor.
For we are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither servant nor free, there is neither male and female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if ye of Christ, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;
But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the world's elements:
And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.
But then truly, not having known God, ye were in a servile condition to them not being gods by nature.
And now, having known God, and rather known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and poor elements, to which again ye wish anew to be in a servile condition.
Ye observe narrowly days, and months, and times, and years.
I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.
Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.
And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.
And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.
What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.
Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.
They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.
And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.
My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,
And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.
Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.
But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.
Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.
For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.
But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.
For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.
And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.
But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.
But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.
Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.
Therefore in the liberty which Christ has freed us, stand ye, and be not again held in the yoke of servitude.
Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
And again to any man circumcised, I testify, that he is debtor to do the whole law.
Ye were neglected from Christ, whoever are justified in the law; ye have fallen from grace.
For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of justice.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision; but faith being energetic through love.
Ye were running well; who hindered you not to obey the truth?
The confidence not from him calling you.
A little leaven leavens the whole mixture.
I have trusted to you in the Lord, that ye will have nothing different in mind; and he troubling you shall bear judgment, whoever he be.
And I, brethren, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I. yet driven out? therefore the offence of the cross is left unemployed.
I would also they shall be cut off who having risen up against you.
For ye were called to liberty brethren; only not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve ye one another.
For all the law is completed in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
And if ye bite and devour one another, see ye that ye be not laid waste by one another.
And I say, Walk in Spirit, and complete not the desire of the flesh.
For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are adverse to one another: that not the things ye would, these should ye do.
And if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,
Idolatry, charm, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intriguings, seditions, sects.
Envyings, slaughters, drunkenness, revelries, and the like: to these which I foretell you, as I have also said before, that they doing such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
Meekness, temperance: against such is no law.
And they of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and desires.
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.
Bear one another's burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:
For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.
For each shall bear his own load.
Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.
For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.
And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.
Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.
See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.
As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.
For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.
And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.
And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the holy ones being in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
Praised be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, he having praised us in every spiritual praise in heavenly things in Christ:
As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, for us to be holy and blameless before him in love:
Having determined us beforehand for adoption as a son by Jesus Christ to him, according to benevolence of his will,
To the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he rendered us acceptable in the beloved.
In whom we have redemption by his blood, the letting go of faults, according to the riches of his grace;
In which he abounded to us in all wisdom and intelligence;
Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his benevolence which he purposed in himself:
For the arrangement of the completion of the times, to unite in a whole all things in Christ, both the things in the heavens, and the things upon earth; in him:
In whom also we were cast by lot, determined beforehand according to the purpose of him performing all things according to the counsel of his will:
For us to be to the praise of his glory, who before hoped in Christ.
In whom ye also, having heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation: in whom also having believed, ye were sealed by the holy Spirit of solemn promise,
Which is the pledge of our inheritance for the redemption of the acquisition, to the praise of his glory.
For this, I also, having heard the faith among you in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the holy,
Cease not returning thanks for you, making remembrance of you in my prayers;
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, might give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in his knowledge:
The eyes of your understanding enlightened; for you to know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the holy ones,
And what the surpassing greatness of his power to us believing, according to the action of the might of his strength,
Which he performed in Christ, having raised him from the dead, and he sat on his right hand in the heavenlies,
Above every beginning, and authority, and power, and property, and every name named, not only in this life, but in that about to be:
And placed all things under his, feet, and gave him head over all things to the church,
Which is his body, the completion of him completing all things in all.
And ye being dead in faults and in sins;
In which when ye walked according to the life of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, of the spirit now energetic in the sons of disobedience:
Among whom also we then all occupied ourselves in the eager desire? of our flesh, doing the wills of the flesh and the thoughts; and were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.
But God, being rich in mercy, by his much love which he loved us,
And we being dead in faults, he made alive together with Christ, (by grace are ye saved;)
And raised together, and seated together in heavenlies in Christ Jesus:
That he might show in times coming the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and this not of you: the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any one should boast.
For we are his work, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
Wherefore remember, that ye then the nations in the flesh, being reckoned Uncircumcision by the Circumcision in the flesh reckoned made by hands;
That ye were in that time without Christ alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners from the covenants of solemn promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
And now in Christ Jesus ye who then being far off have become near in the blood of Christ.
For he is our peace, having made both one, and having loosed the middle partition wall of the enclosure;
The enmity in his flesh, the law of commands in enactments, having left unemployed; that he might create in himself one new man, making peace;
And that he might reconcile anew both in one body to God by the cross, having slain the enmity in it:
And having come, he announced good news, peace to you afar off, and to those near.
For by him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
Wherefore then are ye no more foreigners and sojourners, but fellow citizens of the holy, and the household of God;
Built upon the foundation of the sent, and of the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone;
In whom all the building fitted together increases into a holy temple in the Lord:
In whom also ye are builded together for the dwelling of God in the Spirit.
For this, I Paul, the imprisoned of Christ Jesus for you the nations,
If ye have heard of the distribution of the grace of God given to me for you:
That by revelation he made Known to me the mystery; (as I before wrote briefly,
By which ye, reading, can perceive My understanding in the mystery of Christ,)
Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as now has been revealed to his holy sent and to the prophets by the Spirit:
For the nations to be co-heirs, and united in one body, and, participators of his solemn promise in Christ by the good news:
Of which I Became a servant, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me according to the energy of his power.
To me, the least of all the holy ones, was this grace given, to announce the good news in the nations, the untraceable riches of Christ.
And to enlighten all what the distribution of the mystery, concealed from times immemorial in God, having created all things by Jesus Christ:
That it might now be made known to beginnings and powers in the heavenlies by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
According to the purpose of times immemorial which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:
In whom we have freedom of speech and access with confidence by his faith.
Wherefore I desire not to lose courage in my pressures for you, which is your glory.
For this I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Of whom all the family in the heavens and upon earth is named,
That he might give to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the interior man;
For Christ to dwell by faith in your hearts; in love being rendered firm, and the foundation laid,
That ye might be fully able to comprehend with all the holy what the length, and breadth, and depth, and height;
To know also the love of Christ, surpassing knowledge, that ye might be filled in all the fulness of God.
And to him being able to do above all things more abundantly above what we ask or think, according to the power being energetic in us,
To him the glory in the church in Christ Jesus to all generations of the times of times. Amen.
Therefore I, the imprisoned in the Lord, beseech you to walk Worthy of the calling which ye were called,
With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love;
Striving earnestly to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
One body, and one Spirit, as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;
One Lord, one faith, one immersion,
One God and Father of all, who over all, and through all, and in you all.
And to each one of us was grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Wherefore he says, Having ascended into height, he made captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.
(And so having ascended, what is it except that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
He having descended is the same having ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill up all things.)
And truly he gave the sent; and the prophets; and the bearers of good tidings; and the shepherds, and the teachers;
For the adjusting of the holy, for the work of the service, for the building up of the body of Christ:
Until we all arrive to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to the perfect man, to the measure of age of the filling up of Christ.
That we be no more babes, tossed about, and carried around by every wind of doctrine, in the playing at dice of men, in craft, with the artifice of deceit;
And speaking the truth in love, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, Christ:
From whom all the body fitted together and joined together by every touch of the expenditure, according to the energy in measure of one of each part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.
Therefore this I say, and testify in the Lord, that ye no more walk as also the rest of the nations, in the vanity of their mind,
Being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God by ignorance being in them, by the hardness of their heart;
Who no longer having had feeling delivered themselves to licentiousness, to the work of all uncleanness in overreaching.
And ye have not so learned Christ;
If ye heard him, and were taught in him, as is the truth in Jesus:
For you to put away according to the former mode of life the old man, corrupted according to the eager desires of deceit;
And to be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
And to put on the new man, created according to God in justice and sanctity of truth.
Wherefore falsehood ye having put away, speak the truth each with his neighbor: for ye are members one of another.
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your fit of anger:
Neither give place to the accuser.
He stealing let him steal no more: and rather let him be wearied from fatigue, working good with the hands, that he have to impart to him having need.
Let not any foul word go out of your mouth, but if any good to the building of necessity, that it might give grace to them hearing.
And grieve ye not the Holy Spirit of God in which ye were sealed to the day of redemption.
Let all harshness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and slander, be put away from you, with all badness:
And be ye kind one to another, having good bowels, favoring each other, as also God in Christ Jesus favored you.
Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dearly beloved children;
And walk ye in love, as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us a gift and sacrifice to God for a smell of sweet odor.
And fornication, and all uncleanness, or overreaching, let it not be named with you, as becomes the holy;
And obscenity, and silly discourse, or wit, which things concern not; but rather thankfulness.
For this ye are knowing, that every fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let none lead you astray with vain words: for by these things comes the anger of God upon the sons of disobedience.
Be ye not therefore partakers with them.
For ye were then darkness, and now light in the Lord: walk ye as children of light:
(For the fruit of the Spirit in all goodness and justice and truth;)
Trying what is pleasing to the Lord.
And participate not with the unfruitful works of darkness, and rather also confute.
For the things done secretly by them it is also shameful to speak.
And all things refuted, by light are made manifest: for everything made manifest is light.
Wherefore he says, Awake, who sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten thee.
See therefore how ye walk accurately, not as unwise, but as wise,
Making purchase of time, for the days are evil.
For this be not foolish, but understanding what the will of the Lord.
And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;
Speaking to yourselves on harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, singing and playing on the harp in your heart to the Lord;
Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father;
Yielding obedience to one another in the fear of God.
Women, yield ye obedience to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
But as the church is subjected to Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.
Husbands, love your own wives, as also Christ loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;
That he might consecrate it, having cleansed by the washing of water in the word,
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it be holy and blameless.
So ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He loving his wife, loves himself.
For none at any time hates his own flesh; but brings it up and cherishes it, as also the Lord the church:
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
For this a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
This is a great mystery: but I speak to Christ and to the church.
But ye also altogether, let each so love his own wife as himself: and the wife that she fear her husband.
Children, listen to your parents in the Lord: for this is just.
Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first command with solemn promise;)
That it may be well to thee, and thou mayest be long time upon earth.
And, fathers, be not angry with your children: but bring them up in the instruction and reminding of the Lord.
Servants, listen to lords according to the flesh, with fear and tremor, in simplicity of your heart, as to Christ;
Not with eye-service, as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul:
With affection serving the Lord, and not men.
Knowing that whatever good each might do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a servant or free.
And, lords, do ye the same things to them, letting go threatening: knowing that also your own Lord is in the heavens; and distinction of persons is not with him.
As to the rest, my brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the strength of his power.
Put on the complete armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the artifices of the accuser.
For the wrestling is not to us against blood and flesh, but against beginnings, against powers, against the chiefs of the world of darkness of this life, against spiritual things of wickedness in heavenly things.
For this take up the complete armor of God, that ye might be able to withstand in the evil day, and having effected all things, to stand.
Stand therefore, having girded your loins around with truth, and put on the armor of justice;
And fastened under the feet in preparation of the good news of peace;
Over all, having taken the shield of faith, in which ye shall be able to quench all the inflamed darts of evil.
And take ye the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
By all prayer and supplication praying in all time in Spirit, and for this same watching vigilantly in all perseverance and supplication for the holy:
And for me, that the word might be given me, in the opening of my mouth in freedom of speech, to make known the mystery of the good news,
For which I am an ambassador in perplexity: that in it I might speak freely, as I ought to speak.
And that ye also might know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus will make all things known to you, the dearly beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord:
Whom I sent to you for this same, that ye might know the things concerning us, and he might comfort your hearts.
Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace with all loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibleness. Amen.
Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I return thanks to my God for all your remembrance,
Always in all my prayer for you all with joy making prayer,
For your mutual participation in the good news from the first day until now;
Confident of this same, that he having begun a good work in you will complete till the day of Jesus Christ:
As it is just for me to think this concerning you all, for my having you in the heart; both in my bonds, and in the justification and confirmation of the good news, ye all being partakers of grace with me.
For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
And this I prey, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all intelligence;
For you to try things differing; that ye may be pure and not stumbling to the day of Christ;
Filled with the fruits of justice, by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me have rather gone to the advancement of the good news;
So that my bonds in Christ were manifest in the whole pretorium, and to all the rest;
And many of the brethren in the Lord, having trusted to my bonds, more abundantly dared to speak the word fearlessly.
And some truly by envy and strife, and some also by kindness of disposition, proclaim Christ.
Some truly of hired labor announce Christ, not purely, thinking to bring pressure upon my bonds:
And some of love, knowing that I am placed for justification of the good news:
For what? but in any manner, whether in pretence, or truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, and certainly I will rejoice.
For I know that this shall be turned to me for salvation by your prayer, and the furnishing more of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
According to my anxious expectation, and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but in all freedom of speech, as always, and now shall Christ be Magnified in my body, whether by life, whether by death.
For me to live is Christ, and to die gain.
And if to live in the flesh, this to me the fruit of work: and whether I shall be taken away I know not.
For I am pressed together from two, having one eager desire to be loosed, and be with Christ (rather much better:)
And to tarry yet longer in the flesh is more necessary for you.
And confident in this, I know that I shall remain, and shall remain near together with you all for your advancement and joy of faith:
That your boasting may abound in Jesus Christ in me, for my coming again to you.
Only live as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ: that whether coming and seeing you, whether being absent, I shall bear the things concerning you, that ye stand in one spirit, one soul, fighting together in faith of the good news;
And terrified in nothing by them being hostile to you: which to them is truly an indication of destruction, and to you of salvation, and this from God.
For upon you was it conferred as a favor for Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him;
Having the same struggle which ye saw in me, and now hear in me.
If therefore any consolation in Christ, if any encouragement of love, if any mutual participation of the Spirit, if any compassions and mercies,
Fill ye up my joy, that ye may have the same in mind, having the same love, unanimous, being one in mind.
Nothing by hired labor, or vainglory; but in lowliness the leaders hold each other above themselves.
Look ye each not on the things of themselves, but also each the things of others.
For let this be in mind among you, which also in Christ Jesus;
Who, being in the form of God, thought not robbery to be equal to God.
But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, born in the likeness of men:
And found in fashion as man, he humbled himself, being obedient until death, and the death of the cross.
Wherefore God has also exceedingly exalted him, and favored him as a gift with a name above every name:
That in the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of the heavenlies, and of terrestrial things, and things under earth
And every tongue should avow that the Lord is Jesus Christ, to the glory of the Father.
Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always listened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and tremor effect your own salvation.
For God is working in you also to will and to work by benevolence.
Do ye all things without murmurings and discussions:
That ye be complete and pure, children of God, blameless in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom ye appear as luminaries in the world;
Holding on to the word of life; for boasting to me in the day of Christ, for I ran not in vain, nor was I wearied in vain.
But if also I am poured out upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice together with you all.
And do ye also rejoice at the same, and rejoice together with me.
And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy quickly to you, that I also be courageous, having known the things concerning you.
For I have none having a like soul, who naturally will have care for the things concerning you.
For they all seek the things of themselves, and not the things of Christ Jesus.
And ye know his proof, that, as a child to a father, he served with me in the good news.
Him therefore I truly hope to send, whenever I shall see from it the things concerning me.
And I have trusted in the Lord that I myself also shall come quickly.
And I thought necessary Epaphroditus, my brother, and cooperator, and fellow-soldier, and your sent, and workman of my necessity, be sent to you.
Since he was longing for you all, and harassed because ye heard that he was sick.
For also he was sick near to death: but God compassionated him; and not him only, but also me, lest I should have grief upon grief.
Therefore I sent him the more earnestly, that, seeing him, ye might again rejoice, and I be more free from sorrow.
Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy; and hold such esteemed.
Because for the work of Christ he drew near to death, having exposed the soul to danger, that he might fill up your want of service to me.
As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me is not slothful, and to you safe.
Look out for dogs, look out for evil workmen, look out for the incision.
For we are the circumcision, serving God in spirit, and boasting in Christ Jesus, and not trusting in the flesh.
Although I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other think to have confidence in the flesh, I more:
Circumcision done the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
For zeal, driving out the church; for justice in the law, not to be found fault with.
But what things were gain to me, these I have thought loss for Christ.
But surely, I also think all things to be loss for the superiority of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have been made to lose all things, and I think to be offscourings, that I shall gain Christ,
And be found in him, not having my justice, that of the law, but that by faith of Christ, the justice from God by faith:
To know him, and the power of his rising up, and the mutual participation of his sufferings, being rendered conformable to his death;
If somehow I shall arrive at the rising up of the dead.
Not that I have already attained or have been already perfected: and I pursue, if I also may overtake, for which also I was overtaken by Christ Jesus.
Brethren, I reckon not myself to have been overtaken: but one, truly forgetting things behind, and stretching still farther to things before,
I pursue toward the scope for the prize of combat of the calling above of God in Christ Jesus.
Therefore, as many as are completed, let us have this in mind; and if in any thing ye think otherwise, God will also reveal this to you.
But, at what we before arrived, to walk by the same rule, to think the same.
Be ye imitators together of me, brethren, and observe narrowly those walking thus, as ye have us for a type.
(For many walk, of whom I said to you often, and now also say weeping, the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Whose end destruction, whose God the belly, and their glory in shame, having in mind earthly things.)
For our citizenship is in the heavens; from whence we also expect the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Who will change the body of our humiliation, for it to be conformable to the body of his glory, according to the operation by which he is able to place all things under himself.
Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand ye in the Lord, dearly beloved.
I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same in the Lord.
And I also ask thee, worthy yoke fellow, aid those women who fought in company with me in the good news, and with Clement, and the rest of my co-workers, whose names in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always: again say I, Do ye rejoice.
Let your fitness be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Rave anxiety about nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with gratitude let your desires be made known to God.
And the peace of God, surpassing all understanding, shall watch your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
As to the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever venerable, whatever just, whatever pure, whatever lovely, whatever prosperous; if any ability, and if any praise, reckon up these things.
And what things ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace shall be with you.
And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that once already ye recovered new vigor; for thinking of me, upon whom ye were thinking, and ye had not time.
Not that I speak concerning want; for I have learned, among whom I am, to be satisfied with my condition.
And I know how to be humble, and I know how to abound in every thing: and in all I am instructed also to be full and to hunger, and to abound and to be in want.
I am strong for all things in Christ strengthening me.
But ye did well, participating together in my pressure.
And ye also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I went out from Macedonia, no church participated with me in the word of donation and accepting, except ye alone.
For also in Thessalonica, and once, and twice, ye sent to my necessity.
Not that I covet a gift: but I covet fruit abounding to your word.
And I have all, and abound: I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a smell of sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.
And God will fill up all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
And to God and our Father the glory for the times of times. Amen.
Greet ye every one holy in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me greet you.
All the holy greet you, and chiefly they from Caesar's house.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy the brother,
To the holy among the Colossians, and the faithful brethren in Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We return thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and love to all the holy,
By the hope laid up for you in the heavens, which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the good news;
Being present to you as also in all the world; and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day which ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth:
As also ye learned from Epaphras our beloved fellowservant, who is a faithful servant of Christ for you;
He also having manifested to us your love in the Spirit.
For this also we, from the day which we heard, ceased not praying for you, and asking that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
For you to walk worthy of the Lord in all pleasing behavior, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
In all power being able according to the strength of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy.
Returning thanks to the Father, having rendered us fitting for the portion of the lot of the holy in light:
Who saved us from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of his love:
In whom we have redemption by his blood, the remission of sins:
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation:
For by him were all things created, things in the heavens, and things upon earth, things visible and invisible, whether thrones, whether dominions, whether beginnings, whether authorities: all were created by him, and for him:
And he is before all, and all things have been established by him.
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that he might be the first in all.
For in him was he pleased that all fulness should dwell:
And by him to reconcile all things anew to himself; having made peace by the blood of his cross, by him, whether things upon earth, whether things in the heavens.
And you, once being alienated and enemies in mind by evil works, and now has he reconciled.
In the body of his flesh by death, to present you holy, and blameless, and irreproachable before him:
If indeed ye remain in the faith, founded and firmly fixed, and not moved aside from the hope of the good news, which ye heard, being proclaimed in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was a servant;
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill again the necessities of the pressures of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the church.
Of which I was a servant, according to the stewardship of God, given to me for you, to complete the word of God;
The mystery hid from times immemorial, and from generations, and now has been manifested to his holy ones:
To whom God would make known what the riches of the glory of this mystery in the nations; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
Whom we announce, reminding every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfected in Christ Jesus:
For which also I am wearied, struggling according to his operation, working in me in power.
For I wish you to know how great contest I have for you, and them in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
That their hearts might be comforted, being joined together in love, and to all the riches of the complete certainty of the understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and the Father, and of Christ;
In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
And this I say, lest any mislead you with persuasive arguments.
For if also I am away in the flesh but in the Spirit am I with you, rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
Therefore as ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him:
Being rooted and built up in him, and rendered firm in the faith, as ye were taught, abounding in it with gratitude.
See ye lest any be carrying you off by philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.
For in him dwells all the completion of divinity bodily.
And ye are completed in him, who is the head of all beginning and power:
In whom also were ye circumcised with the circumcision not made by hands, in the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ;
Buried together with him in immersion, in which also were ye risen together by the faith of the operation of God, having raised him from the dead.
And you, being dead in faults and uncircumcision of the flesh, he made alive together with him, having propitiated to you all faults;
Having wiped out the handwriting against us in enactments, which was opposed to us, and he has taken it from the midst, having nailed it to his cross.
Having stripped off beginnings and powers, he made an example in freedom of speech, having led them in triumph in it.
Therefore let not any judge you in food, or in drink, or in turn of festival, or of the new moon, or of sabbaths:
Which are a shadow of things about to be; and the body of Christ.
Let none condemn you being willing in humility and religious worship of angels, going into what he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,
And not having power over the Head, from whom all the body, by all the senses of touch and connections furnished and joined together, increases with the increase of God.
If therefore ye died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do ye dogmatize,
(Touch not; neither taste; neither shouldest thou handle;
Which are all for corruption in the using;) according to the commands and doctrines of men?
Which things truly are having the word of wisdom in worship according to one's will, and humility, and prodigality of the body; not in any honour to satisfying the flesh.
If therefore ye be risen with Christ, seek things above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God.
Think of things above, and not upon those upon the earth.
For ye died, and your life has been hid with Christ in God.
When Christ shall be manifested, our life, then also ye with him shall be made manifest in glory.
Therefore kill your members that are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
For these comes the Wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:
In which also ye then walked, when ye lived in them.
And now ye also put them all away; anger, wrath, badness, slander, shameful language out of your mouth.
Lie not to one another, having put off the old man with big deeds;
And having put on the new, being renewed in knowledge according to the image of him having created him:
Where no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, free: but Christ all things, and in all.
Put on therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassions, kindnesses, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
(Bearing one another, propitiating one another, if any have a complaint against any: as also Christ propitiated for you, so also ye.)
And over all these, love, which is the bond of completion.
And let the peace of God act as umpire in your hearts, to which also, ye were called in one body: and be grateful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in, you richly; teaching and reminding one another in all wisdom, playing with harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, with grace singing in your hearts to the Lord.
And all whatever you do in word and in work, all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
Women, place yourselves under your own husbands, as was permitted in the Lord.
Men, love ye the wives, and be not embittered against them.
Children, listen to parents in all things: for this is pleasing to the Lord.
Fathers, irritate not your children, lest they be discouraged.
Servants, listen ye in all things to lords according to the flesh; not in eyeservice as pleasing men; but in simplicity of heart, fearing God:
And all, whatever ye do, work ye from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men;
Knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
And he acting with injustice shall be taken care of for what he did unjustly: and there is no distinction of persons.
Lords, render ye to servants Justice and equality; knowing that ye also have a Lord in the heavens.
In prayer persevere, watching in it in gratitude.
Praying together also for us, that God would open to us a door of the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, by which also I was bound;
That I might manifest, as is fitting for me to speak.
In wisdom walk toward them without, purchasing the time.
Your word always in grace, Seasoned with salt, to know how it is fitting for you to answer one another.
All things concerning me shall Tychicus make known to you, a dearly beloved brother, and a faithful servant and fellowservant in the Lord:
Whom I sent to you for this same, that he might know the things concerning you, and comfort your hearts;
With Onesimus, the faithful and dearly beloved brother, who is of you. They shall make known to you all the thing here.
Aristarchus my fellowcaptive greets you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (for whom ye received commands: if he come to you, receive him;)
And Jesus, called Justus, they being of the circumcision. These only fellow workers in the kingdom of God, which were a consolation to me.
Epaphras, who of you, greets you, a servant of Christ, always contending for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfected and completed in all the will of God.
For I bear testimony to him, that he has much zeal for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
Luke, the dearly beloved physician, greets you, and Demas.
Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
And when the epistle shall be read among you, make that also it be read to the church in Laodicea; and that ye also read that from Laodicea.
And say to Archippus, Look out for the service which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fill it.
The greeting of Paul by my hand. Remember my bonds. Grace with you. Amen.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We return thanks to God always for you all, making remembrance of you in our prayers continually;
Remembering your work of faith, and fatigue of love, and patience of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God and our Father;
Knowing, brethren beloved, of God your selection.
For our good news was not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much complete certainty; as we know what we were among you for your sake.
And ye were imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much pressure, with joy of the Holy Spirit:
So that ye were types to all believing in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith towards God went out; so that we have no need to speak any thing.
For they themselves proclaim of us what entrance we have to you, and how ye turned to God from images to serve the living and true God;
And to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom be raised from the dead, Jesus, saving us from coming wrath.
For ye yourselves know, brethren, our entrance to you, that it was not in vain:
But also having suffered before, and having been injured, as ye know, among the Philippians, we acted freely in our God to speak to you the good news of God with much contest.
For our entreaty nor from error, nor from uncleanness, nor in deceit:
But as we have been tried by God to be entrusted with the good news, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, trying our hearts:
For neither once in word were we flatterers, as ye know, neither in a pretext of covetousness; God the witness:
Neither seeking glory of men, nor of you, nor of others, being able to be in weight, as the sent of Christ.
But we were gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse should cherish her children:
So longing for you, we are contented to impart to you, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because ye are dearly beloved to us.
For ye remember, brethren, our fatigue and toil: for also working night and day, not to overload any of you, we proclaimed to you the good news of God.
Ye witnesses, and God, how holily and justly and unblamably we were to you the believing:
As ye know how each one of you, as a father his children, comforting and encouraging, and testifying,
For you to walk worthy of God, calling you into his kingdom and glory.
For this also we return thanks to God continually, that, having received the word of God from our report, ye received not the word of man, but as it is truly, the word of God, which is also energetic in you the believing.
For ye, brethren, were imitators of the churches of God being in Judea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things by your own race, as they also by the Jews:
They also having slain the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and having driven you out; and not pleasing God, and opposite to all men;
Hindering us from speaking to the nations that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: and the wrath of God has come before upon them even to the end.
And we, brethren, having been separated from you for a due measure of time, in face, not in heart, we were the more excessively zealous to see your face with much eager desire.
Wherefore we would have come to you, I Paul, truly also once and twice; and the adversary hindered us.
For what our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Are not also ye before our Lord Jesus Christ in his arrival?
For ye are our glory and joy.
Wherefore no more concealing, we were content to be left among the Athenians alone:
And sent Timothy, our brother, and servant of God, and our coworker in the good news of Christ, in order to make you firm, and comfort you for your faith
For none to be shaken in these pressures: for ye yourselves know that for this we are placed.
For also, when we were with you, we told you before that we were about to be pressed; as also it was, and ye know.
For this I also, no more concealing, sent to know your faith, lest some way he tempting have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.
And now Timothy having come to us from you, and having announced to us the good news, your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, greatly desiring to see us, as we also you:
For this, brethren, were we comforted in you in all our pressure, and necessity by your faith:
For now we live, if ye stand in the Lord.
For what thankfulness can we return to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for you before our God;
Night and day praying exceedingly to see your face, and to adjust things wanting of your faith?
And God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you:
And the Lord increase you and make you to abound in love to one another, and to all, as also we to you:
To make your hearts firm, complete in holiness before God, and our Father, in the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his holy ones.
Therefore as to the rest, brethren we ask you, and beseech in the Lord Jesus, as ye received from us how ye must walk and please God, that ye may more abound.
For ye know what orders we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
For this is the will of God, your consecration, that ye should keep away from fornication:
For each of you to know how to possess his vessel in consecration and honour;
Not in the passion of eager desire, as also the nations not knowing God:
Not to pass over and have the advantage over his brother in business: because the Lord just for all these, as we told you before and testified.
But God has not called you to uncleanness, but in consecration.
For surely therefore he despising, despises not man, but God, he also giving his holy Spirit for us.
And for brotherly love ye have no need to write to you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
For also ye do the same to all the brethren, them in the whole of Macedonia: and we beseech you, brethren, to more abound;
And that ye be ambitions to remain quiet, and attend to your own things, and work with your own hands, as we enjoined you;
That ye should walk becomingly to them without, and have need of nothing.
And I wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of them having been asleep, that ye should not grieve, as also the rest, they hating no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose up, so also God by Jesus Christ will bring with him them having slept.
For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that we the living being left at the arrival of the Lord shall not get beforehand with them having slept.
For the Lord himself in the word of command, in the voice of the archangel, shall descend from heaven: and the dead in Christ shall be raised first:
Then we the living being left shall be snatched up together with them in the clouds, to the meeting of the Lord in the air: and so we shall always be with the Lord.
Therefore comfort ye one another with these words.
And of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need to write to you.
For ye yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so comes.
For when they say, Peace and security; then sudden ruin is upon them, as anguish in her with child; and they may not escape.
And ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day as a thief overtake you.
Ye are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.
Therefore let us not sleep, as also the rest; but let us watch and be sober.
For they sleeping sleep in the night; and they drunken are drunken in the night.
And we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on the coat of mail of faith and love; and a helmet, the hope of salvation.
For God set us not for wrath, but for the acquisition of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
He having died for us, that, whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him.
Wherefore comfort one another, and build up one another, as also ye do.
And we ask you, brethren, to know those being fatigued among you, and set over you in the Lord, and reminding you;
And to think them above ordinary in love for their work. Live in peace in yourselves.
And we beseech you, brethren, remind the disorderly, encourage the timid, sustain the weak, and be slow to anger to all.
See that any return not evil to any: but always pursue good to one another, and to all.
Rejoice always.
Pray continually.
In every thing return thanks: for this the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.
Quench not the Spirit.
Set not prophecies at nought.
Try all things; hold the good.
Keep away from all appearance of evil.
And the same God of peace consecrate you perfectly compete; and your whole spirit and soul and body be kept faultless to the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Faithful he calling you, who also will do.
Brethren, pray for us.
Greet all the brethren in a holy kiss.
I bind you by oath, for the epistle to be read to all the holy brethren.
The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you. Amen.
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, for your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all enlarges to one another;
So that we ourselves boast in you in all the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your expulsions and pressures which ye endure:
(A proof of the just judgment of God,) for you to be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
Even though just with God to return pressure to them pressing you;
And to you being pressed a release with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power,
In fire of flame giving vengeance to them not knowing God, and to them not listening to the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Who shall undergo punishment, eternal ruin from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
When he should come to be honoured in his holy ones, and to be admired in all the believing, (that our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
For which also we pray always for you, that our God would deem you worthy of the calling, and fill all the benevolence of goodness, and work of faith in power:
So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be honoured in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
And we ask you, brethren, concerning the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our assembling together to him,
For you not to be quickly shaken in mind, neither be disturbed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle as by us, as that the day of Christ has drawn near.
Let none deceive you in any manner: for, except an apostasy come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
Who being opposed and lifted up above all called God, or which is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.
Remember ye not, that, yet being with you, I spake these to you.
And now ye know the withholding for him to be revealed in his time.
For the mystery of iniquity is already energetic: only he withholding, even till he be out of the midst.
And then shall the Lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the spirit of his mouth, and leave unemployed in the splendor of his arrival:
Whose arrival is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,
And in all deceit of iniquity in the lost; because they received not the love of the truth, for them to be saved.
And for this, God shall send them the energy of error, for them to believe in falsehood:
That all might be judged not believing the truth but contented in iniquity.
And we ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren dearly beloved by the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
To which he called you by our good news, to the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand, and hold firmly the doctrines which ye were taught, whether by the word, or by our epistle.
And our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, also our Father, having loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope in grace,
Comfort your hearts, and support you in every good word and work.
As to the rest, pray, brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be honoured, as also with you:
And that we may be delivered from unfit and evil men: for not faith of all.
But the Lord is faithful, who supports you, and will watch from the evil.
And we have had confidence in the Lord for you, that what we announce to you, and ye do and will do.
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.
And we proclaim to you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to shrink from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the doctrine which he received of us.
For ye yourselves know that ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;
Neither ate we the bread of any as a gift; but in fatigue and toil working night and day also, not to overload any of you:
Not that we have not power, but that we give ourselves a type to you to imitate us.
For also when we were with you, this we proclaimed to you, that if any will not work, neither should he eat.
For we hear some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but occupied unprofitably.
And to such we proclaim and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, with freedom from care working, they should eat their own bread.
And ye, brethren, lose not courage doing good.
And if any listen not to our word by the epistle, mark him, and mix not together with him, that he may change.
And deem not as an enemy, but remind as a brother.
And the Lord of peace himself give to you peace for all in every manner. The Lord with you all.
The greeting of Paul with my hand, which is the sign in every epistle: so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ according to the command of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, our hope;
To Timothy, genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord.
As I besought thee to remain in Ephesus, going into Macedonia, that thou mightest proclaim to some not to teach another doctrine,
Neither hold to fictions and endless genealogies, which offer questions, rather than the arrangement of God in the faith:
(And the end of the proclamation is love out of a pure heart, and a good consciousness, and unfeigned faith:
Which some having missed turned away to vain discourse.
Wishing to be teachers of the law; neither understanding what they say, nor of certain things they are assured.
And we know the law good, if any use it lawfully;
Knowing this, that the law is laid down not for the just one, but for the lawless and disorderly, for the profane and sinful, for the wicked and unholy, for the patricides and matricides, for manslayers,
For fornicators, unchaste, manstealers, liars, the perjured, and if there be any other thing opposed to sound doctrine;
According to the good news of the glory of the blessed God, with which I was entrusted.
And I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, having strengthened me, for he deemed me faithful, having set me in the service;
Being before slandering, expelling, and an abuser: but I was commiserated, because I did, not knowing, in unbelief.
And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance, for Christ Jesus came into the world to save the sinful; of whom I am first.
But for this was I commiserated, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a model to them about to believe on him to eternal life.
And to the King of times, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, honour and glory for the times of times. Amen.)
This proclamation I set before thee, child Timothy, according to the gifts of prophecy led before upon thee, that thou in them mightest war the good warfare;
Having faith, and a good consciousness; which some having rejected concerning faith suffered shipwreck:
Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they should not be taught to blaspheme.
I Beseech therefore, first of all, supplications to be made, prayers, entreaties, thanks, for all men;
For kings, and all them being in eminence; that we may lead a gentle and quiet life, in all devotion and gravity.
For this good and acceptable before our Saviour God;
Who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
For one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
Having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in his own time.
For which I was placed a herald, and the sent, (I speak truth in Christ, I lie not;) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.
I will therefore men shall pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning.
And likewise the women in well arranged simplicity, with modesty and discretion, arrange themselves; not in tresses, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing;
But (what become women professing religious worship) with good works.
Let the woman, in freedom from care, learn in all subjection.
And I trust not the woman to teach, neither to exercise authority over the man, but to be in freedom from care.
For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, was in the transgression.
And she shall be saved through the bringing forth children, if they remain in faith and love and consecration with discretion.
Faithful the word, If any strive for superintendence, he eagerly desires a good work.
Therefore an overseer must be irreprehensible, husband of one wife, sober, of sound mind, well arranged, hospitable, giving instruction;
Not intoxicated, not a quarrelsome person, not occupied in sordid gain; but equitable, without fighting, exempt from avarice;
Presiding well over his own house, having the children in subjection with all gravity;
(And if any know not to preside over his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
Not newly planted, lest rendered proud he fall into condemnation of the accuser.
And he must also have good testimony from them without;lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the accuser.
Deacons likewise grave, not speaking equivocally, not holding to much wine, not occupied in sordid gain;
Having the mystery of faith in pure consciousness.
And let these also first be tried; then let them perform the office of footman, being blameless.
Wives also grave, not accusers, sober, faithful in all things.
Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, presiding well over the children and their own houses.
For they having served well, acquire to themselves a good step, and much freedom of speech in the faith which in Christ Jesus.
These I write to thee, hoping to come to thee quickly:
And if I delay, that thou shouldest know how thou must be occupied in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
And manifestly great is the mystery of devotion: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed in the nations, was believed on in the world, was received up in glory.
And the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall be removed from the faith, holding to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of evil spirits;
In the hypocrisy of speaking falsely; burned with a hot iron in their own consciousness;
Hindering to marry, to keep from victuals which God created for participation, with thanks, for the faithful and them knowing the truth.
For every created thing of God good, and nothing thrown away, received with thanks:
For it is consecrated by the word of God and entreaty.
These having laid down to the brethren, thou shalt be a good servant of Jesus Christ, brought up in the words of faith and good doctrine, which thou hast closely followed.
And profane and old women's fictions reject, and exercise thyself in devotion.
For bodily exercise is profitable, to little: but devotion is profitable to all things, having promise of life now, and that about to be.
Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance.
For, for this also we are wearied and reproached, that we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, chiefly of the faithful.
Proclaim and teach these things.
Let none despise thy youth; but be thou a type of the faithful, in word, in intercourse, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Till I come, hold to reading loud, to entreaty, to doctrine.
Neglect not the power which in thee, which was given thee by the gift of prophecy, with the putting on of hands of the council of elders.
Bestow diligent care upon these things; be in them; that thy progress may be manifest in all things.
Take heed to thyself, and to the doctrine; remain in them: for doing this, and thou shalt save thyself, and them hearing thee.
An elder shouldest thou not reprove, but beseech as a father; the younger as brethren;
The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.
Honour widows, truly widows.
And if any widow have children or descendants, let them learn first to be pious to their own house, and to return recompenses to their progenitors: for this is good and acceptable before God.
And she truly a widow, and forsaken, has hoped in God, and remains in supplications and prayers night and day.
And she living luxuriously is dead, living.
And these things proclaim, that they might be irreprehensible.
And if any for his own, and chiefly for his own household provide not, he has denied the faith, and is worse than the unbelieving.
Let not a widow be chosen less than sixty years, having been wife of one man,
Testified of in good works; if she have brought up children, if she lodged strangers, if she washed the feet of the holy, if she relieved the pressed, if she followed every good work.
And the younger widows reject: for when they conduct themselves arrogantly against Christ, they wish to marry:
Having judgment, for they put away the first faith.
And at the same time also they learn to be idle, going round about the houses; and not only idle, but also indulging in idle talk, and occupied with unnecessary things, speaking things not becoming.
I wish therefore the younger to marry, to bear children, to rule the house, to give no occasion to him opposing for reproach.
For already have some turned aside after Satan.
If any man or woman faithful have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be loaded; that it may relieve the truly widows.
Let the elders having presided well be deemed worthy of double honour, chiefly they being wearied in word and doctrine.
For the writing says, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox grinding. And, The laborer worthy of his hire.
Against an elder receive not an accusation from without, except from two or three witnesses.
Them having sinned rebuke before all, that the rest also have fear.
I call to witness before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the chosen angels, that thou watch these things without preference, doing nothing by bending.
Put hands swiftly upon none, nor participate in others' sins: keep thyself pure.
Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach and thy frequent weaknesses.
Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment; and also to some they follow in the train.
Likewise also the good works of some are manifest; and having these otherwise, it cannot be hid.
Let as many servants as are under the yoke deem their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the doctrines be not defamed.
And let them having faithful masters not despise, for they are brethren; but rather let them serve, because they are faithful and dearly beloved, they having mutually received of the beneficence. These things teach and beseech.
If any teach otherwise, and come not up to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine according to devotion;
He has been proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, of which is envy, strife, slanders, evil conjectures,
Unprofitable occupations of men corrupted in mind, and deprived of the truth, thinking gain to be devotion: be separated from such.
But devotion with contentment is great gain.
For we brought nothing into the world, it is manifest that neither are we able to carry anything out.
And having sustenance and covering, with these let us be contented.
And they wishing to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many eager desires, unwise and hurtful, which sink men into ruin and perdition.
For the root of all evils is the love of money: which some striving for, have been led astray from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many pains.
And thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow justice, devotion, faith, love, patience, meekness.
Contend earnestly the good contest of faith, take hold upon eternal life, into which thou wert also called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
I beseech thee before God, making all things alive, and Christ Jesus, he having witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good confession;
For thee to keep the command spotless, irreprehensible, until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ:
Which the blessed and only sovereign shall show in his own times, the King of those reigning, and Lord of those ruling;
Who only having immortality, inhabiting inaccessible light; which none of men saw, nor can see; to whom honour and might forever. Amen.
To the rich now in this life, proclaim not to be highminded, nor to be hoping upon the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, offering us all things richly for profit;
To do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal, qualified for participation;
Treasuring up to themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold upon eternal life.
O Timothy, watch that which holds firm, turning aside from profane, idle talk, and oppositions of knowledge, bearing a false name:
Which some proclaiming have missed their aim concerning the faith. Grace with thee. Amen.
Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
To Timothy, dearly beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I have grace to God, whom I serve from the forefathers in pure consciousness, as I have continual remembrance concerning thee in my prayers night and day;
Desiring earnestly to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
Receiving the report of unfeigned faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
By which I remind thee of the cause to light up the favor of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
For God gave not to us the spirit of timidity; but of power, and love, and of soundness of mind.
Therefore shouldest thou not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his imprisoned: but partake of afflictions with the good news according to the power of God;
Who having saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,
And now made manifest by the appearance of our Saviour Jesus Christ, having truly left death unemployed, and having brought life and immortality to light by the good news:
To which I was set a herald, and sent, teacher of the nations.
By which cause I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able to watch my deposits to that day.
Hold the model of sound words, which thou didst hear of me, in the faith and love which in Christ Jesus.
Watch the good deposit by the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.
Thou knowest this, that all they dwelling in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for many times he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my perplexity:
But, being in Rome, he sought me very diligently, and found.
(May, the Lord give to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day:) and in how many things he served in Ephesus, thou knowest better.
Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.
And what thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these things lay by for faithful men, who will be sufficient to teach others also.
Thou therefore suffer ill treatment, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
None making war is entangled with the affairs of life: that he may please him having enlisted him.
And also if any contend for a prize, he is not crowned, except he contend for a prize lawfully.
The farmer toiling must first participate in the fruits.
Observe what I say; for may the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.
Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news:
In which I suffer ill treatment, to bonds, as an evil doer; but the word of God has not been bound.
For this I endure all things for the chosen, that they also might attain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
Faithful the word: For if we died together, we shall also live together:
If we endure, we shall also reign together: if we deny, he will also deny us:
If we believe not, he remains faithful: he cannot deny himself.
Put these things in mind, calling to witness before the Lord not to wrangle for nothing useful, to the subversion of them hearing.
Be earnest to present thyself acceptable to God, a worker without shame, dividing rightly the word of truth.
And avoid profane, empty discourses: for they will proceed to more of profanation.
And this word as a gangrene, will have an eating ulcer: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;
Who concerning the truth missed their aim, saying the rising up has already been; and they subvert the faith of some.
Truly the firm foundation of God has stood, having this seal, The Lord knows them being his. And, Let every one naming the name of Christ remove from iniquity.
And in a great house there is not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen; and some truly for honour, and some for dishonour.
If therefore any cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, consecrated, and useful for the master, prepared for every good work.
And flee youthful, eager desires: and follow justice, faith, love, peace, with them calling upon the Lord from a pure heart.
And silly and ignorant questions refuse, knowing that they produce strifes.
And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all, giving instruction, enduring evil,
In meekness instructing them being in a contrary state; lest perhaps God may give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth;
That they may return to a state of sobriety from the snare of the devil, being taken alive by him at his will.
And this know, that in the last days difficult times shall interpose.
For men shall be self-lovers, lovers of money, boastful, proud, slandering, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked,
Devoid of natural affection, not observing treaties, accusers, ungoverned, wild, not loving the good,
Traitors, rash, haughty, devoted to pleasure more than loving God;
Having a form of devotion, and having denied its power: and these renounce.
For of these are they going into houses, and taking captive little women heaped up with sins, led away with various eager desires,
Always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these have withstood the truth: men corrupted in mind, not tried concerning the faith.
But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also was.
And thou hast closely followed my doctrine, mode of life, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, patience,
Expulsions, sufferings, which were to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what expulsions I endured: and the Lord delivered me from all.
And all wishing to live devotedly in Christ Jesus shall be driven out.
And evil men and impostors shall proceed to worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
And remain thou in what things thou hast learned and hast been convinced of, knowing of whom thou hast learned;
And that from infancy thou hast known the holy letters, able to render thee wise to salvation by faith which in Christ Jesus.
All writing divinely inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for refutation, for correction, for instruction in justice:
That the man of God might be perfect, finished for every good work.
I call to witness before God there fore, and the Lord Jesus Christ, being about to judge the living and the dead according to his appearance and his kingdom;
Proclaim the word; keep fixed seasonably, and unseasonably; refute, censure, beseech, in all longsuffering and teaching.
For the time will be when they will not hear sound doctrine; but according to their own eager desires they will heap up to themselves teachers, feeling itchings for a report;
And truly from the truth will they turn away the hearing, and be turned aside to fictions.
And thou be sober in all things, suffer ill treatment, do the work of the bearer of good news, render thy service perfectly certain.
For I am already poured out, and the time of my deliverance has been fixed.
I have contended earnestly the good contest, I have completed the course, I have kept the faith:
As to the rest, the crown of justice is laid up for me, which the Lord will assign to me in that day, the just judge: and not only to me, but also to all them having loved his appearance.
Be earnest to come to me quickly.
For Demas has forsaken me, having loved the time now, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
Luke alone is with me. Having taken Mark, bring with thyself: for he is useful for the service.
And Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring, and the books, chiefly the parchments.
Alexander the coppersmith showed me much evil: (may the Lord give back to him according to his works:)
Whom watch thou also; for he greatly withstood our words.
In my first defence none was present with me, but all forsook me; (may it not be reckoned to them.)
But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the promulgation might be rendered perfectly certain, and all the nations might hear: and I was delivered out of the lion's mouth.
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and save for his heavenly kingdom: to whom the glory for the times of times. Amen.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
Erastus remained in Corinth: and Trophimus I left in Miletum sick.
Be earnest to come before winter Eubulus greets thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
The Lord Jesus Christ with thy Spirit. Grace with you. Amen.
Paul, servant of God, and sent of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the acknowledgment of the truth according to devotion;
In hope of eternal life, (which God, not false, promised before eternal times;
And manifested his word in his own times, in the proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to the command of the Saviour our God;)
To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
For this I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest rectify things left behind, and set elders in the city, as I directed thee:
If any be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of licentiousness, or disorderly.
For a bishop must be irreproachable, as steward of God; not self-sufficient, not prone to anger, not intemperate, not a striker, not occupied in sordid gain.
But hospitable, a lover of good, of sound mind, just, holy, holding firm;
Holding firmly the faithful word according to instruction, that he may be able also to beseech in sound doctrine, and to refute those opposing.
For many also are disorderly, vain talkers and infatuates, especially they of the circumcision:
Who must be restrained, who subvert whole houses, teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.
A certain of them said, their own prophet, The Cretians always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.
This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith;
Not holding to Jewish fictions, and commands of men, having turned away from the truth.
All things truly pure to the pure: and to the defiled and unbelieving nothing pure; but also their mind and consciousness are defiled.
They confess to know God; and in works they deny, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work not tried.
And do thou speak what becomes sound doctrine:
The aged men to be sober, grave, of sound mind, sound in the faith, in love, in patience.
The aged women likewise, becoming holy in a serene state of mind, not accusers, not slaves to much wine, teachers of good;
That they render the young women discreet, to be lovers of the husband, lovers of the children,
Of sound mind chaste, remaining at home, good subordinates to their own husbands, that the word of God be not defamed.
The younger men likewise beseech to be of sound mind.
Concerning all things hold thyself a type of good works: in doctrine, integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,
The word sound, not to be condemned; that he from the opposite may be changed, having nothing bad to say of you.
Servants to be subordinate to their own masters, to be pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
Not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour our God in all things.
For the grace of God who saves, was manifested to all men,
Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and eager worldly desires, we should live discreetly, and justly, and religiously, in the time now;
Expecting the blessed hope, and appearance of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a distinguished people, zealous of good works.
These things speak, and beseech, and reprove with all order. Let none despise thee.
Remind them to be subordinate to beginnings and powers, to yield obedience to authority, to be prepared for every good work,
To slander none, to be without fighting, equitable, showing all meekness to all men.
For once we also were unwise disobedient, deceived, being slaves to eager desires and various pleasures, living in vexation and envy, hated, and hating one another.
And when the kindness and philanthropy of our Saviour God was made evident,
Not of works in justice which we did; but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Spirit;
Which he poured out upon us richly by Jesus Christ our Saviour;
That justified by his grace, we might be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Faithful the word, and I wish for thee to be assured of these things, that they having believed God might turn their thoughts to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
And foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and conflicts pertaining to the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.
A man, a heretic after one and the second admonition, reject;
Knowing such to be turned back, and he sins, being self-condemned.
When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be earnest to come to me at Nicopolis: for there have I chosen to pass the winter.
Send forward zealously Zenas pertaining to the law, and Apollos, that nothing fail them.
And let ours also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
All they with me greet thee. Greet them loving us in the faith. Grace with you all. Amen.
PAUL, imprisoned of Jesus Christ, Timothy the brother, to Philemon, dearly beloved, and cooperating,
And to the dearly beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in thy house:
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God, always making remembrance of thee in my prayers,
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast to the Lord Jesus, and to all the holy;
So that the mutual participation of thy faith might be effective in acknowledgment of every good in you to Christ Jesus.
For we have much grace and consolation upon thy love, for the bowels of the holy are refreshed by thee, brother.
Wherefore, having much freedom of speech in Christ to enjoin thee what concerns thee,
By love I beseech rather, being such as Paul an aged man, and now also the imprisoned of Jesus Christ.
I beseech thee for my child whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus.
Once unprofitable to thee, but now more profitable to thee and to me:
Whom I sent back: and thou him, that is, my bowels, receive again:
Whom I was wishing to retain to myself, that for thee he might serve me in the bonds of the good news:
But without thy judgment I would do nothing; that good might not be as according to necessity, but according to free will.
For perhaps therefore he was separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him forever;
No more as a servant, but above a servant, a dearly beloved brother, especially to me, and how much rather to thee, also in the flesh, and in the Lord?
If therefore thou hold me a participator, receive him in addition as me.
And if he injured thee any, or is indebted, charge this to me.
I Paul wrote with my hand, I will pay back: that I say not to thee, for thou owest thyself to me also in addition.
Yea, brother, may I be profited by thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do above what I say to thee.
And at the same time also prepare for me a reception as a guest: for I hope that by your prayers I shall be given as a favor to you.
Epaphras greets thee, my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus;
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my co-workers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit. Amen.
God, formerly multifariously and abundantly having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
At these last days spake to us in the Son, whom he set heir of all things, by whom also he made the times;
Who being the brightness of glory, and the figure of his foundation, and bearing all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty among the highest ones;
Being so much better than the angels, inasmuch as he has inherited a more distinguished name than they.
For to which of the angels once said he, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for Father, and he shall be to me for Son?
And when again he should bring in the firstborn to the habitable globe, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.
And truly to the angels of God he says, Who making his angels spirits, and his workmen flames of fire.
And to the Son, Thy throne, O God, for the time of time: a rod of uprightness the rod of thy kingdom.
Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity; for this God anointed thee, thy God, with the oil of lively joy above thy partakers.
And, Thou, at the beginning, Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands:
These shall be destroyed; but thou remainest; and they all as a garment shall grow old;
And as a cloak shalt thou turn them round, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
And to which of the angels has he once said, Sit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
Are they not all spirits qualified for service, sent forth for service for them about to inherit salvation?
For this ought we to hold above measure to the things heard, lest we slip away.
For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and bad instruction received the just payment of reward;
How shall we escape, having neglected such great salvation; which at the beginning taken to be spoken by the Lord, by them having heard was made firm to us;
God confirming the testimony, together with signs and wonders, and various powers, and partitions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will.
For not to the angels has he subjected the habitable globe about to be, of which we speak.
And somewhere a certain one testified, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him? or the son of man, that thou reviewest him?
Thou didst render him some little while less than angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst place him over the work of thine hands:
All things didst thou place under his feet. For in placing all things under him, thou didst leave nothing not subjected to him. And now we see not yet all things placed under him.
But we see Jesus, made some little while less than angels by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste of death for all.
For it became him, for whom all things, and by whom all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the chief of their salvation by sufferings.
For be consecrating and they being consecrated all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Saying, I will announce thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the church will I praise thee.
And again, I will be confident in him. And again, Behold I and the young children which God gave me.
Since therefore the young children participated in flesh and blood, he also likewise participated with them; that by death he might leave unemployed him having the strength of death, that is, the devil;
And deliver them, as many as by fear of death were always to live bound by slavery.
For certainly he lays not hold of angels; but of the seed of Abraham he lays hold.
Wherefore in all things it was necessary to be made like to the brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things towards God, in order to propitiate for the sin of the people.
For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help the tempted.
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;
Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.
For this was deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he has greater honour of the house having built it.
For every house is built by somebody; and he having built all things, God.
And truly Moses faithful in his whole house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things to be spoken;
And Christ as a son over his house: whose house are we, if we should hold freedom of speech and the boast of hope firm to the end.
Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,
Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:
Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.
As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)
See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.
But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.
For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;
In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.
For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.
And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?
And to whom sware he that they could not come into his rest, if not to them having been disobedient?
And we see they could not come in through unbelief.
Let us therefore fear, lest a solemn promise being left to come into his rest, any of you should seem to have failed.
For we also were announced of the good news, as well as they: but the word of the report profited them not, not being mixed with faith to them having heard.
For we having believed come into the rest, as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall come into my rest: although the works having been from the foundation of the world.
For he said somewhere of the seventh thus, And God ceased in the seventh day from all his works.
And in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.
Since therefore it remains for some to come into it, and they before announced of the good news came not in through unbelief:
Again he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after such time; as it is said, To day if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
For if Jesus had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken of another day after these things.
Therefore a celebration of a sabbath remains to the people of God.
For he having come into his rest, he also has ceased from his works, as God from his own.
Therefore we should be earnest to come into that rest, lest any should fall in the same pattern of unbelief.
For the word of God living, and effective, and more piercing than any two-mouthed sword, and penetrating even to the division both of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrows, and a critic of the reflections and thoughts of the heart.
And there is no creation invisible before him: and all things naked and exposed, neck and face to view, to the eyes of him with whom to us is the word.
Having therefore a great chief priest, passed to the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold firmly the assent.
For we have not a chief priest unable to suffer with our weaknesses; but tried in all things as a resemblance, without sin.
We should therefore go with freedom of speech to the throne of grace, that we receive mercy, and find grace for timely assistance.
For every chief priest taken from men is appointed for men for things to God, that he bring both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Being able to moderate the passions to the ignorant, and deceived; since he also is surrounded with weakness.
And for this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to bring in for sins.
And not any takes this honour to himself; but the called of God, as also Aaron.
So also Christ honoured not himself, to become chief priest; but he having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
And also in another he says, Thou a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.
Who in the days of his flesh, both prayers and supplications to him able to save him from death, with strong crying and tears, having offered, and listened to by means of circumspection;
Although being a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;
And being perfected, he became to all them lending a willing ear to him the origin of eternal salvation.
Addressed by God the chief priest according to the order of Melchisedec.
Of whom great is the word to us, and difficult of interpretation to speak, since ye have been sluggish in the hearing.
For also ye ought to be teachers for the time, again ye have need for some one to teach you the elements of the beginning of the sayings of God; and have become those having need of milk, and not of firm food.
For every one partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice: for he is a child.
And firm food is of the perfected, of them by habit having the senses exercised for the separation of good and evil.
Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, we should go on to perfection; not again laying down the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Of the teaching of immersions, and placing upon of hands, and of the rising up of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
And this will we do, if God even permit.
For impossible for them once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and having partaken of the Holy Spirit,
And tasted of the good word of God, and powers of the life about to be,
And having fallen, again to renew to repentance; crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and exposing to ignominy.
For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon it, and bringing forth the vegetable fitting well to them by whom it is cultivated, receives commendation from God:
And producing thorns and briers is rejected, after having been tried, and near cursing; whose end for destruction.
And we have been persuaded of you, dearly beloved, of better things, and connected with salvation, if we also thus speak.
For God is not unjust to forget your work and fatigue of love, which ye showed to his name, having served to the holy ones, and serving.
And we desire each of you to show the same earnestness to the complete certainty of hope to the end:
That ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them inheriting the promises by faith and longsuffering.
For God promising to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, sware by himself,
Saying, Truly will I praise thee, and multiplying will I multiply thee.
And so, having endured long, he gained the promise.
For truly men swear by the greater: and the oath for confirmation to them the end of all controversy.
In which God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the firmness of his counsel, he intervened by an oath:
That by two unalterable deeds, in which it is impossible for God to deceive we might have a strong consolation, taking refuge in holding firmly the hope set before:
Which we have as an anchor of the soul, unshaken and firm, and entering into that further within the veil.
Where the forerunner, Jesus, went in for us, according to the order of Melchisedec, being a high priest forever.
For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, having met Abraham returning from the cutting off of the kings, and praised him;
To whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all; (first truly interpreted King of justice, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
Without father, without mother, of unknown origin, neither having beginning of days, nor end of life; and likened to the Son of God;) remains a priest perpetually.
And behold how great this one, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave the tenth of the first fruits.
And they truly of the sons of Levi, receiving the office of priest, have a command to take a tenth part from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, although having come out of the loins of Abraham:
And he not having his descent traced from them received a tenth from Abraham, and praised him having the promises.
And without all controversy the less is praised of the better.
And here truly dying men receive tenths; but there he, bearing witness that he lives.
And as the word says, through Abraham, also Levi, receiving tenths, has paid a tenth.
For yet was he in his father's loins, when Melchisedec met him.
If truly therefore completion were by the Levitical priesthood, (for the people received legislation by it,) what further need according to the order of Melchisedec for another priest to be raised, and not according to the order of Aaron?
For the priesthood being transferred, of necessity also is a transposition of law.
For he of whom these things are said partook of another tribe, of which none held to the altar.
For it is manifest that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; to which tribe Moses spake nothing of the priesthood.
And it is yet more abundantly manifest: that according to the resemblance of Melchisedec has another priest risen,
Who according to the law of a fleshly command was not born, but according to the power of an indestructible life.
For he testifies, Thou a priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec.
For there is truly an annulling of the command going before by its weakness and unprofitableness.
(For the law completed nothing,) but the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw near to God.
And as much as not without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath:
(For they truly without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath became priests; but he with the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath by him, saying to him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec:)
According to this, Jesus has become security of a better covenant.
And they truly are become many priests, by reason of death being hindered from remaining:
And he, because he remains forever, has an inviolable priesthood.
Wherefore he is able to save entirely those coming to God by him, always living to supplicate for them.
For such a chief priest became us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and being higher than the heavens;
Who has no necessity according to the day, as the chief priests, before to bring up sacrifices for their own sins, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having brought up himself.
For the law establishes men chief priests having weakness; but the word of the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath, after the law, the Son, having been perfected forever.
And the summary to the things spoken: We have such a chief priest, who sat on the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
A workman of holy things, and of the true tent, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
For every chief priest is appointed to bring in gifts and sacrifices also: wherefore it is necessary also for this to have something which he might bring.
For if truly he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests bringing in gifts according to the law;
Who serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was given an intimation of the divine will, being about to complete the tent: for, See, says he, thou make all things according to the type shewed thee in the mount.
And now he has attained a more distinguished office, in how much also he is mediator of a better covenant, which was legislated upon better promises.
For if that first was faultless, then place was not to be sought for the second.
For rebuking them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will complete for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant:
Not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in the day of my taking their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they remained not in my covenant, and I heeded them not, says the Lord.
For this the covenant which I will set to the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; giving my laws into their mind, and upon their hearts will I write them: and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people:
And they should not teach each his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from their little even to their great ones.
For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their injustices will I remember no more.
In saying new, he has made the first old. And that made old and becoming weak is near destruction.
And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.
For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.
And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;
Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaron's rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;
And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.
And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.
And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:
This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:
Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;
Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.
And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;
Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.
For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:
How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?
And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.
For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.
Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.
For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,
Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.
And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.
And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.
Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:
Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;
(Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.
And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:
So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.
For the law having a shadow of good things about to be, not the same image of the things, with these sacrifices which they bring in yearly in continuance never can render perfect them coming thereto.
For would they not have ceased to be brought in? because they serving have no more consciousness of sins, once purified.
But in these, a reminding of sins yearly.
For the blood of bulls and he-goats cannot take away sins.
Wherefore coming into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering then wouldest not, but a body hast thou adjusted to me:
And with whole burnt offering for sin wast thou not contented.
Then said I, Behold, I am here (in the head of the book it was written of me,) O God, to do thy will.
Farther back, saying, That sacrifice and bringing in and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou wouldest not, neither wert contented with; which are brought in according to law;
Then he said, Behold, I am here to do, O God, thy will. He takes away the first, that he might set up the second.
In which will we are consecrated by the bringing in of the body of Jesus Christ once.
And truly every priest has stood daily, serving and bringing in many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
But this, having brought in one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;
As to the rest, awaiting till his enemies be put a footstool of his feet.
For by one offering has he perfected forever the consecrated.
And also the Holy Spirit testifies to us: for after having said before,
This the covenant which I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws upon their heart, and upon their minds will I write them;
And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
And where remission of these, no more bringing in for sin.
Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entering in of the holies by the blood of Jesus,
A way publicly declared and living, which he consecrated to us, through the veil, that is, his flesh;
And a great priest over the house of God;
Let us approach with a true heart in complete certainty of faith, having our hearts be sprinkled from an evil consciousness, and having our bodies washed with pure water.
We should hold the assent of hope not bending; (for faithful he having promised;)
And we should observe one another for the incitement of love and good works:
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom to some; but beseeching: and by so much the more, inasmuch as ye see the day drawing near.
For we sinning voluntarily after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is left no more a sacrifice for sins,
But a certain terrible expectation of judgment and jealousy of fire, being about to devour the adversaries.
Any one having rejected Moses' law, without compassion dies by two or three witnesses:
Of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be deemed worthy, having trodden down the Son of God, and deemed the blood of the covenant common, in which he was consecrated, and having outraged the Spirit of grace?
For we know him having said, Vengeance to me, I will give back, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.
Terrible to fall into the hands of the living God.
And recall to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye endured a great combat of sufferings;
This, truly, being exposed to public view both by reproaches and pressures; and this, having been partakers of those thus overturned.
For ye also suffered together with me in bonds, and received the pillage of your possessions with joy, knowing to have in yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.
Throw not away therefore your freedom of speech, which has great payment of reward.
For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
For yet a little while only, he coming will come, and will not tarry.
And the just one shall live by faith; but if he draw down, my soul is not contented in him.
And we are not of drawing down to perdition; but of faith to the acquisition of the soul.
And faith is the foundation of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen.
For by this were the elders testified of.
By faith we perceive that the times were adjusted by the word of God, so that things seen have been born not of things brought to light.
By faith Abel brought near a greater sacrifice to God than Cain, by which he was testified of to be just, God testifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead yet speaks.
By faith Enoch was transferred not to see death; and was not found, because God had transferred him: for before his transferring he had been testified of, to have pleased God.
And without faith it is impossible to please: for he approaching to God must believe that he is, and is a remunerator to them seeking him out.
By faith Noah, having an intimation of the divine will of things not yet seen, being circumspect, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house; by which he condemned the world, and by faith became an heir of justice.
By faith Abraham, being called, listened, to go forth into the place which he was about to receive for an inheritance; and he came out, not knowing where he is coming.
By faith he dwelt in the land of promise, as a strange land, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise:
For he awaited a city having foundations, whose artificer and maker is God.
By faith Sara also herself received power for the laying down of seed, and brought forth during the time of age, for she deemed him faithful having promised.
Wherefore also from one were they born, and these of him having been dead, as the stars of heaven for multitude, and as the sand near the lip of the sea innumerable.
According to faith died all these, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar, and been persuaded, and having embraced, and assented that they are strangers and newly arrived from a foreign country upon earth.
For they saying such things show clearly that they seek a country.
And truly if they remembered that from which they came out, they had time to have returned.
And now they feel an ardent desire for a better, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them to be called their God: for he prepared for them a city.
By faith Abraham had brought near Isaac, being tried: and he having received the promises brought near the only born,
To whom it was spoken, That in Isaac shall seed be called to thee:
Reckoning that God was also able to raise from the dead; whence he also received him in a parable.
By faith concerning things about to be, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau.
By faith Jacob, dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons; and worshipped, upon the extremity of his rod.
By faith Joseph, dying, made mention of the departure of the sons of Israel: and charged concerning his bones.
By faith Moses, born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw a shrewd child; and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.
By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be reckoned the son of Pharaoh's daughter;
Having chosen rather to be treated ill with the people of God, than to have the enjoyment of sin for a time;
Having deemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than treasures in Egypt: for he looked to the payment of reward.
By faith he forsook Egypt, not having feared the king's wrath: for, as seeing the invisible, he was strong.
By faith he has kept the pascha, and the pouring out of blood, lest he destroying the first born should touch them.
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians having tried were swallowed down.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been surrounded for seven days.
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with the unbelieving, having received the spies with peace.
And what more do I say? for the time will fail me recounting of Gedeon, Barak, and also Samson and Jephthae; David also, and Samuel, and the prophets:
Who by faith subdued kingdoms, wrought justice, attained the promises, shut up the mouths of lions,
Quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the sword, were strengthened from weakness, were strong in war, turned away the armies of strangers.
Women received their dead from rising up: and others were beaten, not receiving redemption; that they might attain a better resurrection.
And others received trial of jestings and scourges, and further, of bonds and imprisonment:
They were stoned, they were cut by sawing, they were tried, they died by the slaughter of the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being in want, pressed, treated ill;
(Of whom the world was not worthy:) wandering about in solitary places, and mountains, and caves, and holes of the earth.
And these all, having been testified of by faith, received not the promise:
God having foreseen something better for us, that without us they should not be completed.
Wherefore we also having such a cloud of witnesses lying round about us, having laid down every weight, and sin easily captivating, by patience we should run the race set before us,
Looking in the distance to Jesus the author and completer of the faith; who for the joy laid before him endured the cross, having despised the shame, and sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
For reckon over him having endured such contradiction of the sinful against himself, lest being harassed, ye labor in your souls.
Ye have not yet resisted until blood, fighting against sin.
And ye have totally forgotten the entreaty which is spoken to you as to sons, My son, neglect not the instruction of the Lord, nor be enervated being rebuked by him:
For whom the Lord loves he corrects, and he chastises every son which he receives.
If ye endure correction, God treats you as sons; for who is the son which the father corrects not?
And if ye are without correction, of which all are partakers, then are ye spurious, not sons.
Since we truly have fathers of our flesh instructors, and we were influenced: shall we not rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?
For they truly for a few days, according as it seemed to them, corrected; but he for profit, in order to partake in his holiness.
And truly every correction for the present seems not to be for joy, but grief: and later it returns the peaceful fruit of justice to them being exercised by it.
Wherefore set upright the relaxed hands, and palsied knees;
And make straight wheel-ruts to your feet, lest the lame thing turned aside; and it should rather be healed.
Follow peace with all, and consecration, without which none shall see the Lord:
Observing narrowly lest any be failing of the grace of God: lest any root of bitterness springing forth aloft give trouble, and by this many be defiled;
Lest any fornicator, or profane, as Esau, who for one act of eating sold his primogeniture.
For ye know also afterwards, wishing to inherit the praise, he was disapproved of: for he found no place for a change of mind, although having sought it with tears.
For ye have not come to the mount being handled, and burned with fire, and to duskiness, and to darkness, and to a violent storm,
And to the sound of the trumpet, and the voice of words; which they, having heard, implored that the word be not put before them:
(For they did not bear that being assigned, And if a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shall be pierced with a missile weapon:
And so dreadful was that being made to appear, Moses said, I am terrified and trembling:)
But ye have come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,
To the assembly of people, and church of the firstborn, transcribed in the heavens, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the just perfected,
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better things than Abel.
See that ye refuse not him speaking. For if they escaped not, having refused him giving an intimation of the divine will on earth, much more we, who having turned back from him from the heavens:
Whose voice then shook the earth: and now he has proclaimed, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.
And the Yet once more, makes manifest the transferring the things shaken, as of things made, that the things not being shaken might remain.
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom unmoved; we should have grace by which we might serve God acceptably, with reverence and circumspection:
For also our God is a consuming fire.
Let brotherly love remain.
Forget not hospitality: for by this some knew not having treated angels with friendship.
Remember them in bonds as bound together with them; them treated ill, as the same being in the body.
Marriage honoured in all, and the bed unpolluted: but fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
The disposition exempt from avarice; being contented with present circumstances: for he has said, I will not send thee back, nor forsake thee.
So that being confident, we say, The Lord aiding me, and I will not fear what man will do to me.
Remember them guiding you, who spake to you the word of God: of whom, observing narrowly the issue of the mode of life, imitate the faith:
Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day the same, and for ever.
With various and strange teachings be not carried about. For good the heart be rendered firm by grace; not by food, in which they having walked about were not profited.
We have an altar, of which they serving the tent have no power to eat.
For of whom the blood of the living ones is brought for sin into the holies by the chief priest, the bodies of these are burned without the camp.
Wherefore also Jesus, that he might consecrate the people by his own blood, suffered without the camp.
Therefore we should come to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
For here have we no abiding city, but we seek that about to be.
By him therefore we should always bring up the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of the lips assenting to his name.
And the doing good and mutual participation forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Believe them guiding you, and yield: (for they watch vigilantly for your souls, as going to return the word.) that with joy they might do this, and not lamenting: for this unprofitable for you.
Pray for us: for we have trusted that we have a good consciousness, in all things wishing to be well occupied.
And I beseech the more abundantly to do this, that I might the more speedily be restored to you.
And the God of peace, having brought up from the dead, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ,
Put you in proper order in every good work for doing his will, doing in you the thing pleasing before him, by Jesus Christ; to whom glory for the time of times. Amen.
And I beseech you, brethren, hold up the word of entreaty: for I also sent to you in a few words.
Ye know the brother Timothy having been set at liberty; with whom, if he come more speedily, I shall see you.
Greet all them guiding you, and all the holy.
They from Italy greet you. Grace with you all. Amen.
James, servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion, health.
Deem all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various trials;
Knowing that the proof of your faith works patience.
And let patience have a perfect work, that ye be perfect and entire, being left behind in nothing.
If any of you is forsaken of wisdom, let him ask of God, giving to all plainly, blaming not; and it shall be given him.
And let him ask in faith, being at variance in nothing. For he being at variance is like the surge of the sea being moved by the wind and put in motion.
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
A man divided in opinion unsteady in all his ways.
And let the humble brother boast in his elevation:
And the rich, in his humiliation: for as the flower of the grass he shall pass by.
For the sun sprang up with heat, and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the decorum of its face was destroyed: so also shall the rich be dried up in his goings.
Happy the man who endures temptation: for being tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them loving him.
Let none say being tempted, that I am tempted of God: for God is not tempted of evils, and he tempts none:
And each is tempted from his own lust, being drawn out, and decoyed.
So then lust conceiving, brings forth sin: and sin performed, produces death.
Be not led astray, my dearly beloved brethren.
Every good donation and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom not one change, or shadow of turning.
Having willed he brought forth by the word of truth, for us to be some first fruit of his creatures.
Wherefore, my dearly beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger:
For man s anger works not the justice of God.
Wherefore having put away all sordid avarice, and excess of wickedness, in meekness receive the implanted word, able to save your souls.
And be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man observing the face of his creation in a mirror:
For he observed himself, and went away, and straightway forgot of what kind he was.
And he having stooped into the perfect law of liberty, and remained, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work, he shall be happy in his doing.
If any among you seem to be religious, bridling not his tongue, but deceiving his heart, the religion of this one vain.
Religion pure and unpolluted before God and the Father is this, To take a view of the orphans and widows in their pressure, to keep himself free from stain from the world.
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, of glory, with distinction of faces.
For if there come into your synagogue a man wearing gold rings on is fingers, in brilliant clothing, and there come in also a beggar in filthy clothing;
And ye look toward him bearing the brilliant clothing, and ye say to him, Sit thou well here; and to the beggar ye say, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
Were ye not separated among yourselves, and become judges of evil reflections?
Hear, my dearly beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the beggars of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them loving him?
And ye have despised the beggar. Do not the rich bring you into subjection, and draw you before tribunals?
And do they not defame the good name called upon you?
If yet ye complete the royal law according to the writing, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:
And if ye make distinction of faces, ye work sin, being convicted under the law as transgressors.
For whoever shall keep the whole law, and stumble in one, has become bound of all.
For he having said, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, said also, Thou shouldest not kill: and if thou commit not adultery, and dost kill, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.
So speak ye, and so do, as about to be judged by the law of liberty.
For unpropitiated judgment to him not doing mercy; and mercy boasteth against judgment.
And what profit, my brethren, if any say he has faith, and should not have works? can faith save him?
And if a brother or sister be naked, and be failing of daily food,
And any of you say to them, Retire in peace, be ye warmed and be ye fed; and ye give them not things fitting the body; what profit?
So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.
But certain will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith from my works.
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: and the evil spirits believe, and shudder.
And wilt thou know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar.
Thou seest that faith cooperated with his works, and from works was faith perfected.
And the writing was completed, saying, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice: and he was called the Friend of God.
Therefore ye see that man is justified from works, and not from faith alone.
And likewise also was not Rehab the harlot justified by works, having received the messengers, and cast out by another way?
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.
For in many things we all stumble. If any stumble not in word, this a perfect man, able to govern by a bridle also the whole body.
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they should yield to us; and we lead their whole body.
Behold also ships, being so great, and driven by hard winds, are led by the smallest rudder, wherever the desire of him steering should will.
So also the tongue is a small member, and vaunts itself. Behold, how great a wood a little fire inflames.
(And the tongue a fire, a world of iniquity: so the tongue is placed in our members, defiling the whole body, and burning the wheel of creation; and burned by hell.
For every nature of beasts, and also of birds, of creeping things, and also of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the nature of man:
And the tongue none of men can tame; an ungovernable evil, full of deadly poison.
With it we praise the God and Father; and with it we curse men, those made according to the similitude of God.
Out of the same month comes forth blessing and cursing. There is no need, my brethren, for these things so to be.
Much less from the same aperture does a fountain bubble out sweet and bitter?
The fig tree, my brethren, cannot make olives, or the vine, figs: so no fountain can make salt and sweet water.
Who wise and knowing among you? let him show out of a good mode of life his works in meekness of wisdom.
And if ye have bitter envy and intrigue in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.
This is wisdom coming not down from above, but earthly, natural, resembling an evil spirit.
For where envy and intrigue, there confusion and every bad deed.
And the wisdom from above is truly first pure, then peaceful, decorous, docile, full of mercy and good fruits, not separated, and unfeigned.
And the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those making peace.
Whence wars and fights among you? are they not hence, out of your sensual pleasures making war in your members.
Ye eagerly desire, and have not: ye kill, and are zealous, and cannot succeed: ye fight and wage war, and ye have not, because ye ask not.
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask wickedly that ye might expend upon your sensual pleasures.
Adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is the enmity of God? whoever therefore would wish to be the friend of the world is set the enemy of God.
Or think ye that the writing says vainly, That the spirit longs for envy, which dwelt in us?
And he gives greater grace. Wherefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Be subjected therefore to God. Resist the accuser, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinful; and purify the hearts, ye double souled.
Toil, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and joy to dejection.
Be ye humbled before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
Speak not against one another, brethren. He speaking against a brother, and judging his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: and if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
There is one legislator, able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another.
Come on now, ye saying, To day or to morrow let us go to this city, and do there one year, and let us trade, and derive profit:
(Which know not that of the morrow. For what your life? For it is a steam, appearing for a little, and then invisible.)
For you should say, If the Lord will, and we live, and should do this, or that.
And now ye boast in your arrogance: all such boasting is evil.
Therefore to him knowing to do good, and not doing, to him it is sin.
Come on now, ye rich, weep, uttering loud cries of grief for the misfortunes coming upon you.
Your riches have become corrupted, and your garments have been moth eaten;
Your gold and silver is become rusty; and their rust shall be for a witness to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have gathered up treasures in the last days.
Behold, the hire of laborers having reaped your farms, withheld by you, cries out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.
Ye have led a luxurious life upon the earth, and have rioted in luxury; ye have nourished your hearts, as in the day of slaughter.
Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just one; and he resists you not.
Therefore be longsuffering, brethren, even to the arrival of the Lord. Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering for it, even till he should receive the early and late rain.
Be longsuffering, ye also; make your hearts firm: for the arrival of the Lord has drawn near.
Groan not against one another, brethren, that ye be not condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.
Take a pattern of affliction, my brethren, and of longsuffering, the prophets, who spake in the name of the Lord.
Behold, we esteem those enduring happy. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and ye see the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
And before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor any other oath: and let your yea be yea; and nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.
Does any suffer among you? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him play on the harp.
Is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord:
And the prayer of faith shall save him being sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he should have wrought sins, it shall be remitted to him.
Acknowledge your faults to one another, and pray for one another, that ye might be healed. The prayer of the just, being energetic, is very powerful.
Elias was a man having similar feelings with us, and in prayer he prayed for it not to rain: and it rained not upon the earth for three years and six months.
And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth shot forth her fruit.
Brethren, if any among you be led astray from the truth, and any should turn him back;
Let him know, that he having turned the sinful from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
Peter, sent of Jesus Christ, to the chosen strangers of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the consecration of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.
Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy having begotten us again to a living hope, by the rising up of Jesus Christ from the dead,
To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, kept in the heavens for us,
Who by the power of God watching ourselves by faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
By which ye are transported with joy, now for a little, (if it is necessary,) having grieved in various temptations:
That the proof of your faith, much more precious than perishing gold, and being tried by fire, might be found to praise and honour and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ:
Whom not having seen, ye love; in whom, now not seeing, but believing, ye are transported with joy unalterable, and highly valued:
Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of souls.
For which salvation the prophets sought and inquired anxiously, they having prophesied of the grace to you:
Searching for whom or what time the Spirit of Christ which in them manifested, testifying beforehand the sufferings to Christ, and the glories after these.
To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were serving these things, which now have been again proclaimed to you by them having announced the good news in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; into which angels eagerly desire to stoop and creep.
Wherefore having girded up the loins of your mind, living abstemiously, hope perfectly upon the grace brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ;
As children of obedience, not as formerly conforming yourselves to eager desire in your ignorance:
But according to the holy one calling you, also should ye yourselves be holy in all turning back;
For it has been written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
And if ye call upon the Father, judging without distinction of persons according to the work of each, in fear be occupied in the time of your sojourning:
Knowing that not with corruptible things, silver and gold, were ye redeemed from your vain mode of life transmitted from your fathers.
But with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless, of Christ:
Known truly before the foundation of the world, and made manifest in the last times for you,
Who by him believing in God, having raised him from the dead, and having given him glory; that your faith and hope should be in God.
Having purified your souls in the hearing of the truth by the Spirit to unfeigned brotherly love, out of pure hearts love ye one another cordially:
Begotten again, not of corrupted seed, but uncorrupted, by the word of God, living and remaining forever.
For all flesh as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass dried up, and the flower fell out:
And the word of the Lord remains forever. And this is the word having announced good news to you.
Therefore setting aside all wickedness, and all artifice, and dissimulation; and envies, and all calumnies,
As new born babes, long for the sincere milk pertaining to the word, that ye might be nourished with it:
If ye have tasted that the Lord is good.
To whom approaching, a living stone, truly disapproved of by men, and chosen by God, highly valued,
And ye yourselves are built, as living stones, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to bring up spiritual sacrifice; acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
Wherefore also it holds in the writing, Behold, I place in Zion a corner stone, chosen, highly valued: and he believing on him shall not be ashamed.
Therefore honour to you believing: and to the unbelieving, the stone which the builders disapproved of has become the head of the corner,
And a stone of stumble, and rock of offence, they disbelieving the word stumble: to which also they were set.
And ye a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for acquisition; so that ye should proclaim the excellencies of him having called you out of darkness into his wonderful light:
Who once not a people, and now the people of God: they not commiserated, and now commiserated.
Dearly beloved, I beseech as sojourners and strangers, to keep off from fleshly passions, which war against the soul;
Having your turning back good in the nations: that, in what they speak against you as doing evil, from good works, they having beheld, might praise God in the day of inspection.
Be subjected to every creation proceeding from man on account of the Lord: whether to the king, as having superiority;
Or to chiefs, as sent by him for the punishing of them doing evil, and the praise of them doing good.
(For so is the will of God, those doing good to silence the want of knowledge of the foolish men:)
As free, and as not having liberty for a covering of wickedness, but as the servants of God.
Honour all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
Servants being subjected to masters in all fear; not only to the good and equitable, but also to the crooked.
For this is grace, if any by consciousness of God bear grief, suffering unjustly.
For what glory, if, sinning and being cuffed, ye endure? but if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure, this is grace with God.
For to this were ye called: for also Christ suffered for you, leaving behind to you an underwriting, that ye should follow upon his footsteps:
Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth:
Who, being reviled, reviled not back; suffering, he threatened not; and delivered to him judging justly;
Who himself bear up our sins in his body upon the wood, that we, removed from sins, should live to justice: by whose bloody mark ye were healed.
For ye were as sheep going astray; but now have turned about to the Shepherd and inspector of your souls.
Likewise, wives being subject to their own husbands; that also, if any believe not the word, by the turning back of wives might be gained without the word;
Having beheld in fear your pure turning back.
Whose outside let it not be of the interweaving of hairs, and of putting round of gold, or of putting on of garments, the arrangement;
But the hidden man of the heart, in the uncorruptedness of a mild and quiet spirit, which is before God of great price.
For so once also the holy women, hoping in God, arranged themselves, being subjected to their own husbands:
(As Sara listened to Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye are,) doing good, and not fearing any terror.
Men, likewise, dwelling together according to knowledge, as showing honour to the weaker vessel, pertaining to woman, and as co-heirs of the grace of life; that your prayers be not cut off.
And finally, all unanimous, suffering together, loving the brethren, having good bowels, an affectionate disposition:
Not returning evil for evil, or railing for railing: and on the contrary prayer; knowing that to this were ye called, that ye might inherit praise.
For he wishing to love life, and to see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit:
Let him bend away from evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and follow it.
For the eyes of the Lord upon the just, and his ears to their prayer: and the face of the Lord against them doing evil.
And who going to injure you, if ye be imitators of good?
But if ye also suffer for justice, happy are ye: be not afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;
And consecrate the Lord God in your hearts: and being ready always for a justification to every one asking you the word of the hope in you with meekness and fear:
Having a good consciousness; that, in what they speak evil against you, as doing evil, they threatening your good turning round in Christ should be ashamed.
Fur better, doing good, if the will of God will, to suffer, than doing evil.
For Christ also once suffered for sins, the just one for the unjust, that he might bring us near to God, truly put to death in the flesh, and made alive by the Spirit:
In which also having gone, he proclaimed to the spirits in prison;
They having been once unbelieving, when the longsuffering of God waited in Noah's days, the ark being prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
By which also the figure, immersion, now saves us (not by laying aside of the filth of the flesh, but the question of a good consciousness toward God,) by the rising up of Jesus Christ:
Who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers subjected to him.
Therefore Christ having suffered for us in the flesh, also arm ye yourselves with the same mind: (for he having suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin;)
That no more to the eager desires of men, but to the will of God, should he live the remaining time in the flesh.
For the time of life passed over sufficient for us to have wrought the will of the nations, having gone in licentiousness, eager desires, drunkenness, revellings, drinkings, and criminal idolatries:
In which they are astonished, you not running together in the same pouring out of lavish expense, blaspheming:
Who shall return the word to him holding in readiness to judge the living and the dead.
For also for this was the good news announced to the dead, that truly they might be judged according to men in the flesh, and live according to God in the spirit.
And the end of all has drawn near: be ye therefore of sound mind, and live abstemiously in prayers.
More than all having intent love among yourselves: for love shall cover a multitude of sins.
Being hospitable to one another without murmurings.
As each received favor, serving the same among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
If any speak, as the oracles of God; if any serve, as of the strength which God furnishes: that in all God might be praised by Jesus Christ, in whom is the glory and strength for the time of times. Amen.
Dearly beloved, be not astonished at the refining of fire in you, being for trial to you, as a strange thing happening to you:
But, inasmuch as ye participate in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice; that also, in the revelation of his glory, ye might rejoice, transported with joy.
If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, ye happy; for the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you: by them truly he is defamed, and by you he is praised.
For let not any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or doing evil, or as an inspector, in what pertains to others.
And if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him praise God in this portion.
For the time for judgment to have begun from the house of God: and if first from us, what the end of them not believing the good tidings of God?
And if the just one with difficulty be saved, where shall the irreligious and sinful appear.
Therefore let them also suffering according to the will of God commit their souls in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
The elders among you I beseech, a fellow elder, and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a participator of the glory which is about to be revealed:
Tend the flock of God which among you, inspecting, not by force, but voluntarily; neither occupied in sordid gain, but of a ready will;
Neither as ruling over the portions obtained by lot, but being types of the flock.
And the chief Shepherd having been manifested, ye shall be attired with an unfading crown of glory.
Likewise, ye younger, be subjected to the elders. And all being subject to one another, be wrapped up in humility: for God opposes the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
Therefore be humbled under the strong hand of God, that he might lift you up) in due measure:
Having cast all your care upon him; for to him is the care for you.
Be abstemious, watch; for your adversary the accuser, as a roaring lion, walks around, seeking whom he might swallow down:
Whom resist firm in the faith, knowing that the same of sufferings are completed by your brotherhood in the world.
And the God of all grace, having called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, may he put you in proper order, having suffered a little time, may he support you, make firm, lay the foundation.
To him the glory and the strength for the time of times. Amen.
By Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, I wrote briefly, beseeching, and bearing testimony this to be the true grace of God in which ye stand.
The chosen together in Babylon, greet you; also Marcus my son.
Greet one another in a kiss of love. Peace to all you which in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Simon Peter, servant and sent of Jesus Christ, to them having received by inheritance equally honoured faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
As his divine power having bestowed upon us all things which for life and devotion, by the knowledge of him having called us by glory and fitness:
(By which the greatest and precious promises are bestowed upon us: that by these ye might be having escaped from the corruption in the world through eager desires.)
And also this same, having brought in at the side all earnestness, furnish in addition in your faith fitness; and In fitness knowledge;
And in knowledge self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience devotion;
And in devotion brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.
For these being to you, and abounding, they establish you not without effort, neither unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For in whom these are not present, he is blind, being affected with shortness of sight, having taken forgetfulness of the cleansing formerly of his sins.
Wherefore rather, brethren, be earnest to have your calling and selection made firm: for doing these, ye should not once stumble:
For so shall an entrance be furnished richly to you in addition into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Wherefore I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, though having known, and being supported in the present truth.
And I deem just, in as far as I am in this tent, to arouse you by putting in mind;
Knowing that the laying aside of my tent is swift; as also our Lord Jesus Christ manifested to me.
And I shall also be earnest for you always to have, after my exit, this putting in mind to be done.
For not having followed ingeniously contrived fictions, we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having been spectators of his majesty.
For having received from God the Father honour and glory, and such a voice brought to him from the magnificent glory, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.
And this voice brought from heaven we heard, being with him in the holy mountain.
And we have the prophetic word more firm; which holding to, ye do well, as to a light shining in a dusty place, even till the day shine through, and the morning star spring up in your hearts:
Knowing this first, that every prophecy of the writing is not of private solution.
For prophecy was not once brought by the will of man: but holy men of God spake, being moved by the Holy Spirit.
And also were there false prophets among the people, as also among you shall be false teachers, who shall privately bring in doctrines of perdition, and denying the master having purchased them, having brought upon themselves swift destruction.
(And many shall follow their licentiousness; by whom the way of truth shall be defamed.)
And by covetousness with feigned words shall trade in you: to whom judgment since a long while is not inactive, and their perdition sleeps not.
For if God spared not the angels having sinned, but delivered up, hurled into Tartarus, to cords of darkness, having been kept for judgment;
And spared not the old world, but Noah the eighth, a herald of justice, he watched, having brought an inundation upon the world of the irreligious;
And the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha having reduced to ashes, condemned with a catastrophe, a pattern set to them about to act irreligiously;
And just Lot, being harassed by the licentiousness of the lawless for the turning back, he delivered:
(For the just one in seeing and hearing, dwelling among them, from day to day tried the just soul with lawless works;)
The Lord knows to deliver the religious out of temptation, and to keep the unjust restrained for the day of judgment;
And chiefly them going after the flesh in eager desire of defilement, and despising dominion. Self-sufficient, rash men, they tremble not, defaming glories.
Where angels, being greater in strength and power, bring not defaming judgment against them to the Lord.
But these, as natural irrational living creatures, having been for catching and destroying, defaming in what things they are ignorant of; and shall be destroyed in their corruption;
Receiving the reward of injustice, deeming luxurious indulgence pleasure in the day. Spots and blemishes, rioting in their deceits, feasting together with you.
Having eyes full of an adulteress, not ceasing from sin; decoying unstable souls: having a heart exercised with covetousness; children of a curse:
Having forsaken the straight way, they were led astray, having followed in the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the reward of injustice;
And he had reprehension for his own iniquity: the dumb ass speaking in man's voice impeded the insanity of the prophet.
These are fountains wanting water, clouds impelled by a hurricane; for whom the obscurity of darkness has been kept forever.
For speaking excessive things of vanity, they decoy with the eager desires of the flesh, for licentiousness, them having truly escaped from those turned back in error.
Promising them liberty, they being servants of corruption: for by whom any is conquered, by him has he been made to serve.
For if having escaped the pollutions of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and again entangling with these, they be conquered, the last things have been to them worse than the first.
For it was better for them not to have known the way of justice, than, having known, to turn back from the holy command delivered to them.
And that of the true proverb has happened to them, The dog having turned back to his own vomit; and the sow having been washed to the rolling of the mire.
Now this, dearly beloved, the second epistle I write to you; in which I awaken your pure mind by putting in remembrance:
To remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and the command of us the sent of the Lord and Saviour:
Knowing this first, that in the last of the days shall mockers come for deceiving, going according to their own eager desires,
And saying, Where is the solemn promise of his presence? for from the time the fathers were set to sleep, so continue all things from the beginning of creation.
For being willing this is unknown to them, that the heavens were a long while ago, and the earth having stood out of water and by water, by the word of God:
By which then the world, overflowed with water, perished:
And now the heavens and the earth, by the same word are stored up, being kept for fire to the day of judgment and of the perdition of irreligious men.
And let not this one thing be unknown to you, dearly beloved, that one day with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
The Lord puts not off the solemn promise, as some deem slowness; but is longsuffering to us, not willing any to perish, but all should have room for repentance.
And the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a loud noise, and the elements, suffering from excessive heat, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it shall be burned down.
Therefore all these being dissolved, of what race ought ye to be in holy turning round and devotion,
Expecting and seeking earnestly the presence of the day of God, during which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements going to be burned are melted away?
But we expect new heavens and a new earth, according to promise, in which dwells justice.
Wherefore, dearly beloved, expecting these, be earnest, spotless and blameless, to be found by him in peace.
And the longsuffering of our Lord deem ye salvation; as also our dearly beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you;
As also in all the epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things difficult to understand, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also the rest of the writings, to their own perdition.
You therefore, dearly beloved, knowing beforehand, watch, lest, led away by the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own stability.
And grow ye in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him the glory now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
What was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our own hands felt, concerning the word of life;
(And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and we testify, and announce to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)
What we have seen and heard we announce to you, that ye also might have communion with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
And these we write to you, that your joy might be filled up.
And this is the message which we have heard from him, and we announce to you, that God is light, and no darkness is in him.
If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we are deceived, and do not the truth:
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just that he let go sins to us, and cleanse us from all injustice.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
My little children, I write these to you, that ye sin not. And if any sin, we have an intercessor with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:
And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
And in this we know that we have known him, if we should keep his commands.
He saying, I have known him, and not keeping his commands, is a liar, and in him is not the truth.
Whoever should keep his word, truly in him has the word of God been completed: in this we know that we are in him.
He saying he remains in him ought, as he walked about, so also he to walk about.
Brethren, I write no new command to you, but an old command which ye had from the beginning. The old command is the word which ye heard from the beginning.
Again, I write a new command to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is passed away, and the true light already shines.
He saying he is in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
He loving his brother remains in light, and there is no stumbling-block in him.
And he hating his brother is in darkness, and walks about in darkness, and knows not where he goes forward, for darkness has blinded his eyes.
I write to you, little children, for your sins are let go for his name.
I write to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, for ye have conquered the evil. I write to you, young children, for ye have known the Father.
I wrote to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, for ye are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and ye have conquered the evil.
Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
For every thing which in the world, the eager desire of the flesh, and the eager desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
And the world passes away, and its eager desires: but he doing the will of God remains for ever.
Young children, it is the last hour: and as ye have heard that antichrist comes, and now many antichrists have come; whence we know that it is the last hour.
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they had remained with us, but, that they might be manifested, that they are not all of us.
And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things.
I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
Who is a liar if not he denying that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, denying the Father and the Son.
Every one denying the Son, neither has the Father: he acknowledging the Son, has also the Father.
What therefore ye have heard from the beginning, let remain in you. If it remain in you what ye heard from the beginning, ye also shall remain in the Son, and in the Father.
And this is the promise which he promised us, eternal life.
These I wrote to you concerning them deceiving you.
And the anointing which ye received from him remains in you, and ye have no need that any teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie, and as it taught you, ye shall remain in him.
And now, little children, remain in him; that, when he be manifested, we might have freedom of speech, that we be not shamed from him in his presence.
If ye know that he is just, ye know that every one doing justice has been born of him.
See ye, what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called the children of God: for this the world knows us not, for it knew him not.
Dearly beloved, now are we the children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be: and we know that, if he be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
And every one having this hope in him purifies himself, as he himself is pure.
Every one doing sin also does lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness.
And ye know that he was manifested that he might let go our sins; and in him is no sin.
Every one remaining in him sins not: every one sinning has not seen him, nor known him.
Little children, let none deceive you: he doing justice is just, as he is just.
He doing sin is of the accuser; for the accuser sins from the beginning. For this was the Son of God manifested, that he might loose the works of the accuser.
Every one born of God does not sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, for he has been born of God.
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the accuser: every one not doing justice is not of God, and he not loving his brother.
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
Not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what slew he him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother just.
Be not amazed, my brethren, if the world hate you.
We know that we have passed from death to life, for we love the brethren. He not loving the brother remains in death.
Every one hating his brother is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer has eternal life remaining in him.
In this have we known love, for he set his soul for us: and we ought to set the souls for the brethren.
And whoever has the life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and should shut up his bowels from him, how remains the love of God in him?
My little children, we should not love in word, neither in tongue; but in work and truth.
And in this we know that we are of the truth, and we will yield our hearts before him.
For if our heart condemn us, for God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have freedom of speech towards God.
And whatever we ask, we receive of him, for we keep his commands, and do things pleasing before him.
And this is his command, That we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us command.
And he keeping his commands remains in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit he gave us.
Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they are of God: for many false prophets have come out into the world.
In this ye know the spirit of God: Every spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is of God:
And every spirit which acknowledges not Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that of antichrist which ye have heard comes; and now is already in the world.
Ye are of God, little children, and have conquered them: for greater is he in you, than he in the world.
They are of the world: for this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
We are of God: he knowing God hears us; he is not of God who hears us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
Dearly beloved, we should love one another: for love is of God; and every one loving has been born of God, and knows God.
He not loving knows not God; for God is love.
In this was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only born Son into the world, that we might live by him.
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.
Dearly beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
None has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is completed in us.
In this we know that we remain in him, and he in us, for he has given us of his Spirit.
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his. Son a Saviour of the world.
Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and he remaining in love remains in God, and God in him.
In this has love been completed with us, that we might have freedom of speech in the day of judgment: for as he is, so are we in this world.
Fear is not in love; but perfected love casts out fear: for fear has restraint. And he fearing has not been perfected in love.
We should love him, for he first loved us.
If any say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he not loving his brother whom he has seen, God whom he has not seen, how can he love?
And this command have we from him, That he loving God love his brother also.
Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God: and every one loving him having begotten, loves him also begotten of him.
In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commands.
For this is the love of God, that we keep his commands: and his commands are not heavy.
For everything begotten of God conquers the world: and this is the victory having conquered the world, our faith.
Who is he conquering the world, if not he believing that Jesus is the Son of God?
This is he having come by water and blood, Jesus the Christ; not by water alone, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is testifying, for the Spirit is truth.
For three are testifying (in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.
And three are testifying in the earth,) the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are for one.
If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater: for this is the testimony of God which he has testified concerning his Son.
He believing in the Son of God has the testimony in himself: he not believing God has made him a liar; for he has not believed the testimony which God has testified of his Son.
And this is the testimony, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
He having the Son has life; and he not having the Son of God has not life.
These I wrote to you believing in the name of the Son of God; ye might know that ye have eternal life, and that ye might believe in the name of the Son of God.
And this is the freedom of speech which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:
And if we know that he hear us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
If any see his brother sinning a sin not to death, he shall ask, and sinning will give him life to them sinning not to death. There is a sin to death: I say not of that, that he should ask.
All injustice is sin: and there is a sin not to death.
We know that every one born of God sins not; but he born of God keeps himself, and evil touches him not.
We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in evil.
And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, and we know him true, and we are in him true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
Little children, watch yourselves from idols. Amen.
The elder to the chosen mistress in truth; (and not I only, but also all and to her children, whom I love they having known the truth;)
For the truth remaining in us, and shall be with us forever.
There shall be with you grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth, and love.
I was greatly rejoiced that I found of thy children walking about in the truth, as we received a command from the Father.
And now I entreat thee, mistress, not as writing a new command, but what we had from the beginning, that we should love one another.
And this is love, that we walk about according to his commands. This is the command, That as ye heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
For many cheats come into the world, they not acknowledging Jesus Christ coming in the flesh. This is the cheat and antichrist.
Look to yourselves, lest we should destroy what things we have wrought, but we should receive a full reward.
Every one passing by, and not remaining in the teaching of Christ, has not God. He remaining in the teaching of Christ, the same also has the Father and the Son.
If there come any to you, and bring not this teaching, receive ye him not into the household, and to rejoice tell him not:
For he telling him to rejoice, partakes of his evil works.
Having many things to write to you, I was not willing by paper and ink: but I hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to month, that our joy might be filled up.
The children of thy chosen sister greet thee. Amen.
The elder to the dearly beloved Gains, whom I love in truth.
Dearly beloved, I pray above all things that thou succeed and be in good health, as thy soul succeeds.
For I was greatly rejoiced, the brethren coming and testifying to thy truth, as thou walkest about in the truth.
I have no joy greater than these that I hear my children walking in truth.
Dearly beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou dost work for the brethren, and for strangers;
Who testified to thy love before the church: thou shalt do well, having sent them forward worthily of God.
For, for his name went they forth, receiving nothing from the nations.
Therefore ought we to receive such, that we might be workers together in the truth.
I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, seeking the superiority over them, receives us not.
Therefore, if I should come, I will put him in mind of his works which he does, talking silly against us with evil words: and not being satisfied in these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and hinders those being willing, and casts out of the church.
Dearly beloved, imitate not evil, but good. He doing good is of God: and he doing evil has not seen God.
It has been testified to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify; and know that our testimony is true.
I have many things to write, but I will not by ink and pen write to thee:
And I hope presently to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name.
Jude, servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the consecrated in God the Father, and the kept in Jesus Christ, the called:
Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.
Dearly beloved, making all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, beseeching to fight for the faith once delivered to the holy ones.
For certain men entered in by stealth, long ago written of beforehand for judgment, irreligious, having changed the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.
And I wish to remind you, ye having once known this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, the second time destroyed them not having believed.
Also the angels not having kept their beginning, but having left their own habitation, he has kept in perpetual chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
As Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them, debauched in like manner to these, and having gone away after other flesh, are set before a sample of eternal fire, enduring punishment.
And likewise indeed these dreaming truly defile the flesh, and despise dominion, and defame glories.
But Michael the archangel, when fighting with the accuser, discussed concerning the body of Moses, dared not to bring the judgment of defamation, but said, May the Lord censure thee.
And these truly what things they know not they defame: and what things naturally, as irrational animals, they know, in these they corrupt themselves.
Woe to them for they went in the way of Cain, and were poured out in the error of Balaam for a reward, and they were destroyed in the controversy of Core.
These are spots in your loves, feasting together fearlessly, taking care of themselves: clouds wanting water, carried about by winds; decayed trees, unfruitful, twice dead, uprooted;
Fierce waves of the sea, foaming out their own shames; wandering stars, to whom the obscurity of darkness has been kept forever.
And also of these prophesied Enoch, the seventh from Adam, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,
To do judgment to all, and to convince all their irreligious of all their works of irreligion which they have impiously acted, and of all the hard things which the sinful irreligious spake against him.
These are murmurers, discontented, going according to their eager desires; and their mouth speaks exceeding bulky things, admiring faces on account of advantage.
And ye, dearly beloved, remember the words spoken before by the sent of our Lord Jesus Christ;
For they said to you that in the last time shall be deceivers, going according to the eager desires of their impieties.
These are they separating themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit.
And ye, dearly beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life,
And truly compassionate some, discriminating:
And some save in fear, snatching out of the fire; hating also the coat stained from the flesh.
And to him able to watch yourselves from falling, and to place blameless before his glory with transport of joy,
To the only wise God our Saviour, glory and majesty, and strength and power, also for now and for all times. Amen.
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants what things must be with speed; and he signified having sent by his angel to his servant John:
Who bare witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, as much as he saw.
Happy he reading, and they hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things written in it, for the time is near.
John to the seven churches which in Asia: Grace to you, and peace, from him who being, and who was, and who coming; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne.
And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first born from the dead, and the chief of the kings of the earth. To him having loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood,
And he made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him the glory and strength for the times of times.
Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they who goaded him: and all the tribes of the earth shall lament on account of him. Yes, Amen.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord, who being, and who was, and who coming, the Omnipotent Ruler.
I John, and your brother, and partaker in pressure, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, I was in the island called Patmos, for the sake of the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
I was in the Spirit In the day pertaining to the Lord, and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying,
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the seven churches which in Asia; to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
And I turned back to see the voice which spake with me. And having turned back, I saw seven gold chandeliers;
And in the midst of the seven chandeliers one like to the Son of man, dressed in a garment descending to the feet, and girded at the breast with a golden girdle.
And his head and hairs white as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire;
And his feet as brass of Lebanon, as refined by fire in a furnace; and his voice as the voice of many waters.
And having in his right hand seven stars: and going out of his mouth a sharp two-mouthed sword: and his sight as the sun shines in his power.
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he put his right hand upon me, saying to me, Be not afraid; I am the first and the last:
And he living, and I was dead; and, behold, I am living for the times of times, Amen; and have the keys of hades and of death.
Write the things thou hast seen, and which are, and which are about to be after these things;
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest upon my right hand, and the seven golden chandeliers. The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches: and the seven chandeliers which thou sawest are the seven churches.
To the messenger of the Ephesian church write: Thus says he holding the seven stars in his right hand, he walking about in the midst of the seven golden chandeliers;
I know thy works, and thy fatigue, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear the wicked: and thou hast tried them saying they are sent, and are not, and thou Last found them liars:
And thou hast borne, and thou hast patience, and for my name hast thou been wearied, and thou hast not been broken by toil.
But I have against thee, for thou hast let go thy first love.
Therefore remember whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; and if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will move the chandelier out of its place, except thou repent.
But this hast thou, that thou dost hate the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him conquering I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the pleasure garden of God.
And to the messenger of the church of the Smyrnians write; Thus says the first and the last, who was dead and he lived;
I know thy works, and pressure, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and the blasphemy of them saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but the synagogue of the adversary.
Neither be afraid of what things thou art about to suffer: behold, the accuser is about to cast of you into prison, that ye might be tried; and ye shall have pressure ten days: be thou faithful until death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; He conquering should not be injured by the second death.
And to the messenger to the calling out in Pergamos write: Thus says he having the sharp two-mouthed sword;
I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan: and thou holdest my name, and hast not denied my faith, and in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness, who was slain with you, where Satan dwells.
But I have a few things against thee, for thou hast there them holding the teaching of Balsam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
So also hast thou them holding the teaching of the Nicolaitanes, which I hate.
Repent; and if not, I come to thee swiftly, and will wage war with them with the sword of my mouth.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him conquering will I give to eat from the hidden manna, and I will give him a white small stone, and upon the small stone a new name written, which none knew except he receiving.
And to the messenger of the church among the Thyatirians write; Thus says the Son of God, having his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet like the brass of Lebanon;
I know thy works, and love, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last more than the first.
But I have a few things against thee, for thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, calling herself a prophetess, to teach and to lead my servants astray to commit fornication, and to eat things offered to idols.
And I gave her time that she might repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them committing adultery with her into great pressure, except they repent of their works.
And her children will I kill in death; and all the churches shall know that I am he searching the reins and hearts: and I will give to you each according to our works.
And say to you, and to the rest among the Thyatirians, as many as have not this teaching, and who know not the burden of Satan, as they say; I will cast no other burden upon you.
But what ye have, hold ye until I come.
And he conquering, and keeping my works till the end, I will give him power over the nations:
And he will rule them with an iron rod; as vessels of earthen-ware shall they be rubbed together: as I also have received of my Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the messenger of the church in Sardis write: Thus says he having the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead:
Be watching, and make firm the remaining things, which are about to die: For I have not found thy works perfected before God.
Remember therefore how thou hast received, and heard, and do thou, and repent. If therefore thou watch not, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I shall come upon thee.
Thou hast a few names also in Sardis which stained not their garments; and they shall walk about with me in white things: for they are worthy.
He conquering, the same shall be surrounded in white garments; and I will not wipe out his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his messengers.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write; Thus says the holy, the true, he having the key of David, he opening, and no one shuts; and he shuts, and no one opens;
I know thy works: behold, I have given before thee an open door, and none can shut it, for thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of them saying themselves to be Jews, and are not, but they lie; behold, I will make them that they come and worship before thy feet, and they should know that I have loved thee.
For thou didst keep the word of my patience, and I will keep thee from the hour of temptation, about to come upon the whole habitable globe, to try them dwelling upon the earth.
Behold, I come swiftly: hold what thou hast, that none take thy crown.
He conquering, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and without shall he no more come forth: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from my God: and my new name.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; Thus says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor boiling: I would thou shouldest be cold or boiling.
For so thou art tepid, and neither cold nor boiling, I am about to vomit thee out of my month.
For thou sayest, That I am rich, and have abounded, and have need of nothing; and thou knowest not that thou art wretched, and pitiable, and poor, and blind, and naked;
I counsel thee to buy gold of me refined by fire, that thou mightest be rich; and white garments, that thou mightest be surrounded, and that the shame of thy nakedness might not be made manifest; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mightest see.
I, if as many as I love, I rebuke and correct: be emulous therefore, and repent.
Behold, I stand before the door, and knock: and if any hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
He conquering, will I give to him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered, and sat down with my Father on his throne.
He having ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
After these things I saw, and, behold, a door opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me; saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what things must be after these.
And instantly I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne.
And he sitting was like the vision to a jasper stone and a sardine; and a rainbow round about the throne, like the vision to an emerald.
And round about the throne twenty-four thrones; and sitting upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders, surrounded with white garments; and they had golden crowns upon their heads.
And from the throne go forth lightnings, and thunders, and voices: and seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
And before the throne a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
And the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as a man, and the fourth living creature like a spreading eagle.
And the four living creatures, one by itself, had six wings together round about; and within full of eyes; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who was, and who being, and who coming.
And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to him sitting on the throne, and to him living forever and ever,
The twenty-four elders will fall before him sitting on the throne, and will worship him living forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou didst create all things, and by thy will they are, and they were created.
And I saw upon the right hand of him sitting upon the throne, a book written within and behind, sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?
And none was able in heaven, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look upon it.
And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open and to read the hook, neither to look upon it.
And one of the elders says to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion conquered, he being of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.
And I saw, and, behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.
And he came and took the book from the right hand of him sitting upon the throne.
And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each harps, and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy.
And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wert slain, and didst purchase us to God by thy blood from every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;
And madest us kings and priests to our God: and we shall reign upon the earth.
And I saw, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;
Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and praise.
And every creature which is in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth, and upon the sea, which are, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, praise, and honour, and glory, and strength, for the times of times.
And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell and worshipped him living for the times of times.
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as the voice of thunder, Come and see.
And I saw and behold a white horse: and he sitting upon him having a bow; and a crown was given to him: and he went forth conquering, and that he might conquer.
And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.
And another horse came forth fiery red: and it was given to him sitting upon him to take peace from the earth, and that they should slaughter one another: and a great sword was given to him.
And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a black horse, and he sitting upon him having a balance in his hand.
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A measure of wheat for a drachma, and three measures of barley for a drachma; and thou shouldest not injure the oil and the wine.
And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.
And I saw, and behold a pale horse: and he sitting above him the name to him Death, and Hades follows with him. And power was given to them to kill upon the fourth of the earth, with sword, and by famine, and by death, and by wild beasts of the earth.
And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of the slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they had:
And they cried with a great voice, saying, Till when, Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood of them dwelling upon earth
And to each were given white robes; and it was said to them, that they should rest for a little time, till also their fellowservants be filled up, about to be killed, as also they.
And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and, behold, there was a great shaking; and the sun was black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon was as blood;
And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts her untimely figs, shaken by a great wind.
And the heaven was separated as a book turned round; and every mount and isle were moved from their places.
And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the rich, and the captains of thousands, and the powerful, and every servant, and every one free, hid themselves in caves and in rocks of the mountains;
And they say to the mountains and rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him sitting upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:
For the great day of his wrath has come; and who can stand?
And after these things I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind blow not upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree.
And I saw another angel having come from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea,
Saying, Injure not the earth, neither the sea, neither the trees, until we should seal the servants of God upon their foreheads.
And I heard the number of the sealed: an hundred and forty-four thousand sealed of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand sealed.
Of the tribe of Aser twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Nepthalim twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Manasses twelve thousand sealed.
Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand sealed.
Of the tribe of Zabulon twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand sealed. Of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed.
After these things I saw, and, behold, a great multitude, which none could number it, of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, having put round white robes, and palm trees in their hands;
And crying with a great voice, saying, Salvation to our God sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb.
And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshipped God,
Saying, Amen: praise, and glory, and wisdom, and gratitude, and honour, and power, and strength, to our God for ever and ever. Amen.
And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These having put round white robes, who are they? and whence came they.
And I said to him, Lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they coming out of great pressure, and they washed their robes, and whitened their robes in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he sitting upon the throne will dwell among them.
They shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more; nor should the sun fall upon them, neither any heat.
For the Lamb in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall guide them to living fountains of water: and God shall wipe out every tear from their eyes.
And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.
And another angel came and was placed by the altar, having a golden censer; and many perfumes were given him, that he might give to the prayers of the holy upon the golden altar before the throne.
And the smoke of the perfumes went up, with the prayers of the holy, from the angel's hand before God.
And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast into the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.
And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound the trumpets.
And the first angel sounded the trumpet, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast into the earth: and a third of the trees were burned down, and all green grass was burned down.
And the second angel sounded the trumpet, and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third of the sea was blood;
And the third of the creatures which in the sea, died, those having souls; and the third of the ships were destroyed.
And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning as a torch, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;
And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third of the waters is into wormwood; and many of men died of the waters, for they were rendered bitter.
And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third of the sun was stricken, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars; that a third of them might be darkened, and the day shone not, a third of it, and the night likewise.
And I saw, and heard one angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them dwelling upon earth from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels, about to sound the trumpet!
And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth: and there was given to him the key of the well of the bottomless pit.
And he opened the well of the bottomless pit; and a smoke went up out of the well, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the well.
And out of the smoke came forth locusts into the earth: and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the earth, neither any green, nor any tree; except the men only which have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.
And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tortured five months: and their torture as the torture of a scorpion, when he should strike a man.
And in those days shall men seek death, and not find it; and shall eagerly desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
And the likenesses of the locusts like horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as men's faces.
And they had hair as women's hair, and their teeth were as of lions.
And they had coats of mail, as coats of mail of iron; and the voice of their wings as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war.
And they have tails as scorpions, and goads were in their tails: and their power to injure men five months.
And they have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, the name to him in Hebrew Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
One woe has passed; behold, there come two woes more after these.
And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels bound in the great river Euphrates.
And the four angels were loosed, prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they might kill the third of men.
And the number of troops of cavalry, two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard their number.
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them sitting upon them, having fiery coats of mail, and of deep purple, and sulphurous: and the horses' heads as lions' heads; and out of their mouths went forth fire and smoke and sulphur.
By these three were the third of men killed, from fire, and from smoke, and from brimstone, coming forth out of their mouths.
For their powers are in their month, and in their tails: for their tails like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.
And the rest of men who were not killed by these blows, neither repented of the works of their hands, that they should not worship evil spirits, and images of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood: which neither can see, neither hear, neither walk:
And they repented not of their slaughters, nor of their charms, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.
And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, surrounded with a cloud: and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
And he had in his hand a small book opened: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth,
And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars: and when he cried, the seven thunders spake their voices.
And when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal what the seven thunders spake, and thou mayest not write these.
And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon earth lifted up his hand to heaven,
And sware by him living for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and all in it, and earth, and all things in it, and the sea, and all in it, that time shall be no more:
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he should be about to sound the trumpet, and the mystery of God should be finished, as he announced the good news to his servants the prophets.
And the voice which I heard from heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book opened in the hand of the angel having stood upon the sea and upon the earth.
And I came forth to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it up; and it shall render thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth shall it be sweet as honey.
And I took the small book from the angel's hand, and I was eating it; and in my mouth was as honey, sweet: and when I ate it, my belly was bitter.
And he says to me, Thou must again prophesy to peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.
And a reed was given me like rod: and the messenger stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them worshipping in it.
And the court-yard that without the temple throw out, and thou mayest not measure it: for it was given to the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.
And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, surrounded with sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees, and the two chandeliers which having stood before the God of the earth.
And if any would injure them, fire goes forth out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any would injure them, so must he be put to death.
These have power to shut up heaven, that the rain should not wet in the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every blow, as often as they wish.
And when they should finish their testimony, the wild beast coming up out of the abyss shall wage war with them, and shall conquer them, and kill them.
And their slain bodies upon the spacious way of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
And they from the people and tongues and nations shall see their slain bodies three days and a half, and they shall not suffer their slain bodies to be put into tombs.
And they dwelling upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall be gladdened, and shall send gifts to one another; for these two prophets tortured them dwelling upon the earth.
And after three days and a half the Spirit of life from God came upon them, and they stood upon their feet: and great fear fell upon those beholding them.
And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they went up to heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
And in that hour was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and there were slain in the shaking seven thousand names of men: and the rest were terrified, and they gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe passed away; behold, the third woe comes swiftly.
And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet; and great voices were in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of the world were our Lord's, and his Christ's; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
And the twenty four elders, which before God sitting upon their thrones, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
Saying, We return thanks to thee, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who being, and who was, and who coming; for thou hast taken thy great power, and reigned.
And the nations were angry, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the holy, and to them fearing thy name, the small and great; and to destroy them destroying the earth.
And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and shakings, and great hail.
And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman surrounded by the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:
And having in the womb she cries, having the pains of childbirth, and making trial to bring forth.
And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.
And his tail draws the third of the stars of heaven, and he cast them into the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that when she should bring forth he might devour her child.
And she brought forth a son, a male, who is about to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her child was snatched up to God, and his throne.
And the woman fled into the desert where she has a place prepared from God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
And war was in heaven; and Michael and his angels waged war against the dragon; and the dragon waged war and his angels,
And were not strong; nor was place more found for them in heaven.
And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, he deceiving the whole habitable globe: he was cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
And I heard a great voice saying in heaven, Now was salvation and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren was cast down, he accusing them before our God, day and night.
And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their souls till death.
For this rejoice, ye heavens, and they dwelling in them. Woe to them inhabiting the earth and the sea! for the devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.
And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he drove out the woman who brought forth the male.
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly to the desert, to her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
And the serpent cast after the woman water out of his mouth as a river, that he might make her torn away by a river.
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed down the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.
And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went out to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw coming up from the sea a wild beast, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.
And the wild beast which I saw was like a panther, and his feet as of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his throne, and great authority.
And I saw one of his heads as slaughtered to death; and his deathblow was healed: and the whole earth wondered after the beast.
And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the wild beast: and they worshipped the wild beast, saying, Who like the beast? who shall be able to war with him.
And a mouth was given him speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given him to make war forty-two months.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tent, and them dwelling in heaven.
And it was given him to make war with the holy, and to conquer them: and power was given him over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.
And all they dwelling upon earth shall worship him, whose names have not been written in the book of life of the slain Lamb from the foundation of the world.
If any have an ear, let him hear.
If any bring together to captivity he shall proceed into captivity: if any shall kill with sword, he shall be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and faith of the holy.
And I saw another wild beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.
And all the powers of the first beast he does before him, and he makes the earth and all dwelling in it that they should worship the first wild beast, whose death-blow was healed.
And he does great signs, that also he might make fire come down from heaven to the earth before men,
And he deceives them dwelling upon earth by the signs which were given him to do before the wild beast; saying to them dwelling upon earth, to make an image to the wild beast, who has the blow of the sword, and he lived.
And it was given him to give spirit to the image of the wild beast, that the image of the wild beast might speak, and might make as many as should not worship the image of the wild beast that they be killed.
And he makes all, small and great, and rich and poor, and free and servants, that he should give them a stamp upon their right hand, or upon their foreheads:
And that no one could buy or sell, except he having the stamp, or the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him having intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number Six hundred and sixty-six.
And I saw, and, behold, a Lamb standing upon mount Sion, and with him a hundred forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father written in their foreheads.
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder: and I heard the voice of harp players playing on their harps:
And they sing as a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and none could learn the song, except the hundred forty-four thousand, purchased from the earth.
There are they who were not contaminated by women; for they are virgins. These are they following the Lamb wherever he should lead. These were purchased from men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.
And guile was not found in their mouth: for they are blameless before the throne of God.
And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the lasting good news to announce to them dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
Saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship ye him having made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.
And another angel followed, saying, She fell, Babylon fell, the great city, for all nations has she given to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
And the third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If any worship the wild beast and his image, and receive the stamp upon his forehead, or upon his hand,
And the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mingled pure in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tortured in fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the Lamb:
And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever: and they have no rest day and night, those worshipping the wild beast and his image, and if any receive the stamp of his name.
Here is the patience of the holy: here they keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.
And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Happy the dead who dying in the Lord from henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they might cease from their fatigues; and their works follow with them.
And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud he sitting like the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
And another angel went forth out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him sitting upon the cloud, Send thy sickle, and reap: for the hour has come to thee to reap; for the earth's harvest was dried up.
And he sitting upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
And another angel came forth out of the temple which in heaven, the same also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came forth from the altar, having power over fire; and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and harvest the grapes of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes were fully ripe.
And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and harvested the earth's vineyard, and cast into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
And the winepress was trodden under foot without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses' bridles, from sixteen hundred stadia.
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels having the seven last blows; for in them was the wrath of God finished.
And I saw as a sea made of glass mingled with fire: and they conquering from the wild beast, and from his image, and from his stamp, and from the number of his name, standing upon the sea made of glass, having harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful thy works, O Lord God, Omnipotent Ruler; just and true thy ways, King of the holy.
Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou alone holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy justices were made manifest.
And after these things I saw, and behold, the temple of the tent of testimony was opened in heaven:
And the seven angels came forth out of the temple, having the seven blows, clothed in linen, pure and shining, and being girded about the breasts with golden girdles.
And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, living forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none could come into the temple, till the seven blows of the seven angels were finished.
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saving to the seven angels, Go forward, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God in the earth.
And the first went forth, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and a bad and evil sore was upon the men having the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image.
And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea; and it was blood as of a dead body: and every living soul died in the sea.
And the third angel poured out his vial into the rivers, and into the fountains of waters; and it was blood.
And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Just, O Lord, art thou, who being, and who was, and who wilt be, for thou didst judge these things.
For they poured out the blood of the holy, and of the prophets, and thou didst give them blood to drink i for they are worthy.
And I heard another from the altar saying, Yes, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, true and just thy judgments.
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and it was given him to parch up men with fire.
And men were parched up with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God, having power over these blows: and they repented not to give him glory.
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the wild beast; and his kingdom was darkened; and they pressed their tongues for pain,
And they blasphemed the God of heaven for their pains and for their sores, and they repented not of their work.
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings of the risings of the sun might be prepared.
And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the wild beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
For they are the spirits of demons, doing signs, to go out upon all the kings of the earth and of the whole habitable globe, to gather them together for the war of that great day of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.
(Behold, I come as a thief. Happy he watching, and keeping his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.)
And he gathered them together in a place called in Hebrew Armageddon.
And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and a great voice went out from the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great shaking, such as was not since the time men were upon earth, such a great shaking.
And the great city was in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.
And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
And great hail, as the weight of a talent, comes down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the blow of the hail; for its blow is exceedingly great.
And one of the seven angels having the seven vials, came and spake with me, saying to me, Come; I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot sitting upon many waters:
With whom the kings of the earth were debauched, and they dwelling upon the earth were intoxicated from the wine of her harlotry.
And he brought me away in the spirit into the desert: and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet wild beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman surrounded with purple and scarlet, and covered with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the impurity of her harlotry:
And upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS, AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
And I saw the woman intoxicated from the blood of the holy, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus: and I wondered, seeing her, with great wonder.
And the angel said to me, Why didst thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the wild beast lifting her up, having seven heads and ten horns.
The wild beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up from the abyss, and go forward to perdition: and they dwelling upon the earth shall wonder, whose names have not been written upon the book of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the wild beast that was, and is not, although he is.
Here the mind having wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, where the woman sits upon them.
And there are seven kings: five fell, and one is; the other has not yet come; and when he should come, he must remain a little.
And the wild beast which was, and is not, and this is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes forward into perdition.
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which took not yet the kingdom; but take power as kings one hour with the beast.
These have one purpose, and their power and authority will they transmit to the wild beast.
These will wage war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they with him called, and chosen, and faithful.
And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the wild beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and they shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her in fire.
For God gave to their hearts to do his purpose, and to do one purpose, and to give their kingdom to the wild beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.
And the woman which thou sawest is the great city, having kingdom over the kings of the earth.
And after these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was enlightened from his glory.
And he cried with a great, strong voice, saying, She fell, Babylon the great fell, and became the dwelling of devils, and the prison of every unclean spirit, and the prison of every unclean and detested bird.
For of the wrath of the wine of her fornication have all nations drunk, and the kings of the earth were debauched with her, and the wholesale merchants of the earth were rich from the power of her luxury.
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye partake not of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
For her sins were followed even to heaven, and God remembered her injustices.
Give back to her as also she gave back to you, and double to her double things according to her works: in the cup in which she mixed, mix to her double.
As much as she glorified herself, and led an insolent life, give her so much torture and grief: for in her heart she says, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and I should see no grief.
Therefore in one day shall her blows come, death, and grief, and famine; and she shall be burned down in fire: for strong the Lord God judging her.
And weep for her, and lament over her, shall the kings of the earth having been debauched with her, and having led an insolent life, when they see the smoke of her burning,
Standing from far off for fear of her torture, saying, Woe, woe, the great city Babylon, the strong city! for in one hour thy judgment came.
And the wholesale merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for their cargo will none purchase more:
The cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all fir wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of precious wood, and of iron, and brass, and marble,
And cinnamon, and perfumes, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and the finest wheat flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots, and of bodies, and of souls of men,
And the harvest fruit of the eager desire of thy soul departed from thee, and all fat and brilliant things departed from thee, and thou shouldest find them no more.
The wholesale merchants of these things, having been rich from her, shall stand from far off for fear of her torture, weeping and mourning,
And saying, Woe, woe, the great city, surrounded with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! for in one hour was so great riches laid waste.
And every pilot, and all the crowd upon ships, and the sailors, and as many as work the sea, stood from far off,
And cried, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What like the great city!
And they cast earth upon their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all having ships in the sea were rich by her value! for in one hour was she rendered a desert.
Rejoice over her, O heaven, and the holy sent, and the prophets; for God judged your judgment of her.
And one strong angel lifted up a stone as a great millstone, and cast into the sea, saying, Thus with excitement shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and be found no more.
And the voice of harp players, and musicians, and flute players, and trumpeters, should be heard in thee no more; and every artist of every art be found no more in thee; and the voice of the millstone should be heard no more in thee;
And the light of the lamp no more should shine in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, should no more be beard in thee: for thy wholesale merchants were leaders of the earth: for with thy charms were all nations led astray.
And in her was found the blood of the prophets, and of the holy, and of all those slain upon the earth.
And after these things I heard the great voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, to the Lord our God:
For true and just his judgments: for he judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her harlotry, and he avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.
And the second time they said, Alleluia. And her smoke goes up for ever and ever.
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell and worshipped God sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.
And a voice from the throne came out, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, and they fearing him, also small and great.
And I heard as the voice of the vast multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, reigned.
Let us rejoice, and be transported with joy, and let us give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb came, and his wife prepared herself.
And it was given her that she put on fine linen, pure and shining: for fine linen is the justification of the holy.
And he says to me, Write, Happy they called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God.
And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See, not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren having the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he sitting upon him called Faithful and True, and in justice he judges and makes war.
And his eyes as a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, except himself.
And surrounded with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
And out of his mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it he might strike the nations: and he shall rule them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath and anger of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.
And he has upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.
And I saw one angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves to the supper of the great God;
That ye might eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of the strong, and the flesh of horses, and of them sitting upon them, and the flesh of all, free and servants, and of small and great.
And I saw the wild beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to war with him sitting upon the horse, and with his army.
And the wild beast was seized, and with him the false prophet having done signs before him, with which he deceived them having received the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image. Living, were they two cast into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.
And the rest were killed by the sword of him sitting upon the horse, coming out of his mouth: and all birds were satiated from their flesh.
And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.
And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,
And he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and affixed a seal above him, that he should no more deceive the nations, until the thousand years be finished: and after these things he must be loosed a little time.
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given them: and the souls of them beheaded with an axe for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who worshipped not the wild beast, nor his image, and took not the stamp upon their foreheads, and upon their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
And the rest of the dead returned not again to life even till the thousand years be finished. This the first rising up.
Happy and holy he having a part in the first rising up: over these has the second death no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.
And when the thousand years should be finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,
And he shall go forth to deceive the nations that in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war: whose number as the sand of the sea.
And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and they surrounded the camp of the holy, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.
And the devil deceiving them was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where are the wild beast and false prophet, and they shall be tortured day and night for ever and ever.
And I saw a great white throne, and him sitting upon it, from the face of whom the earth and the heaven fled; and there was found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is of life: and the dead were judged from the things written in the books, according to their works.
And the sea gave the dead in it; and death and hades gave the dead in them: and they were judged each one according to their works.
And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and first earth passed away; and the sea was no more.
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
And I heard a great voice from heaven saying, Behold the tent of God with men, and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God.
And God shall wipe out every tear from their eyes; and death be no more, neither grief, neither crying, nor trouble shall be more: for the first things departed.
And he sitting upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says to me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
And he said to me, It has been. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him thirsting of the fountain of the water of life gratuitously.
He conquering shall inherit all things; and I will be God to him, and he shall be son to me.
But to the cowardly, and unbelieving, and to the abominable, and murderers, and to fornicators, and charmers, and to idolaters, and to all the lying, their part in the lake burning with fire and sulphur: which is the second death,
And there came to me one of the seven angels having the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
And he brought me away in the spirit upon a mountain great and high, and showed me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
Having the glory of God: and her luminary like a most precious stone, as jasper stone, shining like crystal;
And having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and the names inscribed, which are of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
From the sunrising three gates; from the north three gates; from the south three gates; and from the sun-setting three gates.
And the wall of the city having twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve sent of the Lamb.
And he speaking with me had a golden reed that he might measure the city, and her gates, and her wall.
And the city lies quadrangular, and her length is so large, such also the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, at twelve thousand stadia. Her length, breadth, and height are equal.
And he measured her wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is the angel.
And the interior construction of her wall was a jasper: and the city pure gold, like pure crystal.
And the foundations of the wall of the city adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation a jasper; the second, a sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth an emerald:
The fifth, a sardonyx; the sixth, a sardius; the seventh, a chrysolyte; the eighth, a beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a hyacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.
And the twelve gates twelve pearls; each one of the gates was of one pearl: and the broad way of the city pure gold, as transparent amber.
And a temple saw I not in her: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, is the temple and the Lamb.
And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they shine in her: for the glory of God enlightened her, and her light the Lamb.
And the nations of the saved shall walk about in her light: and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into her.
And her gates should not be shut by day: for no night shall be there.
And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into her.
And there came not into her anything common, and any doing abomination, and a lie: but they written in the book of life of the Lamb.
And he showed me the pure river of the water of life, shining as crystal, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
In the midst of her broad way and of the river, hence and thence, the tree of life, making twelve fruits, in a month each one returning its fruit: and the leaves of the tree for the cure of the nations.
And there shall be no more curse: and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in her; and his servants shall serve him:
And they shall see his face; and his name upon their foreheads.
And night shall not be there; and they have no need of a lamp, and the light of the sun; for the Lord God shall enlighten them: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
And he said to me, These words faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants what must be with speed.
Behold, I come quickly: happy he keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.
And I John seeing these things, and hearing. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel pointing out to me these things.
And he says to me, See, not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them keeping the words of the prophecy of this book; worship God.
And he says to me, Thou mayest not seal the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is near.
He being unjust, let him be unjust yet: and he being filthy, let him be filthy yet: and the just, let him do justice yet: and the holy, let him be holy yet.
And behold, I come swiftly; and my reward with me, to give back to each as shall be his work.
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
Happy they doing his commands, that their power shall be in the tree of life, and they might come in at the gates to the city.
And without, dogs, and charmers and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and every one loving and doing a lie.
I Jesus sent mine angel to testify these things to you, to the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the shining and morning star.
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him hearing say, Come. And let him thirsting come. And let him wishing, take the water of life freely.
For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book, If any add to these things, God will add to him the blows written in this book:
And if any take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the book of life, and from the holy city, and from the things written in this book.
He testifying says, Yes, I come swiftly. Amen. Yes, come, Lord Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.
