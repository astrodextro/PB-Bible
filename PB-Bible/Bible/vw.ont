In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void, with darkness on the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
Then God said, Let there be light! And there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided between the light and darkness.
God called the light, Day; and the darkness He called, Night. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day One.
Then God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, separating the waters from the waters.
And God made the firmament, and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: thus.
And God called the firmament, Heavens. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Two.
Then God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear: thus.
And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters He called, Seas. And God saw that it was good.
And God said, Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and the fruit tree producing fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth: thus.
And the earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to its kind, and the tree producing fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Three.
Then God said, Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heavens, to distinguish the day from the night; and let them be for signs and seasons, and for days and years;
and let them be for luminaries in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth: thus.
And God made two great luminaries: the greater luminary to rule the day, and the lesser luminary to rule the night, and also the stars.
And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to shine upon the earth,
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Four.
Then God said, Let the waters swarm with swarming living creatures, and let flying creatures fly to and fro above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.
So God created great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, that swarmed in the waters according to their kind, and every winged flying creature according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the flying creatures multiply on the earth.
Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Five.
Then God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: beasts, creeping things and living things of the earth, each according to its kind: thus.
And God made the living things of the earth according to its kind, beasts according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
Then God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over the beasts, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that moves on the earth.
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the flying creatures of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.
And God said, Behold, I have given you every plant that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.
Also, to every living thing of the earth, to every flying creature of the heavens, and to everything that moves on the earth, living creatures, I have given the green plants for food: thus.
And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was extremely good. Thus, the evening and the morning: Day Six.
Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.
And on the seventh day God completed His work which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
And God blessed the seventh day and consecrated it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.
These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God was making the earth and the heavens,
before any shrub of the field was on the earth and before any green plant of the field had sprouted; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground;
but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.
And out of the ground Jehovah God made to sprout every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The Tree of Life was also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four heads.
The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Havilah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good. Bdellium and the onyx stone are there.
The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which circles around all the land of Cush.
The name of the third river is Tigris; it is the one going toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river is Euphrates.
Then Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat to feed;
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die the death.
And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper to complement him.
Out of the ground Jehovah God formed every living thing of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
So the man gave names to all the animals, to the flying creatures of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field. But for the man there was not found a helper to complement him.
And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
And the rib which Jehovah God had taken out of the man He rebuilt into a woman, and He brought her to the man.
And the man said: This now at last is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
Therefore a man, leaving his father and mother, and having cleaved to his wife, they are one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
Now the serpent was more cunning than any living thing of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Has God indeed said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden;
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.
And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not die the death.
For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as God, knowing good and evil.
So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.
And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings.
And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking around in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.
And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?
And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.
And He said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she has given to me of the tree, and I ate.
And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
So Jehovah God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all beasts, and more than every living thing of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.
To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in pain you shall bring forth children; your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.
And to Adam He said, Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it: Cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.
In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you have been taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.
And the man called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
Also for the man and his wife Jehovah God made tunics of skins, and clothed them.
And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, that he not put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever;
therefore Jehovah God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.
So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the Garden of Eden, and a flaming sword turning this way and that, to guard the way to the Tree of Life.
And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man from Jehovah.
And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel tended flocks, but Cain worked the ground.
And at the end of so many days it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground unto Jehovah.
Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and his offering,
but He did not have regard for Cain and his offering. And Cain’s anger burned greatly, and his countenance fell.
So Jehovah said to Cain, Why does your anger burn? And why has your countenance fallen?
If you do well, is there not exaltation? And if you do not do well, sin is lying at the door. And its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.
Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.
And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? He said, I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?
And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.
And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear!
Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.
And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken upon him sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, so that anyone finding him should not kill him.
And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son: Enoch.
To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.
And Lamech took for himself two wives: the name of one was Adah, and the name of the second was Zillah.
And Adah bore Jabal: He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.
His brother’s name was Jubal: He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute.
And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain: One hammering in every craft of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech! For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for striking me.
If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.
And the man knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name: Seth, for God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel; because Cain killed him.
And as for Seth, to him also a son was born; and he called his name Enosh. Then they began to call upon the name of Jehovah.
This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called their name Mankind in the day when they were created.
And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.
After he begot Seth, the days of Adam were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.
So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.
Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begot Enosh.
After he begot Enosh, Seth lived eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
Enosh lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.
After he begot Cainan, Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Mahalalel.
After he begot Mahalalel, Cainan lived eight hundred and forty years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.
After he begot Jared, Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred and ninety-five years; and he died.
Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch.
After he begot Enoch, Jared lived eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years; and he died.
Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuselah.
After he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God carried him away.
Methuselah lived one hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.
After he begot Lamech, Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
Lamech lived one hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.
And he called his name Noah, saying, This one will comfort us concerning our work and the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed.
After he begot Noah, Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years, and begot sons and daughters.
So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and he died.
And Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were pleasing; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.
And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not continually strive with man, for indeed it is in flesh to sin; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.
There were giants on the earth in those days. And also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them, these were the mighty men from antiquity, men of renown.
And Jehovah saw that the evil of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all day long.
And Jehovah regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved to His heart.
And Jehovah said, I will obliterate man whom I have created from off the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens, for I regret having made them.
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generation. Noah walked with God.
And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them along with the earth.
Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
You shall make a window for the ark, and you shall finish it to a cubit from above; and set the door of the ark in its side. You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.
And behold I, even I, am bringing a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy from under the heavens all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
And I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark; you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.
And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
Of flying creatures after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come in to you, to keep them alive.
And take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.
Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.
And Jehovah said to Noah, Come into the ark, you and all your house, for I have seen you as being righteous before Me in this generation.
You shall take unto you of every clean animal seven and seven, a male and his female; and two each of animals that are not clean, a male and his female;
also seven and seven of the flying creatures of the heavens, male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.
For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will obliterate from off the face of the earth all living substance that I have made.
And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.
Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.
Of clean animals, of animals that are not clean, of flying creatures, and of everything that moves upon the earth,
two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.
And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
On the very same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark;
they and every living thing after its kind, all animals after their kind, every creeping thing that moves on the earth after its kind, and every flying creature after its kind, every bird of every wing.
And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life.
So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him. And Jehovah shut him in.
And the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it was high above the earth.
The waters prevailed and greatly increased upon the earth, and the ark moved about upon the surface of the waters.
And the waters prevailed with abundant force upon the earth, and all the high hills under the heavens were covered.
The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.
And all flesh died that moved on the earth: flying creatures and animals and living things and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and every man.
All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, all that was on the dry land, died.
So He obliterated all living substance which was on the face of the ground: both man and animal, creeping thing and flying creatures of the heavens. They were obliterated from off the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark were left alive.
And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.
The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained.
And the waters receded from the earth, going out and coming back. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were decreased.
And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.
And the waters continued to go and decrease until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
And it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.
And he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from off the earth.
He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from off the face of the ground.
But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself.
And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark.
And the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf was in her mouth; so Noah knew that the waters had receded from off the earth.
So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.
And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was dry.
And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.
And God spoke to Noah, saying,
Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.
Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: flying creatures and animals and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, so that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.
So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.
Every living thing, every creeping thing, every flying creature, and everything that moves on the earth, according to their kind, went out of the ark.
And Noah built an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
And Jehovah smelled a soothing aroma. And Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground because of man, although the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; nor will I again smite every living thing as I have done.
While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every living thing of the earth, upon every flying creature of the heavens, upon everything that moves on the earth, and upon all the fish of the sea. They have been entrusted into your hand.
Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have designated all things for you, even as the green plants.
But you shall not eat flesh with its soul, that is, its blood.
Surely the blood of your souls will I require; at the hand of every living thing will I require it, and at the hand of man. At the hand of every man’s brother I will require the soul of man.
Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God He made man.
And as for you, be fruitful and multiply; swarm in the earth and multiply in it.
And God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:
And as for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,
and with every living creature that is with you: the flying creatures, the animals, and every living thing of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every living thing of the earth.
Thus I have established My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.
And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.
It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud;
and I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it to remember the perpetual covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.
These three were the sons of Noah, and from these they scattered throughout the whole earth.
And Noah began to be a man of the land, and he planted a vineyard.
Then he drank of the wine and was drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backward, and they did not see the nakedness of their father.
And Noah awoke from his wine, and perceived what his younger son had done to him.
And he said: Cursed is Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brethren.
And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.
The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
From these the regions of the nations were separated into their lands, everyone according to their tongue, according to their families, into their nations.
The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah; therefore it is said, Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before Jehovah.
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
From that land he went forth to Assyria and built Nineveh, the city of Rehoboth and Calah,
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah, which was a large city.
Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;
the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite;
the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;
the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were scattered.
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands and in their nations.
And to Shem also, the older brother of Japheth, and father of all the sons of Eber, sons were born.
The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber.
To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.
And their dwelling place was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, a mountain in the east.
These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.
These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.
Now the whole earth was of one language and one speech.
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a level valley in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
Then they said to one another, Come, let us make bricks and burn them with burning. They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.
And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, that we not be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.
And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built.
And Jehovah said, Behold, the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they devise to do will be withheld from them.
Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they cannot understand one another’s speech.
So Jehovah scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.
Therefore its name is called Babel, because there Jehovah confused the language of all the earth; and from there Jehovah scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood.
After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah.
After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.
After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.
Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg.
After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.
Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.
After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.
Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug.
After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.
Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.
After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.
Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah.
After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.
Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
These are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran begot Lot.
And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
And Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran and dwelt there.
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
Now Jehovah said to Abram: Depart from your land, from your kindred and from your father’s house, to a land that I will show you.
I will make of you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing.
I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who despises you; and in you all families of the earth shall be blessed.
So Abram departed as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran.
And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had collected, and the souls they had acquired in Haran, and they departed to go into the land of Canaan. So they came into the land of Canaan.
And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land.
And Jehovah appeared to Abram and said, To your seed I will give this land. And there he built an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared to him.
And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent with Bethel toward the sea and Ai on the east. There he built an altar unto Jehovah and called upon the name of Jehovah.
And Abram journeyed, proceeding to journey toward the south.
Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was heavy in the land.
And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at.
And it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, This is his wife; and they will kill me, but they will let you live.
Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and my soul shall live because of you.
And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.
The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
He dealt well with Abram because of her; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.
And Jehovah struck Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife.
And Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
Why did you say, She is my sister? And so I took her to be my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take her and depart.
And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.
And Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
And Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.
And he went on his journey from the South as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,
to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abram called upon the name of Jehovah.
Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.
And the land was not able to support them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together.
And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.
And Abram said to Lot, Please let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we men are brothers.
Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or, if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.
And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the area around Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere (before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah) like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt as you go toward Zoar.
Then Lot chose for himself all the area around Jordan, and Lot journeyed east. And they separated each from the other.
Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt around the cities, and pitched his tent even as far as Sodom.
But the men of Sodom were exceedingly evil and sinful before Jehovah.
And after Lot had separated from him, Jehovah said to Abram: Lift up your eyes now and look from the place where you are, northward, southward, eastward, and westward;
for all the land which you see I give to you and your seed in perpetuity.
And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then your seed also could be numbered.
Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you.
Then Abram moved his tent, and went and dwelt by the plain of Mamre in Hebron, and built an altar there unto Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations,
that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar).
All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and struck the giants in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kirjathaim,
and the Horites in their mountains of Seir, as far as El Paran, which is by the wilderness.
Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (which is Kadesh), and struck all the land of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.
And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar) went out and set in battle array in the Valley of Siddim
against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of nations, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against five.
Now the Valley of Siddim was pitted with asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; some fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains.
And they took all the property of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
They also took Lot, the son of Abram’s brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and his possessions, and departed.
And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt by the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and they were allies with Abram.
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led out his trained three hundred and eighteen who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
And they split up by night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
And he brought back all the property, and also brought back his brother Lot and his possessions, as well as the women and the people.
And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (which is the King’s Valley), after his return from smiting Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him.
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; and he was the priest of the Most High God.
And he blessed him and said: Blessed is Abram of the Most High God, Possessor of Heaven and earth;
and blessed is the Most High God, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him a tithe of all.
And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the souls, and take the property for yourself.
But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have raised my hand to Jehovah the Most High God, possessor of the heavens and earth,
that I will take nothing, from a thread to a sandal strap, and that I will not take anything that is yours, that you may not say, I have made Abram rich;
except only what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
After these things the Word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.
And Abram said, Lord Jehovah, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the son of the inheritance of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
And Abram said, Behold, You have given me no seed; and lo, a son of my house inherits from me.
And behold, the Word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This one shall not inherit from you, but one who shall come forth from your own body shall inherit from you.
And He brought him outside and said, Look now toward the heavens, and count the stars if you are able to number them. And He said unto him, So shall your seed be.
And he believed in Jehovah, and He accounted it unto him for righteousness.
And He said unto him, I am Jehovah, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it.
And he said, Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?
And He said unto him, Take for Me a three year old heifer, a three year old female goat, a three year old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
And he took all these for Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and put each piece against each other; but he did not cut the birds in two.
And when the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.
And He said to Abram: Consider to know that your seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.
And I will also judge the nation whom they serve; and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
And as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age.
But in the fourth generation they shall return here; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.
And it came to pass, when the sun had gone down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces.
On that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying: To your seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates;
the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
the Hittites, the Perizzites, the giants,
the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.
And Sarai said to Abram, See now, Jehovah has restrained me from bearing. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall build up a family by her. And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai.
And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maidservant, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan.
And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
And Sarai said to Abram, My injustice be upon you! I gave my maid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes. Jehovah judge between me and you.
But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your maid is in your hand; do to her as is good in your eyes. And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.
And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.
And He said, Hagar, Sarai’s maidservant, where have you come from, and where are you going? She said, I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.
And the Angel of Jehovah said to her, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hand.
And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, so that they shall not be numbered for multitude.
And the Angel of Jehovah said unto her: Behold, you are with child, and you shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah has heard your affliction.
He shall be a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man’s hand against him. And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her, God-Who-Sees; for she said, Have I also here looked upon Him who sees me?
Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi. Behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him, I am the Almighty God! Walk before Me and be perfect;
and I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly abundantly.
And Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying:
As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations.
No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations.
I will make you abundantly exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you.
And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your seed after you in their generations, for a perpetual covenant, to be God unto you and unto your seed after you.
Also I have given unto you and your seed after you the land in which you sojourn, all the land of Canaan, as an enduring possession; and I will be their God.
And God said to Abraham: As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations.
This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your seed after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised;
and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between Me and you.
He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male in your generations, he who is born in the house or bought with money from any son of a foreigner who is not your seed.
He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.
And the uncircumcised male, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.
Then God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.
And I have blessed her and have given you a son by her; yea, I have blessed her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall be from her.
Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall one be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?
And Abraham said to God, Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!
And God said: Truly, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I have established My covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, with his seed after him.
And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly abundantly. He shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.
But My covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this set time next year.
And He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
And Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins the same day, as God had spoken unto him.
And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
In the same day Abraham was circumcised, along with his son Ishmael;
and all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from the son of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
And Jehovah appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent opening in the heat of the day.
And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent opening to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground,
and said, My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your eyes, do not pass on by Your servant.
Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
And I will bring a morsel of bread, that you may strengthen your hearts. After that you may pass on, for this is why you have passed along by your servant. They said, Do as you have said.
So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead it and make cakes.
And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave it to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it.
And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree. And they ate.
And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? So he said, Here, in the tent.
And He said, I will come back to return to you according to the time of life, and behold, Sarah your wife shall have a son. And Sarah was listening from the tent opening which was behind him.
Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; and it had ceased to be after the manner of women with Sarah.
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, Being worn out, shall I be delighted, my lord, having also become old?
And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why has Sarah laughed, saying, Shall I surely give birth, I who have become old?
Is anything beyond the power of Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
But Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.
And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them to send them on the way.
And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing,
since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
For I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his house after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken to him.
And Jehovah said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is exceedingly heavy.
I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.
And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before Jehovah.
And Abraham approached and said, Would You also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous that were in it?
Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
Then Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I who am but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord:
Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for lack of five? And He said, If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.
And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose there should be forty found there? And He said, I will not do it for the sake of forty.
Then he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there? And He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.
And he said, Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of twenty.
And he said, Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there? And He said, I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.
And Jehovah went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.
And the two angels came to Sodom at evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
And he said, Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servant’s house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way. And they said, No, but we will spend the night in the open square.
But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.
And they called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them.
And Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him,
and said, Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly.
See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and do to them as is good in your eyes; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.
And they said, Stand back! And they said, This one came in to sojourn, and he acts as a judge to condemn; now we will deal worse with you than with them. And they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door.
But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door.
And they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door.
And the men said to Lot, Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city; bring them out of this place!
For we are destroying this place, because the outcry against them has grown great before the face of Jehovah, and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.
And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, and said, Get up, get out of this place; for Jehovah is destroying this city! But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking.
And when dawn had risen, the angels urged Lot, saying, Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are found here, that you not be consumed in the punishment of the city.
And while he lingered, the men took hold of his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hands of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him down outside the city.
And it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said, Escape for your lives! Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.
And Lot said to them, Please, no, my lords!
Behold now, your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die.
See now, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one; please let me escape there (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
And he said to him, See, I have favored you concerning this thing also, in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken.
Hurry, escape there! For I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
Then Jehovah rained brimstone and fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah, from Jehovah out of the heavens.
And He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and the plants of the ground.
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.
And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.
And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave.
And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man on the earth to come in to us as is the manner of all the earth.
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may keep alive the seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
And it happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in and lie with him, that we may keep alive the seed of our father.
And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.
Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father.
And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.
And the younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the people of Ammon to this day.
And Abraham journeyed from there to the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is married to a husband.
But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, will You slay a righteous nation also?
Did he not say to me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.
And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For I also withheld you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.
Now therefore, restore the man’s wife; for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore her, know that you shall die the death, you and all who are yours.
So Abimelech rose early in the morning, summoned all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were greatly afraid.
And Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? How have I offended you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will kill me on account of my wife.
And yet she is truly my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall do for me: in every place, wherever we go, say of me, He is my brother.
And Abimelech took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him.
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.
And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver; indeed this vindicates you before all who are with you and before everybody. Thus she was rebuked.
So Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they gave birth;
for Jehovah had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.
And Jehovah visited Sarah as He had said, and Jehovah did for Sarah as He had spoken.
For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah had borne to him, Isaac.
And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
And Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
And Sarah said, God has made laughter for me, and all who hear will laugh with me.
She also said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would suckle a son? For I have borne him a son in his old age.
And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing.
Therefore she said to Abraham, Drive away this maidservant and her son; for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac.
And the matter caused Abraham’s eyes to quiver greatly because of his son.
And God said to Abraham, Do not let your eyes quiver because of the lad or because of your maidservant. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your Seed shall be called.
And I will also make a nation of the son of the maidservant, because he is your seed.
And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs.
And she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, Let me not see the death of the boy. So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept.
And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar out of the heavens, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
Arise, lift up the lad and support him with your hand, for I will make of him a great nation.
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink.
And God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a great archer.
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.
Now therefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.
And Abraham said, I will swear.
But Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants had seized.
And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.
And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
And Abimelech asked Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?
And he said, You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that they may be my witness that I have dug this well.
Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.
Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. So Abimelech rose with Phicol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.
And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called upon the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.
And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.
And He said, Take now your son, your only one Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.
And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
And on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
And Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; and the lad and I will go over there and do homage, and we will come back to you.
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together.
And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering. So the two of them went together.
And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham! Abraham! And he said, Here am I.
And He said, Do not lay your hand upon the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only one from Me.
And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
And Abraham called the name of the place, Jehovah Jireh; as it is said to this day, In the Mount of Jehovah it shall be seen.
And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time out of the heavens,
and said: By Myself I have sworn, says Jehovah, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only one;
that in blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your Seed shall possess the gate of His enemies.
And in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.
So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
And it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor:
Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,
Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
And Sarah died in Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
I am a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead from before my face.
And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
Hear us, my lord: You are a Godly prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead.
And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth.
And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your wish that I bury my dead from before my face, hear me, and entreat Ephron the son of Zohar for me,
that he may give me the cave of Machpelah which he has, which is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you.
And Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, all who entered at the gate of his city, saying,
No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that is in it; I give it to you before the eyes of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead.
And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land;
and he spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, If you will give it, please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take it from me and I will bury my dead there.
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
My lord, listen to me; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver. What is that between you and me? So bury your dead.
And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed out the silver to Ephron which he had spoken in the ears of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants.
And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, which were within all the surrounding borders, were deeded
to Abraham as a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (which is Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
And the field and the cave that is in it were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.
Now Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.
And Abraham said to the oldest servant of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Please, put your hand under my thigh,
and I will make you swear by Jehovah the God of the Heavens and God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;
but you shall go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land; must I take your son back to the land from which you came?
And Abraham said to him, Beware that you do not take my son back there.
Jehovah the God of Heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, To your seed I give this land, He will send His Angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.
And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you have been released from this oath; only, do not take my son back there.
So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.
And the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, for all his master’s goods were in his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw.
And he said, O Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, please cause the meeting before me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
Behold, here I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
Now let it be that the young woman to whom I shall say, Please let down your pitcher that I may drink, and she says, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink; let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And by this I shall know that You have shown kindness to my master.
And it happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder.
And the young woman was of a very pleasant appearance, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up.
And the servant ran to meet her and said, Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.
And she said, Drink, my lord. Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink.
And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.
And she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
And the man, gazing at her, remained silent so as to know whether Jehovah had prospered his journey or not.
And it came to pass, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels of gold,
and said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me, please, is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge?
And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to Nahor.
Moreover she said to him, We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.
And the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Jehovah.
And he said, Blessed be Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His goodness and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master’s brethren.
And the girl ran and told these things in the house of her mother.
And Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well.
And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well.
And he said, Come in, O blessed of Jehovah! Why do you stand outside? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.
And the man came into the house. And he unloaded the camels, and provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
And food was set before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat until I have spoken my business. And he said, Speak.
And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.
Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.
And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old; and to him he has given all that he has.
And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
but you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.
And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.
And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send His Angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father’s house.
Then you shall be free from this oath when you come to my family; and if they will not give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.
And this day I came to the well and said, O Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go,
behold, I am standing by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw water, and I say to her, Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,
and she says to me, Drink, and I will draw for your camels also; let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master’s son.
And before I had finished speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew water. And I said to her, Please let me drink.
And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels water also. So I drank, and she gave the camels water also.
Then I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her hands.
And I bowed and prostrated myself before Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.
And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing has come forth from Jehovah; we cannot speak to you either bad or good.
Behold, Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as Jehovah has spoken.
And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that he prostrated himself to the earth before Jehovah.
And the servant brought out articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
And he and the men who were with him ate and drank and stayed the night. And they arose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
And her brother and her mother said, Let the girl stay with us perhaps ten days; after that she may go.
And he said to them, Do not delay me, since Jehovah has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.
So they said, We will call the girl and ask at her mouth.
And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.
And they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men.
And they blessed Rebekah and said to her: Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands of ten thousands; and may your seed possess the gates of those who hate them.
And Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.
And Isaac came from the gates of Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the land toward the south.
And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, the camels were coming.
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel;
for she had said to the servant, Who is this man walking in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. Therefore she took a veil and covered herself.
And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah; and he took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
Then Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
And the sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had; and while he was still living he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, to the lands to the east.
These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred and seventy-five years.
Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,
the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer Lahai Roi.
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
These were the sons of Ishmael and these were their names, by their villages and their encampments, twelve chiefs according to their nations.
And these were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
They settled from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go toward Assyria. He settled in the presence of all his brethren.
And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac.
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan, the sister of Laban the Aramean, as wife.
And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
But the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If all is right, why am I like this? So she went to inquire of Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to her: Two nations are in your womb, two peoples shall be separated from your body; one people shall be stronger than the other, and the older shall serve the younger.
So when her days were fulfilled for her to give birth, behold, there were twins in her womb.
And the first came out red. He was like a hairy garment all over; and they called his name Esau.
Afterward his brother came out, and his hand took hold of Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
So the boys grew: And Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
And Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
Now Jacob boiled stew; and Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted.
And Esau said to Jacob, Please let me gulp down some of that red, red stew, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.
And Jacob said, Sell me your birthright today.
And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die; so what is this birthright to me?
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day. So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.
And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; and he ate and drank, arose, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.
And Jehovah appeared to him and said: Do not go down into Egypt; dwell in the land of which I shall tell you.
Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your seed I give all these lands. And I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham your father.
And I will make your seed multiply as the stars of the heavens; I will give to your seed all these lands; and in your Seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed;
because Abraham has obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister; for he was afraid to say, She is my wife, thinking, Lest the men of the place kill me on account of Rebekah, because she was of a pleasant appearance.
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
And Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, Behold, surely she is your wife; so why have you said, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I thought, Lest I die on account of her.
And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.
And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall die the death.
Then Isaac sowed in that land, and got in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him.
The man became great, and continued on growing in greatness until he became exceedingly great;
for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. And the Philistines envied him.
Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with dirt.
And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you have become much mightier than we.
So Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
And Isaac re-dug the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. And he called them by the names which his father had called them.
Isaac’s servants also dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there.
But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they had contended with him.
And they dug another well, and they strove over that one also. So he called its name Sitnah.
And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, For now Jehovah has made a large place for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
And he went up from there to Beer-sheba.
And Jehovah appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of your father Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abraham’s sake.
So he built an altar there and called upon the name of Jehovah. And he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.
And Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phicol the commander of his army.
And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?
And they said, We have certainly seen that Jehovah is with you. So we said, Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you,
that you will do us no evil, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace; you being now the blessed of Jehovah.
And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
And they arose early in the morning and swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
And it came to pass on the same day that Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, We have found water.
And he called it Shebah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
And Esau was forty years old when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
And they were a grief of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah.
And it came to pass, when Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, that he summoned Esau his older son and said to him, My son. And he answered him, Here am I.
And he said, Behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death.
Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me.
And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring it.
And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,
Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of Jehovah before my death.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to what I command you.
Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves.
And you shall take it to your father, that he may eat it, and that he may bless you before his death.
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.
And his mother said to him, Let your curse be upon me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.
And he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
And Rebekah took the good clothes of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
And he went in to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who are you, my son?
And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you have spoken to me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.
But Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God brought it to me.
And Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are my very son Esau or not.
And Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.
And he said, Are you really my son Esau? And he said, I am.
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, so that my soul may bless you. So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.
And he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said: Surely, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which Jehovah has blessed.
Therefore, God give you of the dew of the heavens, of the fatness of the earth, and abundance of grain and wine.
Let nations serve you, and people bow down to you. Be lord over your brethren, and let your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed is everyone who curses you, and blessed be those who bless you!
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
And he also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.
And his father Isaac said to him, Who are you? So he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.
And Isaac trembled with a very great trembling, and said, Who? Where is the one who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I have blessed him; and moreover, he shall be blessed.
And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me; me also, O my father!
And he said, Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.
And Esau said, Is he not rightly called by the name Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now behold, he has taken away my blessing! And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?
Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?
And Esau said to his father, Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me; me also, O my father! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
And Isaac his father answered and said to him: Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the heavens from above.
By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass, when you become restless, that you shall break his yoke from your neck.
And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.
And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and summoned Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself concerning you by intending to kill you.
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban, to Haran.
And stay with him some days, until your brother’s fury turns away,
until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?
And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what kind of life is that to me?
And Isaac summoned Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him: You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
Arise, go to Paddan, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take yourself a wife from there of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother.
May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become an assembly of peoples;
and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and your seed with you, that you may inherit the land in which you are a sojourner, which God has given to Abraham.
And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
And when Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan to take himself a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,
and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan;
and Esau also saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of his father Isaac;
that Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife along with the wives he had.
And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.
And he came to a certain place and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of that place and put it at his head, and he lay down in that place to sleep.
And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, and its top reached to the heavens; and behold the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
And behold, Jehovah stood above it and said: I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you are lying I give to you and your seed.
And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I am not forsaking you until I have done what I have spoken to you.
And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not realize it.
And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven!
And Jacob arose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put at his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.
And he called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of that city had formerly been Luz.
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,
so that I return to my father’s house in peace, then Jehovah shall be my God.
And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will tithe to give a tithe to You.
So Jacob lifted his feet and came into the land of the sons of the East.
And he looked, and behold a well in the field; and behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. And a large stone was on the well’s mouth.
And all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth.
And Jacob said to them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.
And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well. And behold, his daughter Rachel is coming with the sheep.
And he said, Behold, it is still high day; it is not the time for cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed them.
But they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.
And while he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was tending them.
And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.
And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s relative and that he was Rebekah’s son. So she ran and told her father.
And it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things.
And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month of days.
And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?
Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
Leah’s eyes were delicate, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a beautiful appearance.
And Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.
And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.
So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were only a day in his eyes because of the love he had for her.
And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my days have been fulfilled.
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.
And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him; and he went in to her.
And Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as a maidservant.
And it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you deceived me?
And Laban said, It is not done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.
Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me yet another seven years.
And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also.
And Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maidservant.
And Jacob also went in to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with him yet another seven years.
When Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.
And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Jehovah has surely looked upon my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.
And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this one also. And she called his name Simeon.
And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.
And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, Now I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she stopped giving birth.
Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel was jealous of her sister, and said to Jacob, Give me sons, or if not I shall die!
And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah; go in to her, and she shall give birth on my knees, that I also may be built up by her.
And she gave him Bilhah her maid as wife, and Jacob went in to her.
And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.
And Rachel said, God has judged my case, and has also heard my voice and given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.
And Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
And Rachel said, With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed. So she called his name Naphtali.
And when Leah saw that she had stopped giving birth, she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as wife.
And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
And Leah said, Good fortune has come! So she called his name Gad.
And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
And Leah said, I am happy, for the daughters shall call me blessed. So she called his name Asher.
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.
And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.
When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for hiring I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.
And Leah said, God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband. So she called his name Issachar.
And Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good endowment; this time my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. So she called his name Zebulun.
And afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
And God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.
And she conceived and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.
So she called his name Joseph, and said, Jehovah shall add to me another son.
And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own land.
Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service with which I have served you.
And Laban said to him, Please stay, if I have found favor in your eyes, for I have observed the signs that Jehovah has blessed me because of you.
And he said, Specify your wages to me, and I will give it.
So Jacob said to him, You know how I have served you and how your livestock is with me.
For what you had before I came was little, and it has increased into a multitude; Jehovah has blessed you since I stepped foot here. And now, when shall I also provide for my own house?
So he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will turn back to feed and keep your flocks:
Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and these shall be my wages.
So my righteousness shall testify for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if it is with me.
And Laban said, Oh, that it were according to your word!
So he removed that day the male goats that were speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had some white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave them into the hand of his sons.
And he put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
And Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and plane trees, peeled white strips in them, and laid bare the white which was in the rods.
And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the troughs, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should come into heat when they came to drink.
And the flocks mated before the rods, and the flocks gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted.
And Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban’s flock.
And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock were in heat, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the troughs, that they might mate among the rods.
And when the flocks were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s.
And the man increased exceedingly greatly, and had many cattle, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
Now Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has acquired all this wealth.
And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not toward him as before.
And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.
So Jacob sent and summoned Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock,
and said to them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
And you know that with all my strength I have served your father.
Yet your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God has not allowed him to do evil to me.
If he said thus: The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore streaked.
So God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
And it happened, at the time when the flocks were in heat, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which mounted the flocks were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
And the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob. And I said, Here am I.
And He said, Lift up your eyes now and see, all the rams which mount the flocks are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and where you vowed a vow to Me. Now arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your kindred.
And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Are we not considered foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and also devoured and consumed our money.
For all these riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our sons’. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.
Then Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.
And he drove away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Paddan, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
And Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the household idols that were her father’s.
And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he was fleeing.
So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and set his face toward the mountains of Gilead.
And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.
And he took his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead.
And God come to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.
So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.
And Laban said to Jacob: What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and led away my daughters like captives of the sword?
Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp?
And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have done foolishly in so doing.
It is in the power of my hand to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Beware that you not speak to Jacob from good to evil.
And now you have proceeded to depart because you have longed for your father’s house. But why have you stolen my gods?
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Lest you would take your daughters from me by force.
With whomever you find your gods, do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take it with you. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent.
Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. And Laban groped all about the tent but did not find them.
And she said to her father, Let it not burn in the eyes of my lord that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is with me. And he searched but did not find the household idols.
And Jacob was furious and complained to Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?
Although you have searched all my things, what of your household articles have you found? Set it here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both!
These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock.
That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. You required it from my hand, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
There I was: In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.
Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.
Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and rebuked you last night.
And Laban answered and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks; all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?
Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and me, and let it be a witness between you and me.
So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.
And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap.
Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between you and me this day. Therefore its name was called Galeed;
also, Mizpah; because he said, May Jehovah watch between you and me when we are hidden (being absent) one from another.
If you afflict my daughters, or if you take other wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us; consider that God is witness between you and me.
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap and this pillar, which I have cast between me and you:
This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a testimony, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for evil.
The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
And Jacob slaughtered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain.
And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and daughters and blessed them. And Laban departed and returned to his place.
So Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother in the land of Seir, the land of Edom.
And he commanded them, saying, Speak thus to my lord Esau, Thus your servant Jacob says: I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now.
And I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.
And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.
And Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies.
For he thought, If Esau comes to the one company and strikes it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah who said to me, Return to your land and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:
I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the faithfulness which You have done for Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two companies.
Rescue me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers to the children.
For You said, I will do good to deal well with you, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
And he lodged there that night, and took what came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put some space from drove to drove.
And he commanded the first one, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose are these before you?
then you shall say, They are your servant Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also is behind us.
And he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, You shall speak these words to Esau when you find him;
and also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he thought, I will propitiate before his face with the present that goes before me, and afterward when I shall see his face, perhaps he will forgive me.
So the present passed over before him, but he himself remained that night in the camp.
And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.
He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had.
And Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the dawn began to rise.
And when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him.
And He said, Let Me go, for the dawn has risen. But he said, I will not let You go unless You bless me!
And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.
And He said, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have persevered with God and with men, and have prevailed.
And Jacob asked, saying, Please tell me Your name. And He said, Why is it that you ask about My name? And He blessed him there.
And Jacob called the name of the place Penuel: For I have seen God face to face, and my soul is delivered.
Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose over him, and he was limping on his thigh.
Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle tendon which is on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s hip on the muscle tendon.
And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.
And he crossed over in front of them and prostrated himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.
Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down.
And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.
And Esau said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the eyes of my lord.
And Esau said, I have abundance, my brother; keep what you have to yourself.
And Jacob said, No, please, if I have now found favor in your eyes, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.
Please, take my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have everything I need. So he urged him, and he took it.
And Esau said, Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.
But Jacob said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds which are nursing are with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die.
Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on gently according to the pace of the livestock that go before me, and the feet of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.
And Esau said, Now let me leave with you some of the people who are with me. But he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan; and he pitched his tent before the city.
And he bought the parcel of land where he had pitched his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money.
And he set up an altar there, and called it, El Elohe Israel.
Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, chief of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her, and humbled her.
And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke to the heart of the girl.
And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get this girl for me as a wife.
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob held his peace until they came.
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.
And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved and extremely furious, because he had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done.
And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves.
And you shall dwell with us, and the land is before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions in it.
And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give.
Ask me ever so much dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the girl as a wife.
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister;
and they said to them: We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us.
But on this condition we will consent to you: If you will become as we are, if every male of you is circumcised,
then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.
And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.
And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. He was more honorable than all the house of his father.
And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying:
These men are peaceable with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land is wide of hands before them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give our daughters to them.
Only on this condition will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they are circumcised.
Shall not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
And all those going out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city in its security and killed every male.
And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and fetched Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went out.
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what was in the city and what was in the field.
All their wealth, all their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that was in the houses.
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and since I am few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my house and I.
And they said, Should he treat our sister like a harlot?
And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to the Mighty God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.
And Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.
Let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to the Mighty God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me in the way which I have gone.
So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree which was by Shechem.
And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.
So Jacob came to Luz (which is Bethel), in the land of Canaan, he and all the people with him.
And he built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from the face of his brother.
Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.
And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Paddan, and blessed him.
And God said to him, Your name is Jacob; your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel shall be your name. And He called his name Israel.
God also said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins.
The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your seed after you I give this land.
And God ascended from him in the place where He had spoken with him.
And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.
And Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.
And they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was still some ground to cover to arrive at Ephrath, Rachel was giving birth, and she had hard labor.
And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Do not fear; you shall have this son also.
And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin.
And Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).
And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.
And Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard about it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
the sons of Leah were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun;
the sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin;
the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, were Dan and Naphtali;
and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan.
And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, to the city of Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.
And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and fulfilled in days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
Now Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel.
And Aholibamah bore Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These were the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
And Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the souls of his house, his cattle and all his animals, and all his possessions which he had gained in the land of Canaan, and went to a land away from the presence of his brother Jacob.
For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together, and the land where they were sojourners could not support them because of their livestock.
So Esau dwelt in Mount Seir. Esau is Edom.
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
These were the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, and Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These were the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.
These were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
These were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon. And she bore to Esau: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
These were the chiefs of the sons of Esau: The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau, were Chief Teman, Chief Omar, Chief Zepho, Chief Kenaz,
Chief Korah, Chief Gatam, and Chief Amalek. These were the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Adah.
These were the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chief Nahath, Chief Zerah, Chief Shammah, and Chief Mizzah. These were the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom. These were the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife.
And these were the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chief Jeush, Chief Jaalam, and Chief Korah. These were the chiefs from Aholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah.
These were the sons of Esau, who is Edom; and these were their chiefs.
These were the sons of Seir the Horite who dwelt in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.
And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan’s sister was Timna.
These were the sons of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
These were the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah. This was the Anah who found the water in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
These were the children of Anah: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
These were the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
These were the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
These were the sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
These were the chiefs of the Horites: Chief Lotan, Chief Shobal, Chief Zibeon, Chief Anah,
Chief Dishon, Chief Ezer, and Chief Dishan. These were the chiefs of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
Now these were the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the children of Israel:
Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his place.
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Avith.
And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.
And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his place.
And Saul died, and Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his place.
And Baal-Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Pau; his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
And these were the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their families and their places, by their names: Chief Timnah, Chief Alvah, Chief Jetheth,
Chief Aholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,
Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar,
Chief Magdiel, and Chief Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession. Esau was the father of the Edomites.
Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father was a sojourner, in the land of Canaan.
These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought an evil report of them to his father.
Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age. And he made him a tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.
But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.
And Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more.
And he said to them, Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:
For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.
And his brothers said to him, Shall you indeed become king over us? Or shall you indeed rule over us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
Then he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed another dream: and behold, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.
And he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall it come to pass that your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to prostrate ourselves to the earth before you?
And his brothers were jealous of him; but his father treasured up these words.
And his brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.
And he said to him, Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
And a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, What are you seeking?
And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are feeding their flocks.
And the man said, They have departed from here, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.
Now when they saw him from a distance, even before he came near them, they conspired against him to kill him.
And they said to one another, Behold, this master of dreams is coming!
Come now therefore, let us kill him and cast him into a pit; and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him. And we shall see what will become of his dreams!
But Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, Let us not smite his soul.
And Reuben said to them, Do not shed blood, but cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him; that he might rescue him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father.
So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic reaching to the soles of his feet.
And they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
And they sat down to eat food. And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices, balm, and myrrh, going and bringing them down to Egypt.
And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?
Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brothers agreed.
Then some Midianite traders passed by; and the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he tore his clothes.
And he returned to his brothers and said, The lad is no more; and I, where shall I go?
And they took Joseph’s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood.
And they sent the tunic reaching to the soles of the feet, and they brought it to their father and said, We have found this. Do you recognize whether it is your son’s tunic or not?
And he recognized it and said, It is my son’s tunic. An evil beast has devoured him. Joseph has been rent and torn to pieces.
And Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
And all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, I will go down into Sheol mourning for my son. Thus his father wept for him.
Now the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.
It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he took her and went in to her.
And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
And she did so again and bore a son, and called his name Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.
Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah killed him.
And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up seed to your brother.
But Onan knew that the heir would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he spoiled it on the ground, so as not to give seed to his brother.
And the thing which he did made the eye of Jehovah quiver; therefore He killed him also.
Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father’s house till my son Shelah is grown. For he thought, Lest he also die like his brothers. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
And she took off her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place which was on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife.
When Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, because she had veiled her face.
And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Please let me come in to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. So she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?
And he said, I will send a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a pledge till you send it?
And he said, What pledge shall I give you? So she said, Your signet ring and cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.
So she arose and went away, and laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.
And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand, but he did not find her.
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot who was openly by the wayside? And they said, There was no harlot here.
So he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot there.
And Judah said, Let her take them for herself, that we not be held in contempt; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.
And it came to pass, after about three months, that Judah was told, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; furthermore she is with child by prostitution. So Judah said, Bring her out and let her be burned!
When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these belong, I am with child. And she said, Please acknowledge whose these are; the signet ring and cord, and staff.
And Judah acknowledged them and said, She has been more righteous than I, because I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he never knew her again.
And it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.
And so it was, when she was giving birth, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his hand, saying, This one came out first.
And it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came forth; and she said, How have you broken through this breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.
And afterward out came his brother who had the scarlet thread on his hand. And his name was called Zerah.
Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian man, bought him from the hands of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah made all he did to prosper in his hand.
And Joseph found favor in his eyes, and served him. And he appointed him over his house, and all that he had he entrusted to his hand.
And it came to pass, from the time that he had appointed him over his house and all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had in the house and in the field.
Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome and good looking.
And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me.
But he refused and said to his master’s wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has entrusted all that he has into my hand.
There is no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?
And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he did not give heed to her, to lie with her or to be with her.
And it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were inside,
that she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.
And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,
that she summoned the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, Behold, he has brought in to us a Hebrew man to make sport of us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice.
And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.
So she kept his garment with her until his master came into the house.
And she spoke to him with words like these, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to make sport of me;
and it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, Your servant did to me after this manner, that his anger burned.
And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison house, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison house.
But Jehovah was with Joseph and extended mercy to him, and He gave him favor in the eyes of the warden of the prison house.
And the warden of the prison house entrusted into Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison house; whatever they did there, it was his doing.
The warden of the prison house did not oversee anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah made it prosper.
And it came to pass after these things that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt committed offense against their lord, the king of Egypt.
And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
And he put them into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison house, the place where Joseph was confined.
And the captain of the guard assigned Joseph to them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a time.
And the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, had a dream, both of them, each man’s dream in one night and each man’s dream with its own interpretation.
And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and behold they appeared to be troubled.
So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were with him in the custody of his lord’s house, saying, Why are your faces sad today?
And they said to him, We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter. So Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.
And the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, Behold, in my dream a vine was before me,
and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes.
And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.
Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you shall put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand according to the former custom, when you were his cupbearer.
But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house.
For truly I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should have put me into the dungeon.
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also in my dream saw three baskets of white bread on my head.
And in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
Yet within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.
And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and of the chief baker among his servants.
And he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing again, and he put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
But he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
Then it came to pass, at the end of two years of days, that Pharaoh was dreaming: And behold, he was standing by the river.
And behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat of flesh; and they fed in the marshes.
And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, bad looking and thin of flesh, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the river.
And the bad looking and thin-fleshed cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
And he went to sleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good.
And behold, seven thin heads, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and lo, it was a dream.
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and summoned all the astrologers of Egypt and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.
Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I remember my offenses this day.
When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker,
we each dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.
And there was a Hebrew lad with us there, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his dream.
And it came to pass, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.
Then Pharaoh sent and summoned Joseph, and they rushed him out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream, to interpret it.
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is someone besides me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph: Behold, in my dream I stood on the bank of the river.
And behold, seven cows came up out of the river, fat of flesh and fine looking; and they fed in the marshes.
And behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very bad looking and thin of flesh, such badness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt.
And the thin and bad cows ate up the first seven fat cows.
And when they had entered their stomachs, it would not have been known that they had entered their stomachs, for they looked just as bad as at the beginning. So I awoke.
Also I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.
And behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them.
And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. And I told this to the astrologers, but no one could explain it to me.
And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dreams of Pharaoh are one; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do:
The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years; the dreams are one.
And the seven thin and bad cows which came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads scorched by the east wind are seven years of famine.
This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt;
and after them seven years of famine will arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine will deplete the land.
And the plenty will not be perceived in the land because of the famine following after, for it will be very severe.
And the dream was repeated unto Pharaoh twice because the thing is determined by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
Now therefore, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint deputies over the land, to collect one-fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty.
And let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain for food in the cities under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them guard it.
And that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land may not perish during the famine.
And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Inasmuch as God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.
You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand; and he clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
And he made him ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried out before him, Bow the knee! So he set him over all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh also said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls.
And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them.
And Joseph gathered very much grain, as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for it was without number.
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.
And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.
And the name of the second he called Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
And the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended,
and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. And the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
And when all the land of Egypt was hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, do.
And the famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.
And all earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy, because the famine was severe in all the earth.
Now when Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why are you looking at each other?
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down to that place and buy for us from there, that we may live and not die.
And Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.
But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, Lest he encounter some harm.
And the sons of Israel went to buy grain among those who journeyed, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
And Joseph was lord over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed down before him, their faces to the earth.
And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them and spoke harshly to them, and he said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!
And they said to him, No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food.
We are all sons of one man; we are honest; your servants are not spies.
And he said to them, No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.
And they said, Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and lo, the youngest is with our father today, and one is not.
And Joseph said to them, It is as I have spoken to you, saying, You are spies!
In this manner you shall be tested: By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proven to see whether there is any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you are spies!
So he put them all together in prison three days.
And Joseph said to them the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God:
If you are honest, let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses.
And bring your youngest brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die. And they did so.
And they said to one another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not listen; therefore this distress has come upon us.
And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now required of us.
But they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke to them through an interpreter.
And he turned himself away from them and wept, and returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
And Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain, to restore every man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. Thus he did for them.
And they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there.
And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the lodging, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
And he said to his brothers, My money has been restored, and lo, it is in my sack! And their hearts failed them and they were afraid, saying to one another, What is this that God has done to us?
And they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had befallen them, saying:
The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies in the land.
And we said to him, We are honest; we are not spies.
We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with our father this day in the land of Canaan.
And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I will know that you are honest: Leave one of your brothers here with me, take food for the famine of your houses, and go.
And bring your youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are honest. I will give your brother to you, and you may trade in the land.
And it happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me: Joseph is not, Simeon is not, and you would take Benjamin. All these things are against me.
And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.
But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If any harm should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would bring down my gray hair in sorrow to Sheol.
Now the famine was severe in the land.
And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, Go back, buy us a little food.
And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly charged us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
But if you will not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
And Israel said, Why did you deal so wickedly with me as to tell the man whether you had yet another brother?
And they said, The man sought to ask us about ourselves and our kindred, saying, Is your father still alive? Have you another brother? And we told him these words with our mouths. Could we possibly have known that he would say, Bring your brother down?
And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you and also our little ones.
I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the guilt forever.
For if we had not delayed, surely by now we would have returned this second time.
And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and carry down a present for the man; a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts and almonds.
Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight.
Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man.
And may God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!
So the men took this present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Take these men to my house, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
And the man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, It is because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may roll against us and fall upon us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.
And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house and spoke with him at the entrance of the house,
and said, O sir, we indeed came down the first time to buy food;
but it happened, when we came to the lodging place, that we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand.
And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.
And he said, Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
So the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.
And they made the present ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.
And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and prostrated before him to the earth.
And he asked after their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?
And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves.
And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.
Now his compassions yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought somewhere to weep. And he went into his chamber and wept there.
And he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, Serve the food.
And they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men were astonished at one another.
And he took portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five hands greater than any of theirs. So they drank and were drunken with him.
And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack.
And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money. So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
As soon as the morning had dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.
And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise and pursue the men; and when you have overtaken them, say to them, Why have you repaid evil for good?
Is not this the one from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.
So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
And they said to him, Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing.
Behold, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house?
With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.
And he said, Now also let it be according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be innocent.
And each man hastened to let down his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
And he searched. He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
Then they tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.
And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there; and they prostrated before him on the ground.
And Joseph said to them, What deed is this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?
And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup was found.
And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.
Then Judah came near to him and said: O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord, and do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.
My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father or a brother?
And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, who is young; his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
But you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.
And it came to pass, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord.
And our father said, Go back and buy us a little food.
And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.
And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons;
and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn to pieces; and I have not seen him since.
And if you take this one also from before me, and harm befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to Sheol.
Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad is not with us, since his soul is bound up in the lad’s soul,
it shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the guilt before my father for all time.
Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers.
For how shall I go up to my father if the lad is not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?
Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, Make everyone go out from me! So no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
And he wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.
And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed at his presence.
And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come near to me. So they came near. And he said: I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry in your eyes because you sold me here; for God has sent me before you to preserve life.
For these two years the famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
And God sent me before you to preserve you as a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay.
And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children’s children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have.
And I will nourish you there, so that you and your house, and all that you have, not come to poverty; for there are yet five years of famine.
And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is my mouth that is speaking to you.
And you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and bring my father down here.
And he fell on the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
Moreover he kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him.
And the report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brothers have come. And it was well pleasing in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants.
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan.
And bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.
Now you are commanded; do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come.
Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey.
He gave to all of them, to each man, changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.
And he sent to his father these things: ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father for the journey.
So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, See that you do not become perturbed along the way.
And they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.
And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruling over all the land of Egypt. And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.
But when they told him all the words which Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.
And Israel said, It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.
So Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba. And he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and called out, Jacob! Jacob! And he said, Here am I.
And He said, I am the Mighty God, the God of your fathers. Do not fear to go down to Egypt, for I will make of you a great nation there.
I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will arise to bring you back. And Joseph shall put his hand on your eyes.
And Jacob arose from Beer-sheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
So they took their livestock and their possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.
His sons and his sons’ sons, his daughters and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
And these were the names of the sons of Israel who went into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben was Jacob’s firstborn.
The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron.
The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
These were the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls, his sons and his daughters: thirty-three.
The sons of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
The sons of Asher were Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. And the sons of Beriah were Heber and Malchiel.
These were the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bore to Jacob: sixteen souls.
The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife, were Joseph and Benjamin.
And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him.
The sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
These were the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: fourteen souls in all.
The son of Dan was Hushim.
The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: seven souls in all.
All the souls who went with Jacob to Egypt, who came forth from his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, were sixty-six souls in all.
And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob who went into Egypt were seventy.
And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to give directions before him to Goshen. And they came into the land of Goshen.
And Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; and he presented himself to him, and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.
And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.
And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s house, I will go up and report to Pharaoh, and say to him, My brothers and those of my fathers house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
And the men tend cattle, for they are men of livestock; and they have brought their flocks, their herds, and all that they have.
So it shall be, when Pharaoh summons you and says, What is your occupation?
that you shall say, Your servants have been men of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers; that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
And Joseph came and reported to Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brothers, their flocks and their herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers.
And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.
The land of Egypt is before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any men with ability among them, make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.
And Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?
And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
And Joseph sustained his father, his brothers, and all his father’s house with food, according to the mouths of the children.
And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.
And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
And when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.
And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and I will give you bread for your livestock, if the money has failed.
So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year.
When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our cattle and livestock. Nothing remains before my lord but our bodies and our lands.
Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land not be desolate.
And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s.
And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt to the other end.
Only the land of the priests he did not buy; for the priests had portions prescribed to them by Pharaoh, and they ate their portions which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.
Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.
And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh; and four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your houses and as food for your little ones.
And they said, You have saved our lives; let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have one-fifth, except for the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh’s.
And Israel remained in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they settled on property they owned there and grew and multiplied exceedingly.
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years.
And the time drew near for Israel to die. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, Now if I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt,
but let me lie with my fathers. You shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.
And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel prostrated himself on the head of the bed.
Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, Behold, your father is sick; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
And Jacob was told, they said, Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you. And Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed.
And Jacob said to Joseph: God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,
and said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and give this land to your seed after you as an enduring possession.
And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they shall be called according to the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
But as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (which is Bethlehem).
And Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?
And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.
Now the eyes of Israel had become dull with age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face; but lo, God has also shown me your seed.
And Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he prostrated with his face to the earth.
And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them to him.
And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
And he blessed Joseph, and said: God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me since I was born to this day,
the Angel who redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it caused his eye to quiver; so he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head onto Manasseh’s head.
And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.
But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
And he blessed them that day, saying, In you Israel shall bless, saying, May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh! And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
Then Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers.
Moreover I have extended your shoulder above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.
And Jacob summoned his sons and said, Gather around, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days:
Gather around and hear, you sons of Jacob, and listen to Israel your father.
Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power.
Like bubbling water, you shall not excel, because you went up to your father’s bed; then you defiled it; he went up to my couch.
Simeon and Levi are brothers; implements of violence are their weapons.
Let not my soul enter their council; let not my honor be united to their assembly; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they have hamstrung an ox.
Cursed is their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father’s children shall bow down before you.
Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He bows down, he crouches like a lion; and as a lioness, who shall rouse him?
The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the cleansing of the peoples.
Binding His donkey to the vine, and His donkey’s colt to the choice vine, He has washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes;
His eyes flashing with wine, and His teeth white with milk.
Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; he shall become a haven for ships, bordering Sidon.
Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between two burdens.
He saw that the resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant. He bowed his shoulder to bear a burden, and became a servant to forced labor.
Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider shall fall backward.
I have waited for your salvation, O Jehovah.
Gad, a troop shall attack him, but he shall attack their heel.
Bread from Asher shall be rich, and he shall produce kings’ delicacies.
Naphtali is a deer let loose; he utters beautiful words.
Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches have run over the wall.
The archers have bitterly grieved him, shot at him and carried animosity against him.
But his bow remained steadfast, and the arms of his hands were made nimble by the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob; from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel,
by the Mighty God of your father who will help you, and by the Almighty who will bless you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my ancestors, to the bounds of the enduring hills. They shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.
Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall distribute the spoils.
All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them. And he blessed them; he blessed each one according to his own blessing.
And he charged them and said to them: I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a burial place.
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah.
The field and the cave that is there were purchased from the sons of Heth.
And when Jacob had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed and expired, and was gathered to his people.
And Joseph fell on his father’s face, and wept over him, and kissed him.
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.
Forty days were fulfilled for him, for such are the days fulfilled for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
And when the days of his weeping were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I am dying; in my grave which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me. Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and return.
And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.
And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great company.
And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is on the other side of Jordan, and they mourned there with great and heavy lamentation. He observed seven days of mourning for his father.
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a great mourning of the Egyptians. Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is on the other side of Jordan.
So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them.
For his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place.
And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.
And when Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, Perhaps Joseph will hold a grudge against us, and return and repay us for all the evil which we did unto him.
So they sent a messenger to Joseph, saying, Before your father died he commanded, saying,
Thus you shall say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin; for they did evil to you. Now, please, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
And his brothers also went and prostrated before his face, and they said, Behold, we are your slaves.
And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?
As for you, you had devised evil against me; but God had planned it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive.
Now therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s house. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. Also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph’s knees.
And Joseph said to his brethren, I am dying; but God will attend to visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.
So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt; each man and his house came with Jacob:
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
All those who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls (for Joseph was in Egypt already).
And Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation.
And the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly numerous; and the land was filled with them.
And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and vast than we.
Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and thus go up out of the land.
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh supply cities, Pithom and Raamses.
But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel.
So the Egyptians made the children of Israel work with harshness.
And they made their lives bitter with hard labor; in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of labor in the field. All their labor in which they made them work was with harshness.
And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah,
and he said: When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see them on the birthstools, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.
But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.
And the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?
And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives come to them.
Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly numerous.
And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He provided houses for them.
And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son who is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.
And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi.
And the woman conceived and bore a son. And when she saw that he was good, she hid him three months.
And when she could no longer hide him, she took a vessel of reeds for him, daubed it with asphalt and pitch, put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river bank.
And his sister stood at a distance, to know what would be done to him.
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens were walking along the riverside; and when she saw the vessel among the reeds, she sent her maid to fetch it.
And when she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call a wet nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?
And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. So the maiden went and called the child’s mother.
And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed him.
And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, saying, Because I drew him out of the water.
And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked upon their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
And he looked this way and that, and when he saw no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
And when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men were fighting, and he said to the guilty one, Why are you striking the other fellow?
And he said, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared and said, Surely this thing is known!
And when Pharaoh heard of the matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and they filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.
And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and delivered them, and watered their flock.
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you have made haste today?
And they said, An Egyptian man delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and proceeded to draw for us and watered the flock.
And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Invite him, that he may eat bread.
And Moses agreed to live with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.
And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have become a sojourner in a foreign land.
And it came to pass after many days that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
And God gave attention to the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them.
Now Moses was with the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed.
And Moses thought, I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burned up.
And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, Moses! Moses! And he said, Here am I.
And He said, Do not approach here. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
Moreover He said, I am the God of your fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.
And Jehovah said: I have given attention to see the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I have acknowledged their pain.
And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and broad land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.
And Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?
And He said, I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.
And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the sons of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?
And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.
Moreover God said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel: Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My eternal name, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.
Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen what is being done to you in Egypt;
and I intend to bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
And they will heed your voice; and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has met with us; and now, please, let us go three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.
And I have taken into consideration that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not except by a mighty hand.
So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and after that he will let you go.
And I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians; and it shall come to pass, when you go, that you shall not leave empty.
But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, of her who sojourns in her house, articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters. Thus you shall plunder the Egyptians.
And Moses answered and said, But suppose they will not believe, nor listen to my voice; suppose they say, Jehovah has not appeared to you.
And Jehovah said to him, What is that in your hand? He said, A staff.
And He said, Throw it on the ground. So he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled before it.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand and take it by the tail; and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand;
that they may believe that Jehovah the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.
Furthermore Jehovah said to him, Now put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, like snow.
And He said, Put your hand back into your bosom. So he put his hand back into his bosom, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his other flesh.
And it shall come to pass when they do not believe, nor heed the voice of the first sign, that perhaps they will believe the voice of the subsequent sign.
And it shall come to pass when they do not believe even these two signs, nor listen to your voice, that you shall take water from the river and pour it on the dry land. And the water which you take from the river shall become blood on the dry land.
And Moses said to Jehovah, O my Lord, I am not a man of words, neither formerly in times past nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I have a heavy mouth and a dull tongue.
And Jehovah said to him, Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
Now therefore, go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.
And he said, O my Lord, please send by the hand of whomever You may send.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Moses, and He said: Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he can form words to speak. And behold, he is also coming out to meet you; and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do.
And he shall speak for you to the people. And he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be to him as God.
And you shall take this staff in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.
So Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Please let me go and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.
And Moses took his wife and his sons and mounted them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
And Jehovah said to Moses, When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. And I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go.
And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah: Israel is My son, My firstborn.
And I say unto you, Let My son go that he may serve Me. And if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.
And it came to pass on the way, at the lodging place, that Jehovah met him and sought to kill him.
And Zipporah took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely you are a husband of blood to me!
So He let him go. Then she said, You are a husband of blood; because of the circumcision.
And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. So he went and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.
And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him, and all the signs which He had commanded him.
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.
And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses. And he did the signs in the eyes of the people.
And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel and that He had given attention to their affliction, they bowed down and prostrated themselves.
Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.
And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah; neither will I let Israel go.
And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now, let us go three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, that He not fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.
And the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, why do you restrain the people from their work? Go to your burdens.
And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are many now, and you have made them cease from their burdens.
So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,
You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.
And you shall lay on them the tally of bricks which they made before. You shall not diminish it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
Let more labor be laid upon the men, that they may work in it, and let them not regard deceptive words.
And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw.
Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your labor shall be diminished.
So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.
And the taskmasters were pressing upon them saying, Fulfill your work, the matter of each day, as when there was straw.
And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, Why have you not completed the prescribed amount to make brick, both yesterday and today, as before?
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, Why are you dealing thus with your servants?
There is no straw given to your slaves, and they say to us, Make brick! And behold, your servants are beaten, but the fault is in your own people.
But he said, You are idle! Idle! Therefore you say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
Therefore go now and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the amount of bricks.
And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in a bad way after it was said, You shall not diminish any bricks from the matter day by day.
And, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron standing there to meet them.
And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge, because you have made us abhorrent in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.
And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Lord, why have You brought hurt upon this people? Why then have You sent me?
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You rescued to deliver Your people.
Then Jehovah said to Moses, Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.
And God spoke to Moses and said to him: I am Jehovah.
I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Jehovah I have not been known to them.
I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were sojourners.
And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant.
Therefore say to the sons of Israel: I am Jehovah; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
I will take you to Myself as a people, and I will be God to you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
And I will bring you into the land which I raised My hand and swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you for a possession. I am Jehovah.
And Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel; but they did not listen to Moses, because of anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Go, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, The sons of Israel have not listened to me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These were the families of Reuben.
And the sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the families of Simeon.
These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven.
The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimi according to their families.
And the sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three.
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the families of Levi according to their generations.
Now Amram took for himself Jochebed, his father’s sister, as wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven.
The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri.
Aaron took to himself Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, as wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
And the sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the families of the Korahites.
Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites according to their families.
These were the same Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.
These were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt. These were the same Moses and Aaron.
And it came to pass, on the day Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
that Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto you.
But Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?
And Jehovah said to Moses: See, I have made you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.
You shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land.
And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
But Pharaoh will not heed you, so that I may lay My hand upon Egypt and bring My hosts, My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt with great judgments.
And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
And Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah commanded them; thus they did.
And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, Show a sign for yourselves, then you shall say to Aaron, Take your staff and cast it before Pharaoh, and let it become a serpent.
And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as Jehovah commanded. And Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
And Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. So the magicians of Egypt, they also did so with their enchantments.
For every man threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had said.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Pharaoh’s heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go.
Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the water, and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him; and the staff which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand.
And you shall say to him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, Let My people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; but behold, until now you have not given heed.
Therefore thus says Jehovah: By this you shall know that I am Jehovah. Behold, I will strike the waters in the river with the staff that is in my hand, and they shall be turned to blood.
And the fish that are in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians shall weary themselves to drink the water of the river.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their bodies of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, in vessels of both wood and stone.
And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded. And he lifted up the staff and struck the waters that were in the river, in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. And all the waters in the river were turned to blood.
And the fish in the river died, the river stunk, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had said.
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither did he lay any of this to heart.
And all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river.
And seven days passed after Jehovah had struck the river.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh and say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your territory with frogs.
And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into your house, into your bedroom, onto your bed, into the houses of your servants, onto your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls.
And the frogs shall come up upon you, upon your people, and upon all your servants.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.
And Moses said to Pharaoh, Be glorified: For when shall I make supplication for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?
And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Let it be according to your word, that you may come to understand that there is no one like Jehovah our God.
And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to Jehovah concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh.
And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields.
And they piled them up in heaps, and the land stunk.
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, his heart was hardened and he did not heed them; as Jehovah had said.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your staff, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and it became lice upon man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man and beast.
Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them; as Jehovah had said.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon you and your servants, upon your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where they are.
And for that day I have set apart the land of Goshen, in which My people remain, that no swarms of flies shall be there, in order that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
I have appointed a ransom for My people from your people. This sign shall be tomorrow.
And Jehovah did so. Thick swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh, into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was spoiled because of the swarms of flies.
And Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron, and said, Go! Sacrifice to your God in the land.
And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians unto Jehovah our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us?
We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God as He will command us.
And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice unto Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Make supplication for me.
And Moses said, Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat Jehovah, that the swarms of flies may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not continue dealing deceitfully in not letting the people go to sacrifice unto Jehovah.
And Moses went out from Pharaoh and entreated Jehovah.
And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained.
And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also; neither would he let the people go.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
And if you refuse to let them go, and still hold them,
behold, the hand of Jehovah will be upon your cattle in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep; a very heavy pestilence.
And Jehovah will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.
And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow Jehovah will do this thing in the land.
And Jehovah did this thing on the next day, and all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.
And Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses toss it toward the heavens before Pharaoh’s eyes.
And it shall become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it shall be an inflammation breaking out into boils upon man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.
And they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses tossed them toward the heavens. And they became inflammations breaking out into boils upon man and beast.
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the inflammations, for the inflammations were upon the magicians and upon all the Egyptians.
And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he did not heed them, as Jehovah had spoken to Moses.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, that they may serve Me,
for at this time I will send all My plagues upon your heart, and upon your servants and upon your people, that you may come to understand that there is no one like Me in all the earth.
For if I had stretched forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth.
And indeed for this purpose I have ordained you, to show My power in you, and to declare My name in all the earth.
As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go.
Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now.
Therefore send now and gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down upon every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought into shelter; and they shall die.
The ones who feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee to the shelters.
But the ones who did not set their heart upon the word of Jehovah left their servants and their livestock in the field.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward the heavens, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt; upon man, upon beast, and upon every plant of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
And Moses stretched forth his staff toward the heavens; and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire went to the ground. And Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
So there was hail, and fire in the midst of the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
And the hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every plant of the field and shattered every tree of the field.
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
And Pharaoh sent and summoned Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
Entreat Jehovah, that there be no more Divine thundering and hail, for it is enough. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.
And Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Jehovah. The thunder shall cease, and there shall be no more hail; that you may know that the earth is Jehovah’s.
But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear before Jehovah God.
Now the flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the head and the flax was in bud.
But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they are late crops.
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to Jehovah. And the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again, and hardened his heart; he and his servants.
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his servants, in order to perform these signs of Mine among them,
and that you may recount in the ears of your son and your son’s son how I have dealt ruthlessly in Egypt, and My signs which I have brought to pass among them, that you have come to know that I am Jehovah.
And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh and said to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, that they may serve Me.
Or else, if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your territory.
And they shall cover the face of the earth, so that no one will be able to see the land; and they shall eat the rest of what is left, which remains to you from the hail, and they shall eat every tree which grows up for you out of the field.
And they shall fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.
And Pharaoh’s servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt has vanished?
And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are the ones going?
And Moses said, We will go with our young and our old; with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds we will go, for it is a feast unto Jehovah.
And he said to them, Jehovah be with you if ever I let you and your little ones go! Consider, for evil is before you!
Not so! Go now, you who are men, and serve Jehovah, for that is what you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every plant of the land; all that the hail has left.
And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and rested on all the territory of Egypt. Exceedingly numerous; previously there had been no such locusts as they, nor shall there be such after them.
For they covered the eye of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. So there remained nothing green on the trees or on the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.
And Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron in haste, and said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.
Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that He may take away from me this death only.
And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated Jehovah.
And Jehovah turned a very strong wind from the west, which took the locusts away and blew them into the Red Sea. There remained not one locust in all the territory of Egypt.
And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, darkness which may even be felt.
And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
They did not see one another; nor did anyone rise from his place for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
And Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be kept back. Let your little ones also go with you.
And Moses said, You must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may make offerings unto Jehovah our God.
Our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind. For we must take some of them to serve Jehovah our God, and even we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah until we arrive there.
And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me! Take heed to yourself and do not see my face again! For in the day you see my face you shall die!
And Moses said, You have spoken correctly. I will not see your face again.
And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will bring yet one more plague upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will be driving to drive you out from here.
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor, articles of silver and articles of gold.
And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.
And Moses said, Thus says Jehovah: About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt;
and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill, and every firstborn of the animals.
And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as was not like it before, nor shall be like it again.
But against the children of Israel shall not a single dog move its tongue, against man or beast, that you may know that Jehovah makes a separation between Egypt and Israel.
And all these your servants shall come down to me and prostrate themselves to me, saying, Get out, you and all the people at your feet! After that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in burning anger.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh will not heed you, so that My signs may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
And Moses and Aaron did all these signs before Pharaoh; and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
This month shall be to you the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day of this month every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a house.
And if the house is too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of souls; according to each man’s eating you shall reckon it for the lamb.
Your lamb shall be whole, a male of the first year. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats.
And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it within the evening.
And they shall take some of the blood and put it upon the two doorposts and upon the lintel of the houses where they eat it.
And they shall eat the flesh in that night; roasted with fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
Do not eat it raw, nor cooked with boiling in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs and its entrails.
And you shall let none of it remain until morning; and whatever remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire.
And thus you shall eat it: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste. It is Passover unto Jehovah.
For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. I am Jehovah.
And the blood shall be a sign unto you on the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you; and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
And this day shall be to you a memorial; and you shall keep it as a feast unto Jehovah throughout your generations. You shall keep it as a feast by a perpetual ordinance.
Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
On the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No manner of work shall be done on them; except for each soul for eating; that only may be done by you.
And you shall observe Unleavened Bread, for on this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a perpetual ordinance.
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month, at evening.
For seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses, for whoever eats what is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or a native of the land.
You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.
Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, Draw out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover.
And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin. And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until morning.
For Jehovah will pass through to strike Egypt; and when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will pass over the door and not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you.
And you shall observe this matter as an ordinance for you and your sons perpetually.
And it shall come to pass when you come to the land which Jehovah shall give you, just as He promised, that you shall keep this service.
And it shall be, when your children say to you, What do you mean by this service?
that you shall say, It is the Passover sacrifice of Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He struck Egypt and delivered our houses. So the people bowed down and prostrated themselves.
And the sons of Israel departed and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did.
And it came to pass at midnight that Jehovah struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the prison house, and every firstborn of livestock.
And Pharaoh arose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great outcry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one who died.
And he summoned Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, go out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel. And go, serve Jehovah as you have said.
Also take your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
And the Egyptians prevailed upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste. For they thought, We shall all die!
And the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.
And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they asked from the Egyptians articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing.
And Jehovah had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they granted their requests. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.
And a mixed multitude also went up with them, and flocks and herds; exceedingly many cattle.
And they baked unleavened cakes from the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared food for themselves.
Now the time the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt remained there was four hundred and thirty years.
And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, on the same day it came to pass, that all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.
It is a night of observance unto Jehovah for bringing them out of the land of Egypt. This is that night of Jehovah, an observance for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover: No son of a foreigner shall eat of it.
But every man’s servant who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it.
A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones.
All the congregation of Israel shall observe it.
And when a sojourner stays with you and wishes to keep the Passover unto Jehovah, let every male of his be circumcised, and then let him draw near to observe it; and he shall be as a native of the land. For no uncircumcised person shall eat it.
One law shall be for the native, and for the sojourner who stays among you.
Thus all the children of Israel did; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
And it came to pass on the same day, that Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their armies.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Consecrate unto Me every firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast; it is Mine.
And Moses said to the people: Remember this day in which you went out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah has brought you out from here. Nothing leavened shall be eaten.
On this day you are going out, in the month Abib.
And it shall be, when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall do this service in this month.
Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast unto Jehovah.
Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days. And nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall leaven be seen among you in all your territories.
And you shall make known to your son in that day, saying, This is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came up out of Egypt.
It shall be for a sign to you on your hand and as a memorial between your eyes, that the Law of Jehovah may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Jehovah has brought you out of Egypt.
You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season year after year.
And it shall be, when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you,
that you shall devote unto Jehovah all that open the womb: every firstborn offspring from an animal which you have; the males belong to Jehovah.
But every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. And every firstborn of man among your children you shall redeem.
And it shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? that you shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh was stubborn about letting us go, that Jehovah killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice unto Jehovah every male that opens the womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.
And it shall be for a sign on your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah has brought us forth out of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God thought, Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt.
So God led the people around by way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up in battle array out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had sworn the sons of Israel to oath saying, God will attend to visit you, and you shall bring up my bones from here with you.
So they took their journey from Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the wilderness.
And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to shine on them, to go by day and night.
The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to the children of Israel, that they return and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea.
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are perplexed by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.
And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will glorify Myself over Pharaoh and over all his army, that the Egyptians may know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.
And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him.
And he took six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with officers over every one of them.
And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
And the Egyptians pursued them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were pulling up after them. And they were greatly afraid, and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.
And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt so with us, to bring us up out of Egypt?
Was this not the word we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.
And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid. Take your stand, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall not see again forever.
Jehovah will fight for you, and you shall keep silent.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry out to Me? Speak to the children of Israel that they set out.
And lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
And behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. And I will glorify Myself over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen.
And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have glorified Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.
And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them.
And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness to the one, and it gave light by night to the other, so that the one did not come near the other all that night.
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea into dry land, and the waters were divided.
So the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He confused the camp of the Egyptians.
And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.
Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when it turned to daybreak, the sea returned to normal, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. And Jehovah shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
And the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained.
But the children of Israel had walked upon dry ground in the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.
And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah had dealt against Egypt. And the people feared Jehovah, and believed Jehovah and His servant Moses.
Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto Jehovah, and spoke, saying: I will sing unto Jehovah, for He has triumphed gloriously! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!
Jehovah is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; He is my Mighty God, and I will adorn Him; my father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah is His name.
Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has cast into the sea; his chosen officers also are drowned in the Red Sea.
The abyss has covered them; they have sunk to the depths like a stone.
Your right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Jehovah, has dashed the enemy to pieces.
And in the greatness of Your majesty You have overthrown those who rose against You; You sent forth Your wrath; it consumed them like stubble.
And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up; the flowing waters stood upright like a heap; the depths hardened in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoils; my desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
Who is like You, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?
You stretched out Your right hand; the earth swallowed them.
You in Your mercy have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength unto Your holy habitation.
The people have heard and are afraid; anguish has taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.
Then the chiefs of Edom have been dismayed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling takes hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.
Fear and dread falls upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone, till Your people pass over, O Jehovah, till the people whom You have redeemed pass over.
You bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, in the place, O Jehovah, which You have made for Your own dwelling, the sanctuary, O Jehovah, which Your hands have established.
Jehovah reigns from everlasting and forever.
For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them. But the children of Israel have walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea.
And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
And Miriam answered them: Sing unto Jehovah, for He has risen up to be exalted! The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea!
And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea. And they went out into the Wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
And when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Marah.
And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
And he cried out unto Jehovah, and Jehovah showed him a tree. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute and an ordinance for them. And there He tested them,
and said: If you diligently heed the voice of Jehovah your God and do what is right in His eyes, give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have brought upon the Egyptians. For I am Jehovah who heals you.
And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there by the waters.
And they journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt.
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
And the children of Israel said to them, Oh, that we had died at the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of flesh and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from the heavens for you. And the people shall go out and gather in this matter day by day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My Law or not.
And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather day by day.
And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening you shall know that Jehovah has brought you out of the land of Egypt.
And in the morning you shall see the glory of Jehovah; for He hears your murmuring against Jehovah. But what are we, that you grumble against us?
And Moses said, You shall see when Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which you grumble against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against Jehovah.
And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your murmurings.
And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they turned and looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At evening you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
And it came to pass that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew all around the camp.
And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, were small flakes, as fine as frost on the ground.
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, Manna? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given you for food.
This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Let every man gather up food for each mouth, one omer per head; according to the number of souls let every man take for those in his tent.
And the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less.
And when they measured it with the omer, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They gathered according to the food for each mouth.
And Moses said, Let no one leave any of it till morning.
Nevertheless they did not heed Moses; but some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stunk. And Moses was furious with them.
So they gathered it every morning, every man the food for his mouth. And when the sun became hot, it melted.
And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the leaders of the congregation came and reported to Moses.
And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said: Tomorrow is a rest, a holy Sabbath unto Jehovah. Bake what you will bake today, and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.
So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it.
Then Moses said, Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath unto Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field.
Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there will be none.
And it happened that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My Laws?
Pay attention! For Jehovah has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
So the people rested on the seventh day.
And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And it was like white coriander seed, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
Then Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations.
As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came into the borders of the land of Canaan.
Now an omer is one-tenth of an ephah.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sin, at the mouth of Jehovah, and camped in Rephidim; and there was no water for the people to drink.
Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, Give us water, that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you tempt Jehovah?
And the people thirsted there for water, and the people grumbled against Moses, and said, Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?
And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me!
And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass over before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your staff with which you struck the river, and go.
Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel.
And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the quarreling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah in our midst or not?
And Amalek came and fought against Israel in Rephidim.
And Moses said to Joshua, Choose some men and go fight against Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.
So Joshua did as Moses said to him, to fight against Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
And so it was, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
But Moses’ hands became heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in the book and recount it in the ears of Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens.
And Moses built an altar and called its name, Jehovah-My-Banner;
saying, Because Jehovah has sworn with His hand on the throne: Jehovah is at war with Amalek from generation to generation.
And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard all that God had done for Moses and for His people Israel; that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.
And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife (after Moses had sent her away),
with her two sons, of whom the name of one was Gershom (for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land)
and the name of the other was Eliezer (for he said, The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh);
and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God.
And he said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.
And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. And they asked each other about their welfare, and they went into the tent.
And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on account of Israel, all the distress that they had encountered along the way, and how Jehovah had delivered them.
And Jethro rejoiced for all the good which Jehovah had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all the gods; for in the very things in which they behaved proudly, He was above them.
And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices unto God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
And so it was, on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening.
And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?
And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor; and I make known the statutes of God and His Laws.
And Moses’ father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do is not good.
Both you and these people who are with you will droop to exhaustion. For this thing is too much of a burden for you; you are not able to do it by yourself.
Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God be with you: Be before God for the people, so that you may bring the matters to God.
And you shall teach them the statutes and the Laws, and show them the way in which they should walk and the work they should do.
Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, who fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place these over them as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
And let them judge the people at all times. Then it will be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, and they shall bear the burden with you.
If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their place in peace.
So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
And they judged the people at all times; the hard matters they brought to Moses, but they judged every small matter themselves.
And Moses sent his father-in-law away, and he departed to his own land.
In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai.
For they had departed from Rephidim, had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. And Israel camped there before the mountain.
And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you unto Myself.
Now therefore, if you will listen to obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth is Mine.
And you shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.
And Moses came and summoned the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which Jehovah had commanded him.
And all the people answered together and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. So Moses brought back the words of the people unto Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes.
And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day Jehovah will come down upon Mount Sinai in the eyes of all the people.
And you shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, Take heed to yourselves that you do not go up to the mountain nor touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be executed to death.
Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall be stoned with stones or shot with an arrow; whether man or beast, he shall not live. When the ram’s horn sounds long, they shall go up to the mountain.
And Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.
And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not approach your wives.
And it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the shofar was very loud, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled.
And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.
And Mount Sinai was completely in smoke, because Jehovah had descended upon it in fire. Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.
And when the sound of the shofar continued its sound and became exceedingly loud, Moses spoke, and God answered him by voice.
And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down and warn the people, that they not break through to gaze at Jehovah, and many of them be attacked.
And let the priests who come near Jehovah sanctify themselves, that Jehovah not break forth against them.
And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You have warned us, saying, Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.
And Jehovah said to him, Away! Go down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to Jehovah, lest He break forth against them.
So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
And God spoke all these words, saying:
I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
You shall have no other gods before Me.
You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth;
you shall not bow down to them nor serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous Mighty God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
but showing goodness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not leave unpunished one who takes His name in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
and the seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah your God. In it you shall not do any work; you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your sojourner who is within your gates.
For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore Jehovah has blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.
Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which Jehovah your God is giving you.
You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not testify a witness of falsehood against your neighbor.
You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.
And all the people saw the thunders, the lightning flashes, the sound of the shofar, and the smoking mountain; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.
And they said unto Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but let not God speak with us, that we not die.
And Moses said to the people, Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that His fear may be before you, that you not sin.
And the people stood at a distance, and Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was.
And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens.
You shall not make for yourselves, along with Me, gods of silver or gods of gold.
An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you, and I will bless you.
And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stone; for if you wield your tool upon it, you defile it.
Nor shall you go up by steps to My altar, that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.
Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them:
If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free without payment.
If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go out with him.
If his master gives him a wife, and she has borne him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
But if the servant answers to say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,
then his master shall bring him to God. He shall also bring him to the door, or to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him always.
And if a man sells his daughter to be a female slave, she shall not go out as the male slaves go out.
If she is disagreeable to the eye of her master, who has betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed. He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, since he has dealt deceitfully with her.
And if he has betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her according to the manner of daughters.
If he takes another wife, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights.
And if he does not do these three for her, then she shall go out free, without money.
He who strikes a man so that he dies shall be executed to death.
However, if he did not lie in wait, but God allowed the meeting into his hand, then I will appoint for you a place where he may flee.
But if a man comes presumptuously against his neighbor, to kill him by deceit, you shall take him even from My altar, that he may die.
And he who strikes his father or his mother shall be executed to death.
He who steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, shall be executed to death.
And he who curses his father or his mother shall be executed to death.
If men strive with each other, and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to his bed,
if he rises again and walks about outside with his staff, then he who struck him shall be acquitted. He shall only pay for the loss of his time, and shall provide for him to be healed of his injuries.
And if a man beats his male or female servant with a rod, so that he dies under his hand, vengeance shall be taken to avenge.
Nevertheless, if he continues a day or two, vengeance shall not be taken; for he is part of his assets.
If men fight, and strike a pregnant woman, so that the child comes forth, without harm, he shall be punished to pay a fine as the woman’s husband imposes upon him; and he shall pay according to the assessment.
But if there is harm, then you shall requite soul for soul;
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
If a man strikes the eye of his male or female servant, and destroys it, he shall let him go free in exchange for his eye.
And if he knocks out the tooth of his male or female servant, he shall let him go free for his tooth.
If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, then the ox shall be stoned to death with stones, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be acquitted.
But if the ox tended to thrust with its horn in times past, and the owner has been given warning, and he has not kept it restrained, so that it has killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.
If a ransom is imposed upon him, then he shall pay to redeem his life, whatever is imposed upon him.
Whether it has gored a son or gored a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done unto him.
If the ox gores a male or female servant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
And if a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
the owner of the pit shall make compensation; he shall give money to the owner, and the dead animal shall be his.
If one man’s ox strikes against the ox of his neighbor, so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money; and the dead ox they shall also divide.
Or if it was known that the ox tended to thrust in time past, and its owner has not kept it restrained, he shall make compensation to pay, ox for ox, and the dead shall be his.
If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
If the thief is found breaking in, and he is struck so that he dies, there shall be no blood shed for him.
If the sun has risen upon him, there shall be guilt for his bloodshed. He shall make compensation to pay; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
If the thing stolen is found in his possession alive in his hand, whether it is an ox or donkey or sheep, he shall restore double.
If a man causes a field or vineyard to be consumed, and lets loose his animal, and it consumes another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.
If fire breaks out and lights upon thorns, so that stacked grain, standing grain, or the field has been consumed, he who kindled the fire shall make compensation to pay.
If a man delivers to his neighbor money or articles to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he shall restore double.
If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges to see whether he has put his hand into his neighbor’s goods.
For any kind of trespass, whether it be an ox, a donkey, a sheep, or clothing, or for any kind of lost item which another says is his, the matter of both of them shall come before the judges; and whomever the judges declare guilty shall restore double to his neighbor.
If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies, is hurt, or driven away, no one seeing it,
then an oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, that he has not put his hand into his neighbor’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept it, and he shall not make it good.
But if, in fact, it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it.
If it is rent and torn to pieces by a beast, then he shall bring it as evidence, and he shall not make good what was torn.
And if a man borrows anything from his neighbor, and it becomes injured or dies, the owner of it not being with it, he shall make compensation to pay.
If its owner was with it, he shall not make it good; if it was hired, it came for its hire.
If a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he shall give a dowry, the purchase price for her to be his wife.
If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
Whoever lies with an animal shall be executed to death.
He who sacrifices to any god, except to Jehovah only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
You shall neither mistreat a sojourner nor oppress him, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.
If you afflict them to humiliate them, and they make an outcry to cry out unto Me, I will hear and give heed to their cry;
and My anger will burn, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
If you lend money to My people who are poor among you, you shall not be like a moneylender to him; you shall not lay interest on him.
If you indeed take your neighbor’s garment as a pledge, you shall return it to him by the going down of the sun.
For that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin. What will he sleep in? And it will be that when he cries out to Me, I will give heed, for I am gracious.
You shall not curse God, nor curse a chief of your people.
You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe produce and your juices. The firstborn of your sons you shall give unto Me.
Likewise you shall do with your oxen and your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it unto Me.
And you shall be holy men unto Me: you shall not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.
You shall not raise a false report. Do not put your hand with the wicked to be an unjust witness.
You shall not follow the majority in doing evil; nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after the majority to thrust aside justice.
You shall not show partiality to a poor man in his dispute.
If you encounter your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall bring it back to restore it to him.
If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden, you shall refrain from leaving it to him; you shall help him set it free.
You shall not thrust aside the justice of your needy one in his dispute.
Keep yourself far away from a false matter; do not kill the innocent and righteous. For I will not justify the wicked.
And you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and perverts the words of the righteous.
Also you shall not oppress a sojourner, for you know the soul of a sojourner, because you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce,
but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the needy of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard and your olive grove.
Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female servant and the sojourner may be refreshed.
And in all that I have said to you, beware and make no mention of any other gods by name, nor let it be heard from your mouth.
Three times a year you shall keep a feast unto Me:
You shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I have commanded you, at the time appointed in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt; no one shall appear before Me empty);
and the Feast of Harvest, the firstfruits of your labors which you have sown in the field; and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in your produce from the field.
Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.
You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened; nor shall the fat of My feast remain until morning.
The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
Behold, I am sending an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.
Be on guard before Him and obey His voice; do not grieve Him, for He will not endure your transgressions; for My name is in Him.
But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and will afflict those who besiege you.
For My Angel will go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites and the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their works; but you shall tear them down to overthrow them, and break and shatter their pillars.
And you shall serve Jehovah your God, and He will bless your bread and your water. And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.
No one shall suffer miscarriage nor be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days.
I will send My dread before you, I will cause confusion among all the people to whom you come, and will give the neck of all your enemies to you.
And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you.
I will not drive them out before you in one year, that the land not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.
Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you are fruitful, and have taken possession of the land.
And I have set your borders from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River. For I will deliver up the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you shall drive them out before you.
You shall not make any covenants with them, nor with their gods.
They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against Me. For if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.
And He said to Moses, Come up to Jehovah, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and prostrate yourselves from a distance.
And Moses alone shall approach Jehovah, but they shall not approach; nor shall the people go up with him.
And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, All the words which Jehovah has spoken we will do.
And Moses wrote all the Words of Jehovah. And he arose early in the morning, and built an altar at the base of the mountain, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
And he sent young men of the sons of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and slaughtered oxen for sacrifices of peace unto Jehovah.
And Moses took half the blood and put it in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
And he took the Book of the Covenant and read in the ears of the people. And they said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do and obey.
And Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, This is the blood of the covenant which Jehovah has made with you according to all these words.
And Moses went up, along with Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,
and they saw the God of Israel. And there was under His feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and it was like the essence of the heavens in its clarity.
And He did not let loose His hand against the nobles of the children of Israel. And they saw God, and they ate and drank.
And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you tablets of stone, and the Law and commandments which I have written, to teach them.
And Moses arose with Joshua who ministered, and Moses went up to the mountain of God.
And he said to the elders, Wait here for us until we return to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur, who are rulers, are with you. Whoever has a matter, let him go to them.
And Moses went up into the mountain, and a cloud covered the mountain.
And the glory of Jehovah settled down upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day He summoned Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
The appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain before the eyes of the children of Israel.
And Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to the sons of Israel, that they take an offering for Me. From every man whose heart stirs him, you shall take My offering.
And this is the offering which you shall take from them: gold, silver, and bronze;
violet, purple, and scarlet material, fine linen, and goats’ hair;
ram skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;
oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the spiced incense;
onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate.
And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its articles, even so you shall do.
And they shall make an ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits shall be its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height.
And you shall overlay it with pure gold, inside and out you shall overlay it, and shall make on it a molding of gold all around.
You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them on its four feet; two rings shall be on one side, and two rings on the other side.
And you shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, that the ark may be carried with them.
The poles shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it.
And you shall put into the ark the Testimony which I am giving you.
You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits shall be its length and a cubit and a half its width.
And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work you shall make them at the two ends of the mercy seat.
Make one cherub at one end, and one cherub at the other end; you shall make the cherubim at the two ends of it from one piece with the mercy seat.
And the cherubim shall spread over their wings above, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces one toward another; the faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat.
You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you.
And there I will meet with you, and I will speak with you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the Testimony, everything which I will command you concerning the children of Israel.
You shall also make a table of acacia wood; two cubits shall be its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height.
And you shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a molding of gold all around.
You shall make for it a rim of a handbreadth all around, and you shall make a gold molding for the rim all around.
And you shall make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that are at its four legs.
The rings shall be close to the rim, as housings for the poles to carry the table.
And you shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be carried with them.
You shall make its dishes, its pans, its pitchers, and its bowls for pouring. You shall make them of pure gold.
And you shall set the Bread of the Presence on the table before Me continually.
You shall also make a lampstand of pure gold; the lampstand shall be of hammered work. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its bulbs, and flowers shall be one piece.
And six branches shall come out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side.
Three bowls shall be made like almond blossoms on one branch, each with a bulb and a flower, and three bowls made like almond blossoms on the other branch, each with a bulb and a flower; and so for the six branches that come out of the lampstand.
On the lampstand itself shall be four bowls like almond blossoms, each with its bulb and flower.
And there shall be a bulb under the first two branches of it, a bulb under the second two branches of it, and a bulb under the third two branches of it, according to the six branches that extend from the lampstand.
Their bulbs and their branches shall be of one piece; all of it shall be one hammered piece of pure gold.
You shall make seven lamps for it, and they shall arrange its lamps so that they give light in front of it.
And its snuffers and snuff dishes shall be of pure gold.
It shall be made of a talent of pure gold, with all these utensils.
And see to it that you make them according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain.
Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twisted linen of violet, purple, and scarlet thread; with cherubim of quality workmanship you shall make them.
The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; one measurement for all the curtains.
Five curtains shall be joined to one another, and the other five curtains shall be joined to one another.
And you shall make loops of violet material on the edge of the one curtain on the extremity at the joint, and likewise you shall do on the outer edge of the other curtain at the second joint.
Fifty loops you shall make on the one curtain, and fifty loops you shall make on the edge of the curtain that is on the end of the second joint, that the loops may fit to one another.
And you shall make fifty hooks of gold, and join the curtains together with the hooks, so that it may be one tabernacle.
You shall also make curtains of goats’ hair, to be a tent over the tabernacle. You shall make eleven curtains.
The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; one measurement for the eleven curtains.
And you shall join five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves, and you shall double over the sixth curtain at the front of the face of the tent.
You shall make fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost at the one joint, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain at the second joint.
And you shall make fifty bronze hooks, put the hooks into the loops, and join the tent together, that it may be one.
The remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle.
And a cubit on one side and a cubit on the other side, of what remains of the length of the curtains of the tent, shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle, on this side and on that side, to cover it.
You shall also make a covering of ram skins dyed red for the tent, and a covering of badger skins above that.
And for the tabernacle you shall make the boards of acacia wood, standing upright.
Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the width of each board.
Two tenons shall be in each board to join one to another. Thus you shall do for all the boards of the tabernacle.
And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side.
You shall make forty sockets of silver for the twenty boards: two sockets for each of the boards for its two tenons.
And for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, twenty boards
and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets for each of the boards.
For the side of the tabernacle, westward, you shall make six boards.
And you shall also make two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
They shall be joined together at the bottom and they shall be joined together at the top by one ring. Thus it shall be for both of them. They shall be for the two corners.
Thus there shall be eight boards with their sockets of silver; sixteen sockets; two sockets for each board.
And you shall make bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,
five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the side westward.
The middle bar shall pass through the midst of the boards from end to end.
You shall overlay the boards with gold, make their rings of gold as housings for the bars, and overlay the bars with gold.
And you shall erect the tabernacle according to the ordinance which you were shown on the mountain.
You shall make a veil of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen. It shall be done with cherubim of quality workmanship.
You shall hang it upon four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be gold, upon four sockets of silver.
And you shall hang the veil from the hooks. And you shall bring the ark of the Testimony in there, inside the veil. The veil shall divide for you between the holy and the Holy of Holies.
You shall put the mercy seat upon the ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies.
And you shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand across from the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and you shall put the table on the north side.
And you shall make a screen for the opening of the tent, of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen, the product of skillful weaving.
And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five sockets of bronze for them.
And you shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square; and its height three cubits.
And you shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it. And you shall overlay it with bronze.
Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze.
You shall make a grating for it, a network of bronze; and on the network you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners.
You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar.
And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.
And the poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar to carry it.
You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown you on the mountain, thus shall they make it.
You shall also make the court of the tabernacle. For the south side there shall be hangings for the court made of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long for one side.
And its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be silver.
Likewise along the length of the north side there shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, with its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze, and the hooks of the pillars and their bands of silver.
And along the width of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits, with their ten pillars and their ten sockets.
The width of the court on the east side shall be fifty cubits.
The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
And on the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
For the gate of the court there shall be a screen twenty cubits long, of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen, the product of skillful weaving; with four pillars and four sockets.
All the pillars around the court shall have bands of silver; their hooks of silver and their sockets of bronze.
The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, the width fifty to fifty, and the height five cubits, made of fine twisted linen, and its sockets of bronze.
All the utensils of the tabernacle for all its service, all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze.
And you shall command the children of Israel that they bring you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to cause the flame of the lamp to ascend continually.
In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall arrange it from evening until morning before Jehovah. It shall be a perpetual statute to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel.
Now take Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the sons of Israel, that he may serve Me as priest, Aaron and Aaron’s sons: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.
And you shall speak to all who are wise-hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron’s garments, to consecrate him to serve as priest unto Me.
And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, an ephod, a robe, a tunic of woven work, a turban, and a sash. And they shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother and his sons, to serve as priests unto Me.
They shall take the gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen,
and they shall make the ephod of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen; the product of skillful work.
It shall have two shoulder pieces joined at its two edges, and thus it shall be joined together.
And the intricately woven band of the ephod, which is on it, shall be of the same workmanship, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen.
And you shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel:
six of their names on one stone, and six names on the other stone, according to their birth.
With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones with the names of the sons of Israel. You shall set them in settings of gold.
And you shall put the two stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Thus Aaron shall bear their names before Jehovah on his two shoulders as a memorial.
You shall also make settings of gold,
and you shall make two chains of pure gold like the product of braiding, and fasten the braided chains to the settings.
You shall make the breastplate of judgment. The product of skillful work, according to the workmanship of the ephod you shall make it: of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen, you shall make it.
It shall be folded into a square: a span shall be its length, and a span shall be its width.
And you shall put settings of stones in it, four rows of stones: The first row shall be a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald; this the first row.
The second row shall be a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be set in gold settings.
And the stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name, according to the twelve tribes.
You shall make chains for the breastplate, the work of twisted cords of pure gold.
And you shall make two rings of gold for the breastplate, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
And you shall put the two cords of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate;
and the other two ends of the two cords you shall fasten to the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod in the front.
And you shall make two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, on the inner side of the ephod.
And two rings of gold you shall make, and put them on the two shoulder pieces, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod.
And they shall bind the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod, with a violet cord, so that it is above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and so that the breastplate does not come loose from the ephod.
And Aaron shall bear the names of the sons of Israel on the breastplate of judgment over his heart, when he goes into the holy place, as a memorial before Jehovah continually.
And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be over Aaron’s heart when he goes in before Jehovah. Thus Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel over his heart before Jehovah continually.
And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of violet.
There shall be an opening for his head in the middle of it; it shall have an edge of woven work all around its opening, like the opening in a coat of mail, so that it does not tear.
And on its hem you shall make pomegranates of violet, purple, and scarlet, all around its hem, and bells of gold between them all around:
a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, on the hem of the robe all around.
And it shall be upon Aaron when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before Jehovah and when he comes out, that he not die.
You shall also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet: HOLY TO JEHOVAH.
And you shall put it on a violet cord, that it may be on the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban.
Thus it shall be on Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of Israel consecrate in all their holy gifts; and it shall be on his forehead continually, that they may be accepted before Jehovah.
You shall weave the tunic of fine linen, you shall make the turban of fine linen, and you shall make the sash a product of skillful weaving.
And for Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics, and you shall make sashes for them. And you shall make turbans for them, for glory and beauty.
Thus you shall clothe Aaron your brother with them, and his sons with him. You shall anoint them, confirm their hands, and consecrate them, that they may serve Me as priests.
And you shall make for them linen trousers to cover their naked flesh; they shall reach from the hips to the thighs.
And they shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they come into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister in the holy place, that they not bear iniquity and die. It shall be a perpetual statute to him and his seed after him.
And this is what you shall do to them to consecrate them to serve Me as priests: Take one young bull and two rams that are whole,
and unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil; you shall make them of fine wheat flour.
You shall put them into one basket and bring them in the basket, with the bull and the two rams.
And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tent of meeting, and you shall wash them with water.
And you shall take the garments, put the tunic on Aaron, and the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the intricately woven band of the ephod.
You shall put the turban on his head, and put the holy crown upon the turban.
And you shall take the anointing oil, pour it upon his head, and anoint him.
And you shall bring his sons and put tunics on them.
And you shall gird them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and bind the turbans on them. The priesthood shall be theirs for a perpetual statute. Thus you shall confirm the hands of Aaron and his sons.
You shall also have the bull brought before the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.
And you shall kill the bull before Jehovah, by the door of the tent of meeting.
You shall take some of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out all the blood at the base of the altar.
And you shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar like incense.
But the flesh of the bull, with its skin and its dung, you shall burn with fire outside the camp. It is a sin offering.
You shall also take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram;
and you shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it all around on the altar.
And you shall cut the ram in pieces, wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and with its head.
And you shall burn the whole ram on the altar like incense. It is a burnt offering unto Jehovah; it is a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
You shall also take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
And you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and on the tip of the right ear of his sons, on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar.
And you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him. Thus he and his garments shall be consecrated, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
Also you shall take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and the fat on them, the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),
one loaf of bread, one cake made with oil, and one wafer from the basket of the unleavened bread that is before Jehovah;
and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and you shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.
And you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar like incense as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma before Jehovah. It is an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination and wave it as a wave offering before Jehovah; and it shall be your portion.
And from the ram of the ordination you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering which is waved, and the thigh of the heave offering which is raised, of that which is for Aaron and of that which is for his sons.
It shall be for Aaron and his sons from the children of Israel as a perpetual statute; for it is a heave offering. It shall be a heave offering from the children of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, their heave offering unto Jehovah.
And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to be anointed in them and to confirm their hands in them.
That son who becomes priest in his place shall put them on for seven days, when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
And you shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in the consecrated place.
And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tent of meeting.
They shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to confirm their hands and to consecrate; but a stranger shall not eat them, because they are holy.
And if any of the flesh of ordination, or of the bread, remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
Thus you shall do to Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. Seven days you shall confirm their hands.
And you shall offer a bull every day as a sin offering for atonement. You shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it.
Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. And the altar shall be set apart, holy. Whatever touches the altar is consecrated.
And this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.
One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at evening.
With the one lamb shall be one-tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
And the other lamb you shall offer at evening; and you shall offer with it the grain offering and the drink offering, as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, where I will meet you to speak with you.
And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and it shall be honored by My glory.
Thus I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar. I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons unto Me as priests.
I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them. I am Jehovah their God.
You shall make an altar on which to burn incense; you shall make it of acacia wood.
A cubit shall be its length and a cubit its width; it shall be square; and two cubits shall be its height. Its horns shall be from the same piece.
And you shall overlay its top, its sides all around, and its horns with pure gold; and you shall make for it a molding of gold all around.
Two gold rings you shall make for it, under the molding on both its sides. You shall place them on its two sides, and they shall be housings for the poles with which to carry it.
You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
And you shall put it in front of the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you.
Aaron shall burn spiced incense on it every morning; when he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.
And when Aaron stirs up the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.
You shall not offer strange incense on it, nor a burnt offering, nor a grain offering; nor shall you pour out a drink offering upon it.
And Aaron shall make atonement upon its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement; once a year he shall make atonement upon it throughout your generations. It is set apart, holy, unto Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
When you take a head count of the sons of Israel in numbering them, each man shall give a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah when you number them, that there may be no plague among them when you number them.
This is what everyone passing over to be numbered shall give: half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (a shekel is twenty gerahs). The half-shekel shall be an offering unto Jehovah.
Everyone passing over to be numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto Jehovah.
The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give an offering unto Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
And you shall take the money of atonement from the sons of Israel, and shall designate it for the service of the tent of meeting, that it may be a memorial for the sons of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
You shall also make a laver of bronze, its base also of bronze, with which to wash. You shall put it between the tent of meeting and the altar. And you shall put water in it,
for Aaron and his sons to wash their hands and their feet there.
When they go into the tent of meeting, or when they come near the altar to minister, to burn an offering by fire like incense unto Jehovah, they shall wash with water, that they not die.
Thus they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. And it shall be a perpetual statute to them; to him and his seed throughout their generations.
Moreover Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying:
Take for yourself choice spices; five hundred shekels of flowing myrrh, half as much sweet-smelling cinnamon (two hundred and fifty shekels), two hundred and fifty shekels of sweet-smelling calamus,
five hundred shekels of cassia, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, and a hin of olive oil.
And you shall make from these a holy anointing oil, an ointment compound the product of the perfumer. It shall be a holy anointing oil.
With it you shall anoint the tent of meeting and the ark of the Testimony;
the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense;
the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base.
You shall consecrate them, that they may be set apart, holy. Whatever touches them is holy.
And you shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, to serve Me as priests.
And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: This shall be a holy anointing oil unto Me throughout your generations.
It shall not be poured upon man’s flesh; nor shall you make any other like it, according to its proportions. It is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.
Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever gives any of it to a stranger, shall be cut off from his people.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Take spices; stacte and onycha and galbanum, and pure frankincense with these incense spices; part equal to part.
You shall make of these an incense, a spice mixture the product of the perfumer, salted, pure, and holy.
And you shall pulverize some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the tent of meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be set apart, holy, unto you.
And the incense which you make, you shall not make any for yourselves according to its proportions. It shall be holy unto you for Jehovah.
Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Observe that I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
to devise designs, to work in gold, in silver, in bronze,
in cutting stones to finish them, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of workmanship.
And I, behold I, have appointed with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and I have given wisdom into the hearts of all the wise-hearted, that they may produce all that I have commanded you:
the tent of meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat that is on it, and all the implements of the tent;
the table and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,
the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the laver and its base;
the woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests,
and the anointing oil and spiced incense for the holy place. According to all that I have commanded you they shall do.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak also to the children of Israel, saying: Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.
You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who violates it shall be executed to death; for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Work may be done six days, but the seventh is the the rest of Sabbath observance, holy unto Jehovah. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall be executed to death.
Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.
It is a perpetual sign between Me and the children of Israel; for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.
And when He had made an end of speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.
Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together to Aaron, and said to him, Arise, make us gods that shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.
So all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
And he took up the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool after he had made a molten calf. And they said, This is your god, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt!
And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow is a feast unto Jehovah.
And they arose early the next day, offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Go! Get down! For your people whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.
They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and bowed down to it and sacrificed to it, and said, This is your god, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt!
And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiff-necked people!
Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn against them, that I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.
And Moses entreated the face of Jehovah his God, and said: Jehovah, why does Your wrath burn against Your people whom You have brought up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, He brought them out to harm them, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn away from Your burning wrath, and have compassion regarding this evil to Your people.
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens; and all this land that I have spoken of I give to your seed, and they shall always possess it.
And Jehovah was moved to compassion from the evil which He had spoken to do unto His people.
And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. The tablets were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.
And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
And when Joshua heard the sound of the people of their shouting, he said to Moses, It is a sound of war in the camp.
And he said: It is not the sound of the shout of victory, nor the sound of the cry of defeat, but the sound of singing I am hearing.
And it came to pass, as soon as he came near the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, that Moses’ anger was kindled, and he cast the tablets out of his hands and broke them at the base of the mountain.
And he took the calf which they had made, burned it with fire, and ground it fine, and scattered it on the water and made the children of Israel drink it.
And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?
And Aaron said, Do not let the anger of my lord be kindled. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
For they said to me, Make us gods that shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me, and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.
And when Moses saw that the people were lacking restraint (for Aaron had let them loose, to the derision of their enemies),
that Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.
And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Let every man put his sword on his side, and go and return from gate to gate throughout the camp, and let every man kill his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And about three thousand men of the people fell that day.
And Moses said, Fulfill your hand today unto Jehovah, that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day, for every man has been against his son and his brother.
And it came to pass on the next day that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.
And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Oh, these people have sinned a great sin, and have made for themselves a god of gold!
Yet now, if You will, take away their sin; and if not, I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.
Now therefore, go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will punish them for their sin.
And Jehovah plagued the people because they had made the calf which Aaron had made.
And Jehovah said unto Moses, Depart and go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed I will give it.
And I will send an Angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest I consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.
And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments.
For Jehovah had said to Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people. I should come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your ornaments, that I may know what to do with you.
So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.
And Moses took the tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and called it the tent of meeting. And it came to pass that everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.
And it came to pass, whenever Moses went out to the tent, that all the people rose, and each man stood at his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tent.
And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tent, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door of the tent, and spoke with Moses.
And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the tent, and all the people arose and prostrated themselves, each man at the opening of his tent.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, and his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent.
And Moses said unto Jehovah, Consider how You say to me, Bring up this people. But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My eyes.
Now therefore, I pray, if I have found favor in Your eyes, show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find favor in Your eyes. And consider that this nation is Your people.
And He said, My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.
And he said unto Him, If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.
For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your eyes, except You go with us? So we shall be distinct, Your people and I, from all the people who are upon the face of the earth.
And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found favor in My eyes, and I know you by name.
And he said, Please, let me see Your glory.
And He said, I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
But He said, You are not able to see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.
And Jehovah said, Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock.
So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by.
Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke.
And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and station yourself next to Me there on the top of the mountain.
And no man shall come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.
And he cut two tablets of stone like the first ones. And Moses arose early in the morning and went up into Mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.
And Jehovah descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
And Jehovah passed before him and proclaimed: Jehovah, Jehovah Mighty God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and the sons’ sons to the third and the fourth generation.
And Moses made haste and bowed down toward the earth, and prostrated himself.
And he said, If now I have found favor in Your eyes, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we are a stiff-necked people; and forgive our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your possession.
And He said: Behold, I make a covenant. Before all your people I will do extraordinary things such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Jehovah. For it is an awesome thing that I will do with you.
Observe what I command you this day. Behold, I am driving out before you the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
Take heed to yourself, that you not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, that it not be a snare in your midst.
But you shall destroy their altars, break their sacred pillars, and chop down their groves
(for you shall bow down to no other god, for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous Mighty God),
that you not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and you go whoring after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and they invite you and you eat of their sacrifices,
and you take of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters go whoring after their gods and make your sons go whoring after their gods.
You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.
The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded you, at the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.
Everything that opens the womb is Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, whether ox or sheep.
But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem him, then you shall break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. And no one shall appear before Me empty.
Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.
And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah the God of Israel.
For I will dispossess the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before Jehovah your God three times in the year.
You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning.
The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring unto the house of Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Write these words; according to these words at My mouth, I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.
And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.
And it came to pass, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (the two tablets of the Testimony being in Moses’ hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while He spoke with him.
And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him.
And Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke with them.
And afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he commanded them with all that Jehovah had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.
And when Moses was finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
But whenever Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with Him, he took the veil off until he came out; and he came out and spoke to the children of Israel whatever he was commanded.
And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.
And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded you to do:
Work shall be done six days, but the seventh day shall be holy for you, a rest of Sabbath observance unto Jehovah. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.
You shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings on the Sabbath day.
And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, saying:
Take from among you an offering unto Jehovah. Everyone of a willing heart, let him bring it as an offering of Jehovah: gold, silver, and bronze;
violet, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats’ hair;
ram skins dyed red, badger skins, and acacia wood;
oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil and for the spiced incense;
onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate.
All who are wise-hearted among you shall come and make all that Jehovah has commanded:
the tabernacle, its tent, its covering, its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
the ark and its poles, with the mercy seat, and the veil of the covering;
the table and its poles, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;
also the lampstand for the light, its utensils, its lamps, and the oil for the light;
the incense altar, its poles, the anointing oil, the spiced incense, and the screen for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle;
the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, all its utensils, and the laver and its base;
the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
the pegs of the tabernacle, the pegs of the court, and their cords;
the woven garments for service in the holy place; the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
And everyone came whose heart was raised up, and everyone whose spirit was willing, and they brought the offering of Jehovah for the work of the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments.
And they came, both men and women, everyone of a willing heart, and brought bracelets and nose rings, rings and ornaments, all sorts of gold articles, everyone who made an offering of gold unto Jehovah.
And everyone with whom was found violet, purple, and scarlet thread, fine linen, and goats’ hair, red skins of rams, and badger skins, brought them.
Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the offering of Jehovah. And everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
And all the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, of violet, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.
And all the women whose hearts were raised up with wisdom spun goats’ hair.
And the leaders brought onyx stones, and the stones to be set in the ephod and in the breastplate,
and spices and oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the spiced incense.
The children of Israel brought a freewill offering unto Jehovah, every man and woman whose heart was willing to bring for all the work which Jehovah, by the hand of Moses, had commanded to be done.
And Moses said to the children of Israel, Behold, Jehovah has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, in knowledge and all manner of workmanship,
to devise designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze,
in cutting stones for setting, in carving wood, and to work in all manner of designed workmanship.
And He has put in his heart to teach, in him and Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
He has filled them with wisdom of heart to do all manner of work of the engraver and the designer and the tapestry maker, in violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen, and of the weaver; those who do every work and those who devise designs.
And Bezalel and Aholiab, and everyone of wise heart in whom Jehovah has put wisdom and understanding, to know how to do all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, shall do according to all that Jehovah has commanded.
And Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted one in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, everyone whose heart was raised up to come and do the work.
And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of making the sanctuary. And they continued bringing to him freewill offerings every morning.
And all the wise men who were doing all the work of the sanctuary came, each from the work he was doing,
and they spoke to Moses, saying, The people are bringing more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah has commanded us to do.
And Moses commanded, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. And the people were restrained from bringing,
for the material they had was sufficient for all the work to be done; indeed too much.
And all the wise-hearted among them who worked on the tabernacle made ten curtains woven of fine linen, and of violet, purple, and scarlet thread; with cherubim of quality workmanship they made them.
The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the curtains were all of one measurement.
And he joined five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he joined to one another.
He made loops of violet on the edge of the curtain on the end at one joint; likewise he did on the outer edge of the other curtain at the second joint.
Fifty loops he made on one curtain, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain at the end of the second joint; the loops fit one curtain to another.
And he made fifty hooks of gold, and joined the curtains one to another with the hooks, that it might be one tabernacle.
He made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; the eleven curtains were of one measurement.
He joined five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that is outermost at the one joint, and fifty loops he made on the edge of the curtain at the second joint.
He also made fifty bronze hooks to join the tent together, that it might be one.
And he made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and a covering of badger skins above that.
For the tabernacle he made boards of acacia wood, standing upright.
The length of each board was ten cubits, and the width of each board a cubit and a half.
Each board had two tenons for joining one to another. Thus he did for all the boards of the tabernacle.
And he made boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side.
Forty sockets of silver he made to go under the twenty boards: two sockets under each board for its two tenons.
And for the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards
and their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under each board.
For the west side of the tabernacle he made six boards.
He also made two boards for the two back corners of the tabernacle.
And they were joined at the bottom and joined together at the top by one ring. Thus he made both of them for the two corners.
And there were eight boards and their sockets; sixteen sockets of silver; two sockets under each board.
And he made bars of acacia wood: five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle,
five bars for the boards on the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the side westward.
And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from end to end.
He overlaid the boards with gold, made their rings of gold as housings for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
And he made a veil of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen; it was done with cherubim of quality workmanship.
He made for it four pillars of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them.
He also made a screen for the opening of the tent, of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine twisted linen, the product of skillful weaving,
and its five pillars with their hooks. And he overlaid their tops and their bands with gold, and their five sockets were bronze.
And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood; two and a half cubits was its length, a cubit and a half its width, and a cubit and a half its height.
He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made a molding of gold all around it.
And he cast for it four rings of gold to be set in its four feet: two rings on one side, and two rings on the other side of it.
He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
And he put the poles into the rings at the sides of the ark, to carry the ark.
He also made the mercy seat of pure gold; two and a half cubits was its length and a cubit and a half its width.
He made two cherubim of hammered gold; he made them at the two ends of the mercy seat:
one cherub at one end on this side, and the other cherub at the other end on that side. He made the cherubim at the two ends of one piece with the mercy seat.
The cherubim spread out their wings above, and covered the mercy seat with their wings. They faced one another; the faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
He made the table of acacia wood; two cubits was its length, a cubit its width, and a cubit and a half its height.
And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a molding of gold all around it.
He also made a rim of a handbreadth all around it, and made a molding of gold for the rim all around it.
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings on the four corners that were at its four legs.
The rings were close to the rim, as housings for the poles to carry the table.
And he made the poles of acacia wood to carry the table, and overlaid them with gold.
He made of pure gold the utensils which were on the table: its dishes, its pans, its bowls, and its pitchers for pouring.
He also made the lampstand of pure gold; of hammered work he made the lampstand. Its shaft, its branches, its bowls, its bulbs, and its flowers were one piece.
And six branches came out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of the other side.
There were three bowls made like almond blossoms on one branch, with a bulb and a flower, and three bowls made like almond blossoms on the other branch, with a bulb and a flower; and thus for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.
And on the lampstand itself were four bowls made like almond blossoms, each with its bulb and flower.
There was a bulb under the first two branches of it, a bulb under the second two branches of it, and a bulb under the third two branches of it, according to the six branches extending from it.
Their bulbs and their branches were of one piece; all of it was one hammered piece of pure gold.
And he made its seven lamps, its snuffers, and its snuff dishes of pure gold.
Of a talent of pure gold he made it, with all its utensils.
He made the incense altar of acacia wood. Its length was a cubit and its width a cubit; it was square; and two cubits was its height. Its horns were of one piece with it.
And he overlaid it with pure gold: its top, its sides all around, and its horns. He also made for it a molding of gold all around it.
He made two rings of gold for it under its molding, by its two corners on both sides, as housings for the poles with which to carry it.
And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of spices, the product of the perfumer.
He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood; five cubits was its length and five cubits its width; it was square; and its height was three cubits.
He made its horns on its four corners; the horns were of one piece with it. And he overlaid it with bronze.
He made all the utensils for the altar: the pans, the shovels, the basins, the forks, and the firepans; all its utensils he made of bronze.
And he made a grating of bronze network for the altar, under its rim, midway from the bottom.
He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating, as housings for the poles.
And he made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with bronze.
And he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made the altar hollow with boards.
He made the laver of bronze and its base of bronze, from the bronze mirrors of the serving women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.
And he made the court on the south side; the hangings of the court were of fine twisted linen, one hundred cubits long.
There were twenty pillars for them, with twenty bronze sockets. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver.
On the north side the hangings were one hundred cubits long, with twenty pillars and their twenty bronze sockets. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver.
And on the west side there were hangings of fifty cubits, with ten pillars and their ten sockets. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver.
For the east side the hangings were fifty cubits.
The hangings of one side of the gate were fifteen cubits long, with their three pillars and their three sockets,
and the same for the other side of the court gate; on this side and that were hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets.
All the hangings of the court all around were of fine twisted linen.
The sockets for the pillars were bronze, the hooks of the pillars and their bands were silver, and the overlay of their tops was silver; and all the pillars of the court were banded with silver.
The screen for the gate of the court was the product of skillful weaving of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine twisted linen. The length was twenty cubits, and the height along its width was five cubits, corresponding to the hangings of the court.
And there were four pillars with their four sockets of bronze; their hooks were silver, and the overlay of their tops and their bands was silver.
All the pegs of the tabernacle, and of the court all around, were bronze.
This is the reckoning of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which was counted according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.
Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And with him was Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and designer, a skillful weaver of violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine linen.
All the gold that was used in all the work of the holy place, that is, the gold of the offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
And the silver from those who were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
a bekah per head (that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary), for everyone passing over to be numbered from twenty years old and above, for six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
And from the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil: one hundred sockets from the hundred talents, one talent per socket.
And from the one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their tops, and banded them.
The offering of bronze was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels.
And with it he made the sockets for the door of the tent of meeting, the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, and all the utensils for the altar,
the sockets for the court all around, the bases for the court gate, all the pegs for the tabernacle, and all the pegs for the court all around.
Of the violet, purple, and scarlet thread they made woven garments, to serve in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He made the ephod of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine twisted linen.
And they beat the gold into thin sheets and cut it into threads, to work it in with the violet, purple, and scarlet thread and the fine linen, products of skillful designs.
They made shoulder pieces for it to join it together; it was joined together at its two edges.
And the intricately woven band of his ephod that was on it was of the same workmanship, woven of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine twisted linen, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And they set onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold; they were engraved, as signets are engraved, with the names of the sons of Israel.
He put them on the shoulders of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he made the breastplate, the product of skillful work, like the workmanship of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple, and scarlet thread, and of fine twisted linen.
They made the breastplate square by folding it; a span was its length and a span its width when folded.
And they set in it four rows of stones: a row with a ruby, a topaz, and an emerald was the first row;
the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;
the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in settings of gold in their mountings.
There were twelve stones according to the names of the sons of Israel; according to their names, engraved like a signet, each one with its own name according to the twelve tribes.
And they made chains for the breastplate at the ends, the product of braiding, of pure gold.
They also made two settings of gold and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
And they put the two cords of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.
The two ends of the two braided cords they fastened in the two settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod in the front.
And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was on the inward side of the ephod.
They made two other gold rings and put them on the two shoulder pieces, underneath the ephod toward its front, right at the seam above the intricately woven band of the ephod.
And they bound the breastplate by means of its rings to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so that it would be above the intricately woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate would not come loose from the ephod, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of violet.
And there was an opening in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of mail, with an edge around the opening, so that it would not tear.
They made on the hem of the robe pomegranates of violet, purple, and scarlet, and of fine twisted linen.
And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates on the hem of the robe all around between the pomegranates:
a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe to serve in, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
They made tunics of woven work of fine linen, for Aaron and his sons,
a turban of fine linen, ornamental turbans of fine linen, trousers of fine twisted linen,
and a sash of fine twisted linen with violet, purple, and scarlet thread, the product of a skillful weaver, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription like the engravings of a signet: HOLY TO JEHOVAH.
And they tied to it a violet cord, to set it above on the turban, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting was finished. And the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses; thus they did.
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent and all its articles: its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of badger skins, and the veil of the covering;
the ark of the Testimony with its poles, and the mercy seat;
the table, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence;
the pure gold lampstand with its lamps (the lamps set in order), all its utensils, and the oil for light;
the gold altar, the anointing oil, and the spiced incense; the screen for the tent opening;
the bronze altar, its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils; the laver with its base;
the hangings of the court, its pillars and its sockets, the screen for the court gate, its cords, and its pegs; all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
and the woven garments, to serve in the holy place: the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to serve as priests.
According to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, thus the children of Israel did all the work.
And Moses inspected all the work, and indeed they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, thus they had done it. And Moses blessed them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
On the first day of the first month you shall set up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
You shall put in it the ark of the Testimony, and screen the ark with the veil.
You shall bring in the table and arrange the things that are to be set in order upon it; and you shall bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.
You shall also set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the Testimony, and set up the screen for the door of the tabernacle.
And you shall set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
And you shall set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.
You shall set up the court all around, and put up the screen at the court gate.
And you shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it; and you shall consecrate it and all its utensils, and it shall be holy.
You shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar. The altar shall be set apart, holy.
And you shall anoint the laver and its base, and consecrate it.
And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
You shall put the holy garments on Aaron, and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve Me as priest.
And you shall bring his sons and clothe them with tunics.
You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father, and they shall serve Me as priests; for their anointing shall be a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.
Thus Moses did; according to all that Jehovah had commanded him, so he did.
And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was raised up.
And Moses raised up the tabernacle, set its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars.
And he spread out the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he took the Testimony and put it into the ark, inserted the poles through the rings of the ark, and put the mercy seat on the ark from above.
And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil of the covering, and screened the ark of the Testimony, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil;
and he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the tabernacle;
and he lit the lamps before Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He put the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil;
and he burned spiced incense on it, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He set up the screen at the door of the tabernacle.
And he put the altar of burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the grain offering, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
He set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water there with which to wash;
and Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.
Whenever they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near the altar, they washed, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the screen of the court gate. Thus Moses finished the work.
And the cloud covered over the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud had settled down upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel would set out in all their journeys.
But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey till the day that it was taken up.
For the cloud of Jehovah was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If any one of you brings an offering unto Jehovah, you shall bring your offering of the livestock; of the herd and of the flock.
If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd, let him offer a male that is whole; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah.
And he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
He shall kill the young bull before Jehovah; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood all around on the altar that is by the door of the tent of meeting.
And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay the wood in order on the fire.
And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat in order upon the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;
but he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar with smoke as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
If his offering is of the flocks, of the sheep or of the goats, as a burnt offering, he shall bring a male that is whole.
He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before Jehovah; and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle its blood all around upon the altar.
And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order upon the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;
but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water. And the priest shall bring it all and burn it upon the altar with smoke; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And if the burnt offering of his offering unto Jehovah is of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons.
The priest shall bring it to the altar, nip off its head, and burn it on the altar with smoke; its blood shall be drained out at the side of the altar.
And he shall remove its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar on the east side, into the place for ashes.
And he shall cleave it at its wings, but shall not divide it completely; and the priest shall burn it on the altar with smoke, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
When anyone offers a grain offering unto Jehovah, his offering shall be of fine flour. And he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.
He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests, one of whom shall take from it a full handful of fine flour and oil with all the frankincense. And the priest shall burn it as a memorial on the altar with smoke, an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
The rest of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons. Of the offerings unto Jehovah by fire, it is set apart, holy.
And if you bring as an offering a grain offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
And if your offering is a grain offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour, unleavened, mixed with oil.
You shall break it in pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
If your offering is a grain offering baked in a sauce pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
You shall bring the grain offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah. And when it has been presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
And the priest shall take from the grain offering a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar with smoke. It is an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And what is left of the grain offering shall be for Aaron and his sons. Of the offerings unto Jehovah by fire, it is set apart, holy.
No grain offering which you bring to Jehovah shall be made with leaven, for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey with smoke in any offering unto Jehovah by fire.
As for the offering of the firstfruits, you shall offer them unto Jehovah, but they shall not be burned on the altar for a soothing aroma.
And every offering of your grain offerings you shall season with salt; you shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your grain offerings. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.
If you offer a grain offering of your firstfruits unto Jehovah, you shall offer for the grain offering of your firstfruits green heads of grain roasted with fire, grain beaten out from full heads.
And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it. It is a grain offering.
And the priest shall burn the memorial portion with smoke: part of its beaten grain and part of its oil, with all the frankincense, as an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer one that is whole before Jehovah.
And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood all around on the altar.
And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering by fire unto Jehovah. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;
and Aaron’s sons shall burn it with smoke on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire, as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
If his offering as a sacrifice of a peace offerings unto Jehovah is of the flock, whether male or female, he shall offer one that is whole.
If he offers a lamb as his offering, then he shall offer it before Jehovah.
And he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.
And he shall offer from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as an offering by fire unto Jehovah, its fat and the whole fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone. And the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;
and the priest shall burn them with smoke on the altar as a food offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah.
He shall lay his hand on its head and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood all around on the altar.
And he shall offer from it his offering, as an offering by fire unto Jehovah. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,
the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;
and the priest shall burn them on the altar with smoke as a food offering by fire for a soothing aroma; all the fat is Jehovah’s.
This shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings: you shall eat neither fat nor blood.
And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a soul sins unintentionally against any of the commandments of Jehovah in anything which ought not to be done, and does any of them,
if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt upon the people, then let him present unto Jehovah for his sin which he has sinned a young bull that is whole, as a sin offering.
He shall bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah, lay his hand on the bull’s head, and kill the bull before Jehovah.
And the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring it to the tent of meeting.
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before Jehovah, in front of the veil of the holy place.
And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of spiced incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and he shall pour the remaining blood of the bull at the base of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
He shall take from it all the fat of the bull as the sin offering. The fat that covers the entrails and all the fat which is on the entrails,
the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove,
as it was taken from the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn them with smoke upon the altar of the burnt offering.
But the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and legs, its entrails and dung;
the whole bull he shall bring outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.
And if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done something against any of the commandments of Jehovah in anything which should not be done, and are guilty;
when the sin which they have sinned becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a young bull for the sin, and bring it before the tent of meeting.
And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before Jehovah, and the bull shall be killed before Jehovah.
The anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the tent of meeting.
And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, in front of the veil.
And he shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and he shall pour the remaining blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
He shall take all the fat from it and burn it on the altar with smoke.
And he shall do with the bull as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. Thus the priest shall make atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
And he shall bring the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull. It is a sin offering for the assembly.
When a ruler has sinned, and done something unintentionally against any of the commandments of Jehovah his God in anything which should not be done, and is guilty,
or if his sin which he has sinned comes to his knowledge, he shall bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a male that is whole.
And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it at the place where they kill the burnt offering before Jehovah. It is a sin offering.
And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
And he shall burn all its fat on the altar with smoke, like the fat of the sacrifice of the peace offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
If any soul of the people of the land sins unintentionally by doing something against any of the commandments of Jehovah in anything which ought not to be done, and is guilty,
or if his sin which he has sinned comes to his knowledge, then he shall bring as his offering a kid of the goats, a female that is whole, for his sin which he has sinned.
And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.
And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining blood at the base of the altar.
He shall remove all its fat, as fat is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall burn it on the altar with smoke for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he shall bring a female that is whole.
And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and kill it as a sin offering at the place where they kill the burnt offering.
The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour all the remaining blood at the base of the altar.
He shall remove all its fat, as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering. And the priest shall burn it on the altar with smoke, according to the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. Thus the priest shall make atonement for his sin that he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
If a soul sins and has heard the utterance of an oath, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of the matter; if he does not report it, he bears guilt.
Or if a soul touches any unclean thing, whether it is the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and he is unaware of it, he also shall be unclean and guilty.
Or if he touches human uncleanness; whatever uncleanness with which a man may be defiled, and he is unaware of it; when he has found out about it, then he shall be guilty.
Or if a soul swears, speaking thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man may speak rashly with an oath, and it is concealed from him; when he has found out about it, then he shall be guilty in any of these matters.
And it shall be, when he is guilty in any of these matters, that he shall confess that he has sinned;
and he shall bring his trespass offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats as a sin offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin.
If he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring unto Jehovah, for his guilt which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons: one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and nip off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it completely.
And he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. Thus the priest shall make atonement for his sin which he has sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
And if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he who sinned shall bring for his offering one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. He shall put no oil on it, nor shall he put frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.
And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his full handful of it as a memorial portion, and burn it on the altar with smoke according to the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. It is a sin offering.
The priest shall make atonement for him, for his sin that he has sinned in any of these matters; and it shall be forgiven him. The rest is for the priest as a grain offering.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
If a soul commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally in regard to the holy things of Jehovah, then he shall bring unto Jehovah for his trespass a ram that is whole from the flocks, with your valuation in shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, as a trespass offering.
And he shall make good for his sin with regard to the holy thing, and shall add one-fifth to it and give it to the priest. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
If a soul sins, and has done any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of Jehovah, though he does not know it, yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.
And he shall bring to the priest a ram that is whole from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him regarding his unintentional error in which he did not know it, and it shall be forgiven him.
It is a trespass offering; he has trespassed against Jehovah to become guilty.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
If a soul sins and commits a trespass against Jehovah by lying to his neighbor about what was delivered into his hand for safekeeping, or about a pledge, or about a robbery, or if he has extorted from his neighbor,
or if he has found what was lost and lies concerning it, and swears falsely; in any one of these things that a man may do in which he sins:
then it shall be, because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore what he has stolen, or the thing which he has extorted, or what was delivered to him for safekeeping, or the lost thing which he found,
or all that about which he has sworn falsely. He shall restore the principal, add one-fifth more to it, and give it to whomever it belongs, on the day of his guilt offering.
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto Jehovah, a ram that is whole from the flock, with your valuation, as a trespass offering, to the priest.
And the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah, and he shall be forgiven for any of these things that he has done in which he is guilty.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night until morning, and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers he shall put on his flesh, and take up the ashes of the burnt offering which the fire has consumed on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
And he shall take off his garments, put on other garments, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it shall not be put out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings with smoke.
The fire shall continually be burning on the altar; it shall never go out.
This is the law of the grain offering: The sons of Aaron shall present it before Jehovah in front of the altar.
And he shall take from it his handful of the fine flour of the grain offering, with its oil, and all the frankincense which is on the grain offering, and shall burn it on the altar with smoke for a soothing aroma, as a memorial unto Jehovah.
And the remainder of it Aaron and his sons shall eat; with unleavened bread it shall be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings by fire; it is set apart, holy; like the sin offering and the trespass offering.
All the males among the sons of Aaron shall eat it. It is a perpetual statute throughout your generations concerning the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. Everyone who touches them shall be holy.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
This is the offering for Aaron and his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah, on the day when he is anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a continual grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.
It shall be made in a pan with oil. You shall bring it in mixed, and the baked pieces of the grain offering you shall offer for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
The priest from among his sons, who is anointed in his place, shall do it. It is a perpetual statute unto Jehovah. It shall be completely burned with smoke;
for every grain offering for the priests shall be completely burned. It shall not be eaten.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before Jehovah. It is set apart, holy.
The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. In the holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Everyone who touches its flesh shall be holy. And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment, you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled, in the holy place.
But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken. And if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured and rinsed in water.
All the males among the priests shall eat of it. It is set apart, holy.
But the sin offering, from which any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting, to make atonement in the holy place, shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire.
Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering (it is set apart, holy):
In the place where they kill the burnt offering they shall kill the trespass offering. And its blood shall be sprinkled all around on the altar.
And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,
the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove;
and the priest shall burn them on the altar with smoke as an offering by fire unto Jehovah. It is a trespass offering.
Every male among the priests shall eat of it. It shall be eaten in the holy place. It is set apart, holy.
The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is one law for them both: it is for the priest who makes atonement with it.
And the priest who offers anyone’s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.
Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven and all that is prepared in the sauce pan, or in a pan, shall be for the priest who offers it.
Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil, or dry, shall be for all the sons of Aaron, for one as for the other.
This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which he shall offer unto Jehovah:
If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer, with the sacrifice of thanksgiving, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, or cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.
Besides the cakes, as his offering he shall offer leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering.
And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering as a heave offering unto Jehovah. It shall be for the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day it is offered. He shall not leave any of it until morning.
But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; and on the next day the remainder of it may also be eaten;
but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering is eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, nor shall it be imputed to him; it shall be an abomination unto him who offers it, and the soul who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire. And as for the other flesh, all who are clean shall eat of it.
But the soul who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to Jehovah, while he is unclean, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Moreover the soul who touches any unclean thing, such as human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any abominable unclean thing, and who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering that belongs to Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: You shall not eat any fat, of ox or sheep or goat.
And the fat of an animal that dies naturally, and the fat of what is torn by wild beasts, may be used for any work; but you shall not eat to devour it.
For whoever eats the fat of the animal of which men offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah, the soul who eats it shall be cut off from his people.
Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings, whether of bird or beast.
Whoever eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offering unto Jehovah shall bring his offering unto Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
His own hands shall bring the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. The fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before Jehovah.
And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar with smoke, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons.
Also the right thigh you shall give to the priest as a heave offering from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
He among the sons of Aaron, who offers the blood of the peace offering and the fat, shall have the right thigh for his portion.
For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering I have taken from the children of Israel, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons, from the children of Israel, as a perpetual statute.
This is the portion for the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons, from the offerings by fire unto Jehovah, on the day he presented them to serve Jehovah as priests.
Jehovah commanded this to be given to them by the children of Israel, on the day that he anointed them, as a perpetual statute throughout their generations.
This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the consecrations, and the sacrifice of the peace offerings,
which Jehovah had commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings unto Jehovah in the Wilderness of Sinai.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, the anointing oil, a bull as the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
and gather all the congregation together at the door of the tent of meeting.
And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. And the congregation was gathered together at the door of the tent of meeting.
And Moses said to the congregation, This is what Jehovah has commanded to be done.
And Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
And he put the tunic on him, girded him with the sash, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him; and he girded him with the intricately woven band of the ephod, and with it tied the ephod on him.
And he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate.
And he put the turban on his head. Also on the turban, on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Also Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them.
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the laver and its base, to consecrate them.
And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
And Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put tunics on them, girded them with sashes, and tied the turbans on them, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he brought the bull of the sin offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering,
and Moses killed it. And he took the blood, and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger, and purified the altar. And he poured the blood at the base of the altar, and consecrated it, to make atonement on it.
And he took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses burned them with smoke like incense on the altar.
And the bull, its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he burned with fire outside the camp, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he brought the ram as the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,
and Moses killed it. And he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.
And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat with smoke like incense.
And he washed the entrails and the legs in water. And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar with smoke like incense. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And he brought the second ram, the ram of ordination. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,
and Moses killed it. And he took some of its blood and put it on the tip of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.
And he took the fat and the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe attached to the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;
and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah he took one unleavened cake, a cake of bread anointed with oil, and one wafer, and put them on the fat and on the right thigh;
and he put all these in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands, and waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah.
And Moses took them from their hands and burned them with smoke upon the altar, upon the burnt offering. They were ordination offerings for a soothing aroma; an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Jehovah. It was Moses’ portion of the ram of ordination, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
And Moses said to Aaron and his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of ordination offerings, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
And whatever remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
And you shall not go outside the door of the tent of meeting for seven days, for the days of your ordination to be fulfilled. For seven days he shall confirm your hands.
As he has done this day, thus Jehovah has commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, so that you may not die; for thus I have been commanded.
Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things that Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.
It came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called for Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
And he said to Aaron, Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, that are whole, and offer them before Jehovah.
And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, that are whole, as a burnt offering,
also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today Jehovah will appear unto you.
And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.
And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.
And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah has commanded.
Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar.
But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar with smoke, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented the blood to him, which he sprinkled all around on the altar.
And they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar with smoke.
And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.
And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one.
And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
And he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar with smoke, besides the burnt offering of the morning.
He also killed the bull and the ram as sacrifices of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar,
and the fat from the bull and the ram; the fatty tail, that covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver;
and they put the fat on the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar with smoke.
And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering before Jehovah, as Moses had commanded.
And Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people,
and fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they cried aloud and fell on their faces.
And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.
And fire went out from Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah.
And Moses said to Aaron, This is what Jehovah has spoken, saying: By those who come near Me I will be honored as holy, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron kept still.
And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
So they went near and carried them out of the camp by their tunics, as Moses had spoken.
And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, that you not die, and wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah has kindled.
You shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying:
Do not drink wine or strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, that you not die. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,
to make a distinction between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean,
and to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings by fire unto Jehovah, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is set apart, holy.
You shall eat it in the holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due, of the sacrifices by fire unto Jehovah; for thus I have been commanded.
The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons’ due, which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat by fire, to offer as a wave offering before Jehovah. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a perpetual statute, as Jehovah has commanded.
And Moses investigated to inquire about the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is set apart, holy, and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
Behold, its blood has not been brought inside the holy place; indeed you should have eaten it in the holy place, as I have commanded.
And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and such things have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been accepted in the eyes of Jehovah?
And when Moses heard that, it was good in his eyes.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals which you may eat among all the beasts of the earth:
Among the beasts, whatever divides the hoof, being cloven and split, and bringing up the cud; that you may eat.
Nevertheless these you shall not eat among those that bring up the cud or those that divide the hoof: the camel, because it brings up the cud but does not divide the hoof, is unclean to you;
the hyrax, because it brings up the cud but does not divide the hoof, is unclean to you;
the hare, because it brings up the cud but does not divide the hoof, is unclean to you;
and the swine, though it divides the hoof, being cloven and split, yet does not bring up the cud, is unclean to you.
Their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch. They are unclean to you.
These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever in the water has fins and scales, whether in the seas or in the rivers; that you may eat.
But all in the seas or in the rivers that do not have fins and scales, all that swarm in the water or any living creature which is in the water, they are detestable to you.
They shall be detestable to you; you shall not eat their flesh, but you shall detest their carcasses.
Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales; it shall be detestable to you.
And these you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard,
the kite, and the falcon after its kind;
every raven after its kind,
the ostrich, the owl, the sea gull, and the hawk after its kind;
the little owl, the cormorant, and the great horned owl;
the white owl, the pelican, and the carrion vulture;
the stork, the heron after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat.
All flying creatures that swarm, going upon all fours shall be detestable to you.
Yet these you may eat of every flying creature that swarms, going upon all fours: those which have jointed legs above their feet with which to leap upon the earth.
These you may eat: the swarming locust after its kind, the locust after its kind, the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
But all other flying creatures that swarm, having four feet shall be detestable to you.
By these you shall become unclean; whoever touches the carcass of them shall be unclean until evening;
whoever carries part of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening:
Any beast that divides the hoof, but is not cloven and split and does not bring up the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches it shall be unclean.
And whatever goes on its paws, among all the animals that go on all fours, those are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until evening.
Whoever carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. They are unclean to you.
These also shall be unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind;
the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon.
These are unclean to you among all that swarm. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.
Anything upon which any of them falls when they are dead is unclean, whether it is any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever item it is, in which work is done, it shall be put in water. And it shall be unclean until evening; then it shall be clean.
Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls you shall break; and whatever is in it shall be unclean:
in such a vessel, any edible food upon which water falls shall be unclean, and any drink that may be drunk from it shall be unclean.
And everything on which any part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether it is an oven or cooking stove, it shall be broken down; for they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.
Nevertheless a spring or a cistern, in which there is a collection of water, shall be clean, but whatever touches the carcass shall be unclean.
And if any part of the carcass falls on any planting seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
But if water is put on the seed, and if any part of the carcass has fallen on it, it shall be unclean to you.
And if any beast which is for your food dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening.
He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening. He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening.
And every swarming thing that swarms on the earth shall be detestable. It shall not be eaten.
Whatever goes on its belly, whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet among all swarming things that swarm on the earth; these you shall not eat, for they are detestable.
You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms; nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled by them.
For I am Jehovah your God. You shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy; for I am holy. Neither shall you defile yourselves with any swarming thing that swarms on the earth.
For I am Jehovah who brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
This is the law of the beasts and the flying creatures and every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms on the earth,
to distinguish between the unclean and the clean, and between the animals that may be eaten and the animals that may not be eaten.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a woman has conceived seed, and borne a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days when she is ill with menstruation, she shall be unclean.
And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
She shall then continue in the blood of her menstruation thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled.
But if she bears a female, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her menstruation, and she shall continue in the blood of her menstruation sixty-six days.
When the days of her purification are fulfilled, whether for a son or a daughter, she shall bring to the priest a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering, to the door of the tent of meeting.
And he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her. And she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who has borne a male or a female.
And if she cannot afford to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons; one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
When a man has on the skin of his flesh a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes on the skin of his flesh like a leprous sore, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons the priests.
The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the flesh; and if the hair on the sore has turned white, and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a leprous sore. Then the priest shall examine him, and pronounce him unclean.
And if the bright spot is white on the skin of his flesh, and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest shall shut up the one who has the sore seven days.
And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day; and behold, if the sore appears to be as it was, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall shut him up another seven days.
And the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day; and behold, if the sore has faded, and the sore has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
But if the scab should at all spread over the skin, after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again.
And if the priest sees that, behold, the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
When the leprous sore is on a person, then he shall be brought to the priest.
And the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the swelling on the skin is white, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,
it is an old leprosy on the skin of his flesh. The priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the sore, from his head to his foot, whatever is seen by the priest’s eyes,
then the priest shall consider; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the sore clean. It has all turned white. He is clean.
But in the day raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.
And the priest shall examine the raw flesh and pronounce him unclean; for the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.
Or if the raw flesh returns and has changed to white again, he shall come to the priest.
And the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the sore has returned to white, then the priest shall pronounce the sore clean. He is clean.
If the flesh has a boil in the skin, and it is healed,
and in place of the boil there comes a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be seen by the priest;
and if, when the priest sees it, behold, it appears deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore which has broken out of the boil.
But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;
and if it should spread abroad over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague.
But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Or if the skin of the flesh is burned by fire, and the raw flesh of the burn develops a bright spot, reddish-white or white,
then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair of the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy broken out in the burn. Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore.
But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in the bright spot, and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread abroad over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a leprous sore.
But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread on the skin, but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn. The priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn.
If a man or woman has a sore on the head or in the beard,
then the priest shall examine the sore; and indeed if it appears deeper than the skin, and there is in it thin yellow hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard.
But if the priest examines the scaly sore, and behold, it does not appear deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the one who has the scall seven days.
And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the sore; and behold, if the scall has not spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the scall does not appear deeper than the skin,
he shall shave himself, but the scall he shall not shave. And the priest shall shut up the one who has the scall another seven days.
On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scall; and behold, if the scall has not spread over the skin, and does not appear deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.
But if the scall should spread abroad over the skin after his cleansing,
then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scall has spread over the skin, the priest shall not look for yellow hair. He is unclean.
But if the scall appears to have come to a standstill, and black hair has grown up in it, the scall has healed. He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the flesh, white bright spots,
then the priest shall look; and behold, if the bright spots on the skin of the flesh are dull white, it is a skin spot that grows on the skin. He is clean.
As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head, he is bald, but he is clean.
He whose hair has fallen from his forehead, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean.
And if there is on the bald head or bald forehead a reddish-white sore, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.
And the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the flesh,
he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall pronounce to declare him unclean; his plague is on his head.
And the leper on whom the plague is, his clothes shall be torn and his head bared; and he shall cover his mustache, and call out, Unclean! Unclean!
He shall be unclean. All the days he has the plague he shall be unclean. He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.
And if a garment has a leprous spot in it, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,
whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool, whether in leather or in anything made of leather,
and if the spot is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a leprous spot and shall be shown to the priest.
The priest shall examine the spot and shut up that which has the spot seven days.
And he shall examine the spot on the seventh day. If the spot has spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, in the leather or in anything made of leather, the spot is an active leprosy. It is unclean.
He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague, whether warp or woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, for it is an active leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.
And if the priest examines it, and behold, the spot has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather,
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which is the spot; and he shall shut it up another seven days.
And the priest shall examine the spot after it has been washed; and indeed if the spot has not changed its color, though the spot has not spread, it is unclean, and you shall burn it in the fire; it continues eating away, whether the damage is outside or inside.
If the priest examines it, and behold, the spot has faded after washing it, then he shall tear it out of the garment, whether out of the warp or out of the woof, or out of the leather.
And if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in anything made of leather, it is a spreading plague; you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague.
And if you wash the garment, either warp or woof, or whatever is made of leather, if the spot has gone from it, then it shall be washed a second time, and shall be clean.
This is the law of the leprous plague in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or in anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.
Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest.
And the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the leprosy is healed in the leper,
then the priest shall command to take for him who is being cleansed two living and clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.
And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed on an earthen vessel over running water.
As for the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.
And he shall sprinkle it seven times on him who is being cleansed from the leprosy, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose in the open field.
And he who is being cleansed shall wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean. After that he shall come into the camp, and shall remain outside his tent seven days.
And on the seventh day he shall shave all the hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows; all his hair he shall shave off. He shall wash his clothes and wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs that are whole, one ewe lamb of the first year that is whole, three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and one log of oil.
And the priest who pronounces him clean shall present the man who is being cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer it as a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.
And he shall kill the lamb in the place where he kills the sin offering and the burnt offering, in a holy place; for as the sin offering is the priest’ s, so is the trespass offering. It is set apart, holy.
And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.
And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah.
And of the rest of the oil in his hand, the priest shall put some on the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the blood of the trespass offering.
And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is being cleansed. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.
And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement for him who is being cleansed from his uncleanness. Afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.
And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
But if he is poor and cannot afford it, then he shall take one male lamb as a trespass offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, a log of oil,
and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford: one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.
He shall bring them to the priest on the eighth day for his cleansing, to the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah.
And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah.
And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot.
And the priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his own left hand.
And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah.
And the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed, on the thumb of the right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering.
And the rest of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put on the head of him who is being cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
And he shall offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, such as he can afford;
such as he is able to afford, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, with the grain offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him who is being cleansed before Jehovah.
This is the law for one who had a leprous plague, who cannot afford the usual cleansing.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I have put the leprous plague in a house in the land of your possession,
and he who owns the house comes and informs the priest, saying, There appears to be a plague in the house,
then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes into it to examine the plague, that all that is in the house may not be made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.
And he shall examine the plague; and indeed if the plague is on the walls of the house with ingrained streaks, greenish or reddish, which appear to be deep in the wall,
then the priest shall go out of the house, to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
And the priest shall come again on the seventh day and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which is the plague, and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city.
And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside, all around, and the dust that they scrape off they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.
And they shall take other stones and put them in the place of those stones, and he shall take other mortar and plaster the house.
And if the plague comes back and breaks out in the house, after he has taken away the stones, after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered,
then the priest shall come and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is an active leprosy in the house. It is unclean.
And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber, and all the plaster of the house, and he shall carry them outside the city to an unclean place.
Moreover he who goes into the house at all while it is shut up shall be unclean until evening.
And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes, and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
And if the priest comes in and examines it, and behold, the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
And he shall take, to cleanse the house, two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.
And he shall kill one of the birds on an earthen vessel over running water;
and he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and the running water and the living bird, with the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet.
And he shall let the living bird loose outside the city in the open field, and make atonement for the house, and it shall be clean.
This is the law for any leprous plague and scall,
for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,
for a swelling and a scab and a bright spot,
to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean. This is the law of leprosy.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When any man has a discharge from his flesh, his discharge is unclean.
And this shall be his uncleanness in regard to his discharge; whether his flesh runs with his discharge, or his flesh is stopped up by his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
Every bed on which he who has the discharge lies is unclean, and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.
And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
He who sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
And he who touches the flesh of him who has the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
Any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides shall be unclean.
Whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean until evening. He who carries any of those things shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
And whomever the one who has the discharge touches, and has not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
The vessel of earth that he who has the discharge touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water; then he shall be clean.
On the eighth day he shall take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah, to the door of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest.
And the priest shall offer them, the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah because of his discharge.
And when a man’s semen goes out from him during sexual intercourse, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until evening.
Any garment and any skin on which there is semen shall be washed with water, and be unclean until evening.
And the woman with whom the man lies, when there is semen of sexual intercourse, shall bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
If a woman has a discharge, and the discharge from her flesh is blood, she shall be impure seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.
Everything that she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean; and everything that she sits on shall be unclean.
Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
And whoever touches anything that she sat on shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
If anything is on her bed or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening.
And if a man lies with her to have intercourse, so that her impurity is upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.
If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, other than at the time of her menstruation, or if it flows beyond her usual time of menstruation, all the days of her unclean discharge shall be as the days of her menstruation. She is unclean.
Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge shall be to her as the bed of her menstruation; and whatever she sits on shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her menstruation.
Whoever touches those things shall be unclean; he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening.
But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count for herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
And on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
And the priest shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the discharge of her uncleanness.
Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, lest they die in their uncleanness when they defile My tabernacle that is among them.
This is the law for one who has a discharge, and for him who emits semen and is unclean by it,
and for her who is unwell because of her menstruation, and for one who has a discharge, either man or woman, and for him who lies with her who is unclean.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;
and Jehovah said to Moses: Speak to Aaron your brother that he not come at all times into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark, that he not die; for I will appear in the cloud above the mercy seat.
Thus shall Aaron come into the Holy Place: with the blood of a young bull as a sin offering, and of a ram as a burnt offering.
He shall put the holy linen tunic and the linen trousers on his flesh; he shall be girded with a linen sash, and with the linen turban he shall be wrapped. These are holy garments. Therefore he shall wash his flesh in water, and put them on.
And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats as a sin offering, and one ram as a burnt offering.
And Aaron shall bring near the bull as a sin offering for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.
He shall take the two goats and present them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
And Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for Jehovah and one lot for the scapegoat.
And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the lot of Jehovah fell, and offer it as a sin offering.
And the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before Jehovah, to make atonement with it, and to let it go as the scapegoat into the wilderness.
And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull as the sin offering for himself.
And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from the altar before Jehovah, with his hands full of spiced incense beaten fine, and bring it inside the veil.
And he shall put the incense on the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the Testimony, that he not die.
And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east side; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.
And he shall kill the goat of the sin offering for the people, bring its blood inside the veil, do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat.
Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and thus he shall do for the tent of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
And no man shall be in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out. And he shall make atonement for himself, for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel.
And he shall go out to the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the goat, and put it on the horns of the altar all around.
And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, cleanse it, and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat.
And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is there, ready.
And the goat shall bear upon itself all their iniquities to a separate land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.
And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, shall take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave them there.
And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, put on his garments, come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar with smoke.
And he who released the goat as the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. And they shall burn in the fire their skins, their flesh, and their dung.
And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
This shall be a perpetual statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and do no work, whether a native or a stranger who sojourns among you.
For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you, to cleanse you from all your sins, that you may be clean before Jehovah.
It is a sabbath observance of rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls. It is a perpetual statute.
And the priest, who is anointed and whose hand is confirmed to serve as priest in his father’s place, shall make atonement, and put on the linen clothes, the holy garments;
and he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar, and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
This shall be a perpetual statute for you, to make atonement for the children of Israel, for all their sins, once a year. And he did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded, saying:
Any man of the house of Israel who kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,
and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting to offer an offering unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah, blood shall be imputed to that man. He has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people;
so that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, that they may bring them unto Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings unto Jehovah.
And the priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat with smoke for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
They shall no more offer their sacrifices to goats, after whom they have played the harlot. This shall be a perpetual statute for them throughout their generations.
Also you shall say to them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it unto Jehovah, that man shall be cut off from among his people.
And any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who eats any blood, I will set My face against that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, No one among you shall eat blood, nor shall any stranger who sojourns among you eat blood.
Any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunts and catches any animal or flying creature that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust;
for it is the soul of all flesh. Its blood is its soul. Therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the soul of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.
And every soul who eats what died naturally or what was torn by beasts, whether he is a native or a sojourner, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. Then he shall be clean.
But if he does not wash them nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: I am Jehovah your God.
According to the doings of the land of Egypt, where you have dwelt, you shall not do; and according to the doings of the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you, you shall not do; nor shall you walk in their ordinances.
You shall do My judgments and keep My ordinances, to walk in them: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them: I am Jehovah.
None of you shall approach the flesh of anyone who is kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am Jehovah.
The nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover. She is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
The nakedness of your father’s wife you shall not uncover; it is your father’s nakedness.
The nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother, whether born at home or elsewhere, their nakedness you shall not uncover.
The nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs is your own nakedness.
The nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, begotten by your father; she is your sister; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is near of kin to your father.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is near of kin to your mother.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother: You shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife; you shall not uncover her nakedness.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, nor shall you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are near of kin to her. It is wickedness.
Nor shall you take a woman and her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, while the other is alive.
Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual uncleanness.
Moreover you shall not give seed to your neighbor’s wife through intercourse, to defile yourself with her.
And you shall not give any of your seed to pass through the fire to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God: I am Jehovah.
You shall not lie with a male as with a female. It is an abomination.
Nor shall you mate with any beast, to defile yourself with it. Nor shall any woman stand before a beast to mate with it. It is perversion.
Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have been defiled;
for the land is defiled. Therefore I am visiting its depravity upon it, and the land is vomiting out its inhabitants.
You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native nor any stranger who sojourns among you
(for all these abominations the men who were in the land before you have done, and the land is defiled),
that the land not also vomit you out when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
For whoever does any of these abominations, the persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people.
Therefore you shall keep My charge, so that you do not do any of these abominable customs which were done before you, and that you do not defile yourselves by them: I am Jehovah your God.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them: You shall be holy, for I Jehovah your God am holy.
Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and keep My Sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.
Do not turn to idols, nor make for yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God.
And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto Jehovah, you shall offer it of your own free will.
It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the next day. And if any remains until the third day, it shall be burned with fire.
And if it is eaten to be devoured on the third day, it is unclean; it shall not be accepted.
Therefore anyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy thing of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap the corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.
And you shall not glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall not steal, nor deceive, nor lie to one another.
And you shall not swear by My name for falsehood, nor shall you profane the name of your God: I am Jehovah.
You shall not extort your neighbor, nor rob him. The wages of one who is hired shall not remain with you all night until morning.
You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God: I am Jehovah.
You shall do no injustice in judgment. You shall not be partial to the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty. In righteousness you shall judge your neighbor.
You shall not go about as a talebearer among your people; nor shall you take a stand against the blood of your neighbor: I am Jehovah.
You shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall reprove to correct your neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am Jehovah.
You shall keep My statutes. You shall not breed your livestock with other kinds. You shall not sow your field with mixed seed. Nor shall a garment mixed with linen and wool come upon you.
When a man lies with the seed of intercourse with a woman, who is betrothed to a husband, and who has not been ransomed to be redeemed, nor been given her freedom; there shall be punishment, but they shall not be put to death; because she was not free.
And he shall bring his trespass offering unto Jehovah, to the door of the tent of meeting, a ram as a trespass offering.
The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before Jehovah for his sin which he has sinned. And the sin which he has sinned shall be forgiven him.
When you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall consider their fruit as uncircumcised. Three years it shall be as uncircumcised to you. It shall not be eaten.
But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, for praise unto Jehovah.
And in the fifth year you shall eat its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor shall you practice divination nor fortunetelling.
You shall not shave around the corners of your head, nor shall you spoil the edges of your beard.
You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor put any etched marks on you: I am Jehovah.
Do not defile your daughter, to cause her to be a harlot, that the land not fall into prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.
You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
You shall not turn to mediums nor seek out fortunetellers, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall rise before the gray headed and honor the presence of an old man, and fear your God: I am Jehovah.
And if a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not mistreat him.
The stranger who sojourns among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measurement of size, weight, or measure.
You shall have just scales, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
therefore you shall keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Again, you shall say to the children of Israel: Any of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel, who gives any of his seed to Molech, shall be executed to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
I will set My face against that man, and will cut him off from his people, because he has given his seed to Molech, to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name.
And if the people of the land should conceal to hide their eyes from the man, when he gives his seed to Molech, and they do not kill him,
then I will set My face against that man and against his family; and I will cut him off from his people, along with all who prostitute themselves with him to commit adultery with Molech.
And the soul who turns to mediums and fortunetellers, to commit adultery with them, I will set My face against that soul and cut him off from his people.
Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am Jehovah your God.
And you shall keep My statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifies you.
And each one who curses his father or his mother shall be executed to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.
The man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress, shall be executed to death.
The man who lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall be executed to death. Their blood shall be upon them.
If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be executed to death. They have brought about perversion. Their blood shall be upon them.
If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall be executed to death. Their blood shall be upon them.
If a man marries a woman and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness in your midst.
If a man mates with a beast, he shall be executed to death, and you shall kill the beast.
If a woman approaches any beast and mates with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast. They shall die the death. Their blood is upon them.
If a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, and gives attention to her nakedness and she gives attention to his nakedness, it is shameful. And they shall be cut off in the eyes of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity.
If a man lies with a woman when she is unwell and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister, for that would uncover his near of kin. They shall bear their iniquity.
If a man lies with his aunt, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall be childless.
You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My judgments, and do them, that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.
And you shall not walk in the statutes of the nations which I am casting out before you; for they have done all these things, and therefore I abhor them.
But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Jehovah your God, who has set you apart from the peoples.
You shall therefore distinguish between clean beasts and unclean, between unclean flying creatures and clean, and you shall not make your souls detestable by beast or by flying creature, or by any kind of living thing that moves on the ground, which I have set apart from you as unclean.
And you shall be holy unto Me, for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be Mine.
A man or a woman who is a medium or a fortuneteller shall be executed to death; they shall stone them with stones. Their blood shall be upon them.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them: No one shall be defiled for the dead among his people,
except for his relatives who are nearest to him: his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother;
also his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband, for her he may be defiled.
Otherwise, being a ruler among his people, he shall not be defiled to profane himself.
They shall not make any bald place on their heads, nor shall they shave the corners of their beards nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
They shall be set apart to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Jehovah by fire, and the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.
They shall not take a wife who commits harlotry or a defiled woman, nor shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God.
Therefore you shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.
The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by committing harlotry, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire.
He who is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and who is consecrated to wear the garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes;
nor shall he go near any dead person, nor defile himself for his father or his mother;
nor shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.
And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
A widow or a divorced woman or a defiled woman or a harlot; these he shall not marry; but he shall take a virgin of his own people as wife.
Nor shall he profane his seed among his people, for I Jehovah sanctify him.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron, saying: No man of your seed throughout their generations, who has any blemish, shall approach to offer the bread of his God.
For any man who has a blemish shall not approach: a man blind or lame, mutilated or deformed,
a man who has a broken foot or broken hand,
or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man who has a defect in his eye, or itch or scab, or with crushed testicles.
No man of the seed of Aaron the priest, who has a blemish, shall come near to offer the offerings by fire unto Jehovah. He has a blemish; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.
He may eat the bread of his God, both the set apart, holy, and the holy;
only, he shall not enter the veil nor approach the altar, because he has a blemish; that he not profane My sanctuaries; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.
Thus Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and his sons, that they set themselves apart from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they do not profane My holy name by what they consecrate to Me: I am Jehovah.
Say to them: Anyone of your seed throughout your generations, who goes near the holy things which the children of Israel consecrate unto Jehovah, while he has uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before My face: I am Jehovah.
Any man of the seed of Aaron, who is a leper or has a discharge, shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything made unclean by a corpse, or a man whose seed goes out through intercourse,
or whoever touches any swarming thing by which he is unclean, or any person by whom he is unclean, whatever his uncleanness may be;
the soul who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy things unless he washes his flesh with water.
And when the sun goes down he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat the holy things, because it is his food.
Whatever dies naturally or is torn by beasts he shall not eat, to defile himself with it: I am Jehovah.
They shall therefore keep My ordinance, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby, if they profane it: I, Jehovah, sanctify them.
No stranger shall eat of the holy things; one who sojourns with the priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy things.
But if the priest buys a soul with his money, he may eat it; and one who is born in his house may eat his food.
If the priest’s daughter is married to a man who is a stranger, she shall not eat of the offerings of the holy things.
But if the priest’s daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no child, and has returned to her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat her father’s food; but no stranger shall eat it.
And if a man eats of the holy things unintentionally, then he shall add a fifth part and give it to the priest with the holy thing.
They shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,
nor allow them to bear the iniquity of the guilt offering when they eat the holy things; for I, Jehovah, sanctify them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: Any man of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, who presents his offering for any of his vows or for any of his freewill offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah as a burnt offering;
you shall offer of your own will a male that is whole from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats.
You shall not offer whatever has a blemish, for it shall not be acceptable for you.
And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings unto Jehovah to fulfill his vow, or a freewill offering from the cattle or the sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.
Those that are blind or broken or maimed, or have an ulcer or itch or scabs, you shall not offer unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.
A bull or a lamb that has anything deformed or dwarfed you may offer as a freewill offering, but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
You shall not offer unto Jehovah what is bruised or crushed, or torn or cut; you shall not do it in your land.
Nor from a foreigner’s hand shall you offer any of these as the bread of your God, because their corruption is in them, and blemishes are in them. They shall not be accepted for you.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be with its mother seven days; and from the eighth day and onward it shall be acceptable as an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
However, with the cow or ewe, do not kill both her and her young on the same day.
And when you offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, offer it of your own will.
On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until morning: I am Jehovah.
Therefore you shall keep My commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be treated holy among the children of Israel. I am Jehovah who sanctifies you,
who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: The set feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, these are My appointed times:
Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath observance of rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work; it is the Sabbath of Jehovah in all your dwellings.
These are the set feasts of Jehovah, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons:
On the fourteenth day of the first month at evening is the Passover unto Jehovah.
And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread unto Jehovah; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall do no labor of work.
And you shall offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah for seven days; and the seventh day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no labor of work.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest;
he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you; on the day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
And you shall offer on that day, when you wave the sheaf, a male lamb of the first year, that is whole, as a burnt offering unto Jehovah.
Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, for a soothing aroma; and its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin of wine.
You shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor fruit until the same day that you have brought an offering unto your God; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
And when you have counted for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath, the day that you bring the sheaf of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths shall be completed.
Count fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath; and you shall offer a new grain offering unto Jehovah.
You shall bring from your dwellings two wave loaves of two-tenths of an ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven. They are the firstfruits unto Jehovah.
And you shall offer with the bread, seven lambs of the first year that are whole, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering unto Jehovah, with their grain offering and their drink offerings, an offering by fire for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And you shall sacrifice one kid of the goats as a sin offering, and two male lambs of the first year as a sacrifice of peace offerings.
The priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits as a wave offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs. They shall be holy unto Jehovah for the priest.
And you shall make a proclamation on the same day: it is a holy convocation to you. You shall do no labor of work. It shall be a perpetual statute in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely reap to the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning from your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a Sabbath observance, a memorial of shouting with trumpet blasts, a holy convocation.
You shall do no labor of work; and you shall offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be a Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and bring an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is a Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
For any soul that is not afflicted on that same day shall be cut off from his people.
And any soul who does any work on that same day, that soul I will destroy from among his people.
You shall do no work; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
It shall be to you a Sabbath observance of rest, and you shall afflict your souls; on the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall observe your sabbath.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Booths for seven days unto Jehovah.
On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.
For seven days you shall offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah. It is a solemn assembly, and you shall do no labor of work.
These are the set feasts of Jehovah which you shall proclaim: holy convocations, to offer an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt offering and a grain offering, a sacrifice and drink offerings, every matter for the day on its day;
besides the Sabbaths of Jehovah, besides your gifts, besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings which you give unto Jehovah.
Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah for seven days; on the first day there shall be a Sabbath observance, and on the eighth day a Sabbath observance.
And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God for seven days.
You shall hold it as a feast unto Jehovah for seven days in the year. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. You shall hold it in the seventh month.
You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are natives of Israel shall dwell in booths,
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Thus Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Command the children of Israel that they bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps burn continually.
Outside the veil of the Testimony, in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall arrange it from evening until morning before Jehovah continually; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
He shall arrange the lamps on the pure lampstand before Jehovah continually.
And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.
You shall set them in two rows, six to a row, on the pure table before Jehovah.
And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually, from the children of Israel for a perpetual covenant.
And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in the holy place; for it is set apart, holy, to him from the offerings of Jehovah by fire, by a perpetual statute.
Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel struggled together in the camp.
And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed; and so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
And they put him in confinement, that the mouth of Jehovah might be declared to them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Take him who has cursed outside the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.
And whoever blasphemes the name of Jehovah shall be executed to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones, the sojourner as well as him who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the Name, he shall be put to death.
Any one who strikes the soul of a man shall be executed to death.
Whoever strikes the soul of a beast shall make good; soul for soul.
If a man causes a blemish to his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him;
break for break, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has given a blemish to a man, so shall it be done to him.
And whoever kills a beast shall make compensation; but whoever kills a man shall be put to death.
You shall have the same law for the sojourner and for the native; for I am Jehovah your God.
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they took him who had cursed outside the camp, and stoned him with stones. Thus the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land which I am giving you, then the land shall keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.
Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and gather its produce;
but in the seventh year there shall be a rest of Sabbath observance for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah. You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard.
What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine, for it is a year of rest for the land.
And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you: for you, your male and female servants, your hired man, and the stranger who sojourns with you,
for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land; all its produce shall be for food.
And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years; and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty-nine years.
Then you shall cause the shofar of jubilation to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make the shofar to pass throughout all your land.
And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.
The fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you; in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine.
For it is the Jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat its produce from the field.
In the Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession.
And if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand, you shall not oppress one another.
According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor, and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you.
According to the multitude of years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price; for he sells to you according to the number of the crops.
Therefore you shall not oppress one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Jehovah your God.
Thus you shall do My statutes and keep My judgments, and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.
And the land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell there in safety.
And if you say, What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?
Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall produce crops enough for three years.
And you shall sow in the eighth year, and eat old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat of the old harvest.
The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is Mine; for you are strangers and sojourners with Me.
And in all the land of your possession you shall grant redemption of the land.
If one of your brethren becomes poor, and has sold some of his possession, and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it, then he may redeem what his brother sold.
Or if the man has no one to redeem it, but he himself becomes able to redeem it,
then let him count the years since its sale, and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it, that he may return to his possession.
But if he is not able to have it restored to himself, then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the Year of Jubilee; and in the Jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
If a man sells a house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year he may redeem it.
But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house in the walled city shall be confirmed permanently to him who bought it, throughout his generations. It shall not go out in the Jubilee.
However the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be considered as the fields of the land. They may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee.
Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, and the houses in the cities of their possession, the Levites always have the right of redemption.
And if a man redeems a house from the Levites, then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out in the Jubilee; for the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
But the field of the common land of their cities shall not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
If one of your brethren becomes poor, and his hand has become shaky, then you shall support him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you.
Take no usury or interest from him; but fear your God, that your brother may live with you.
You shall not give him your money at interest, nor give him your food at a profit.
I am Jehovah your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor, and has sold himself to you, you shall not compel him to serve as a slave.
As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you, and shall serve you until the Year of Jubilee.
And then he shall depart from you; he and his children with him; and shall return to his own family. He shall return to the possession of his fathers.
For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.
You shall not rule over him with harshness, but you shall fear your God.
And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have from the nations that are around you, from them you shall buy male and female slaves.
Moreover you shall buy the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, and their families who are with you, which they beget in your land; and they shall be your property.
And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them as a possession; they shall be your permanent slaves. But regarding your brethren, the children of Israel, you shall not rule over one another with harshness.
Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich, and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor, and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you, or to a member of the stranger’s family,
after he is sold he may be redeemed again. One of his brothers may redeem him;
or his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him; or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him; or if he is able he may redeem himself.
Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him: The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Jubilee; it shall be according to the time of a hired servant for him.
If there are still many years remaining, according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought.
And if there remain but a few years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall reckon with him, and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption.
He shall be with him year by year as a hired servant, and he shall not rule with harshness over him before your eyes.
And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the Year of Jubilee; he and his children with him.
For the children of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
You shall not make idols for yourselves; neither a carved image nor a sacred pillar shall you rear up for yourselves; nor shall you set up an image of stone in your land, to bow down to it; for I am Jehovah your God.
You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments, and do them,
then I will give you rain in its season, the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one shall make you afraid; I will rid the land of evil beasts, and the sword shall not go through your land.
You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall by the sword before you.
Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; your enemies shall fall by the sword before you.
For I will look on you favorably and make you fruitful, multiply you and establish My covenant with you.
You shall eat the old harvest, and clear out the old because of the new.
I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you.
I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people.
I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you walk upright.
But if you do not obey Me, and do not do all these commandments,
and if you despise My statutes, or if your soul abhors My judgments, so that you do not do all My commandments, but break My covenant,
I also will do this to you: I will even appoint terror over you, wasting disease and fever which shall consume the eyes and cause pining away of soul. And you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
I will set My face against you, and you shall be smitten by your enemies. Those who hate you shall reign over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you.
And after all this, if you do not obey Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
I will break the pride of your power; I will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze.
And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its produce, nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
And if you walk contrary to Me, and are not willing to obey Me, I will bring upon you seven times more plagues, according to your sins.
I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number; and your highways shall be desolate.
And if by these things you do not let yourselves be corrected by Me, but walk contrary to Me,
then I also will walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
And I will bring a sword against you that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; when you are gathered together within your cities I will send pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
And when I have cut off your supply of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall bring back your bread by weight, and you shall eat and not be satisfied.
And after all this, if you do not obey Me, but walk contrary to Me,
then I also will walk contrary to you in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.
And I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you.
And I will lay your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell your soothing aromas.
I will bring the land to desolation, and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
I will scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you; your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.
Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in the land of your enemies; then the land shall rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest on your sabbaths when you dwelt in it.
And as for those of you who are left, I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a driven leaf shall cause them to flee; they shall flee as though fleeing from a sword, and they shall fall when no one is pursuing.
They shall stumble over one another, as it were before a sword, when no one is pursuing; and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.
And those of you who are left shall rot away in their iniquity in the lands of their enemies; also in their fathers’ iniquities, which are with them, they shall rot away.
But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, with their unfaithfulness in which they were unfaithful to Me, and that they also have walked contrary to Me,
and that I also have walked contrary to them and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if their uncircumcised hearts are humbled, and they accept their guilt;
then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with Abraham I will remember; and I will remember the land.
The land also shall be forsaken by them, and shall be satisfied with its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; they shall accept their guilt, because they had despised My judgments and because their soul had abhorred My statutes.
Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor shall I abhor them, to utterly destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.
But for their sake I will remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.
These are the statutes and judgments and laws which Jehovah has set between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man makes an extraordinary vow of his soul unto Jehovah by valuation,
if your valuation is of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels;
and if from five years old up to twenty years old, then your valuation for a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels;
and if from a month old up to five years old, then your valuation for a male shall be five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver;
and if from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.
But if he is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall set a value for him; according to what he who vowed is able to afford, the priest shall value him.
If it is an animal that men may bring as an offering unto Jehovah, all that anyone gives unto Jehovah shall be holy.
He shall not substitute it nor exchange it, good for bad or bad for good; and if he at all exchanges beast for beast, then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy.
If it is an unclean beast which they do not offer as an offering unto Jehovah, then he shall present the beast before the priest;
and the priest shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.
But if he pays to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth to your valuation.
And when a man consecrates his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall set a value for it, whether it is good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand.
If he who consecrated it will redeem his house, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
If a man consecrates unto Jehovah part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
If he consecrates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.
But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money due according to the years that remain till the Year of Jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.
And if he who consecrates the field will pay to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be confirmed to him.
But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore;
but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a devoted field; it shall be the possession of the priest.
And if a man consecrates unto Jehovah a field which he has bought, which is not the field of his possession,
then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation, up to the Year of Jubilee, and he shall give your valuation on that day as a holy offering unto Jehovah.
In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to the one who owns the land as a possession.
And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the shekel.
But the firstborn of the beasts, which is the firstborn unto Jehovah, no man shall consecrate; whether ox or sheep: it is already Jehovah’s.
And if it is an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to your valuation, and shall add one-fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
Nevertheless no devoted thing that a man may devote unto Jehovah of all that he has, both man and beast, or the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is set apart, holy, unto Jehovah.
No devoted thing, devoted for destruction by men, shall be redeemed, but shall die the death.
And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah’s. It is holy unto Jehovah.
If a man will pay to redeem any of his tithes, he shall add one-fifth to it.
And concerning the tithe of the herd or the flock, of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth one shall be holy unto Jehovah.
He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it; and if he makes a change to exchange it, then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
Take a head count of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, every male by head,
from twenty years old and above; all who are able to go to war in Israel. You and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each one the head of his father’s house.
These are the names of the men who shall stand with you: from Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
from Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
from Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
from Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar;
from Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;
from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
from Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni;
from Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
from Asher, Pagiel the son of Ocran;
from Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel;
from Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan.
These were chosen from the congregation, leaders of their fathers’ tribes, heads of thousands in Israel.
And Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name,
and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their lineage by families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, each one by head.
As Jehovah commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
And the sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, every male by head, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Reuben were forty-six thousand five hundred.
From the sons of Simeon, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, of those who were numbered, according to the number of names, every male by head, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Simeon were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
From the sons of Gad, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Gad were forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
From the sons of Judah, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Judah were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
From the sons of Issachar, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Issachar were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
From the sons of Zebulun, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Zebulun were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
From the sons of Joseph, the sons of Ephraim, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Ephraim were forty thousand five hundred.
From the sons of Manasseh, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Manasseh were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
From the sons of Benjamin, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Benjamin were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
From the sons of Dan, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Dan were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
From the sons of Asher, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Asher were forty-one thousand five hundred.
From the sons of Naphtali, their genealogies by their families, by their fathers’ house, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war:
those who were numbered of the tribe of Naphtali were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
These are the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each one representing his father’s house.
So all who were numbered of the sons of Israel, by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and above, all who were able to go to war in Israel;
all who were numbered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe;
for Jehovah had spoken to Moses, saying:
Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor take a head count of them among the sons of Israel;
but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, over all its furnishings, and over all things that belong to it; they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they shall serve for it and camp around the tabernacle.
And when the tabernacle sets out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, everyone by his own camp, everyone by his own standard, according to their armies;
but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.
Thus the children of Israel did; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, thus they did.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Everyone of the sons of Israel shall encamp by his own standard, next to the emblems of his father’s house; they shall encamp at a distance from the tent of meeting.
On the east side, toward the rising of the sun, those of the standard of the camp of Judah shall encamp according to their hosts; and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be the captain of the sons of Judah:
and his army was numbered at seventy-four thousand six hundred.
Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar; and Nethanel the son of Zuar shall be the captain of the sons of Issachar:
and his army was numbered at fifty-four thousand four hundred.
Then, the tribe of Zebulun; and Eliab the son of Helon shall be the captain of the sons of Zebulun:
and his army was numbered at fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
All who were numbered according to their hosts with the camp of Judah, one hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred: these shall set out first.
On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts; and the captain of the sons of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur:
and his army was numbered at forty-six thousand five hundred.
Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon; and the captain of the sons of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai:
and his army was numbered at fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
Then, the tribe of Gad; and the captain of sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel:
and his army was numbered at forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
All who were numbered according to their hosts of the camp of Reuben, one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty: they shall set out second.
And the tent of meeting shall set out with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps. As they encamp, so they shall set out, everyone in his place, by their standards.
On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts; and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud:
and his army was numbered at forty thousand five hundred.
Next to him, the tribe of Manasseh; and the captain of the sons of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur:
and his army was numbered at thirty-two thousand two hundred.
Then, the tribe of Benjamin; and the captain of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni:
and his army was numbered at thirty-five thousand four hundred.
All who were numbered according to their hosts of the camp of Ephraim, one hundred and eight thousand one hundred: they shall set out third.
The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side according to their hosts; and the captain of the sons of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai:
and his army was numbered at sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher; and the captain of the sons of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran:
and his army was numbered at forty-one thousand five hundred.
Then, the tribe of Naphtali; and the captain of the sons of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan:
and his army was numbered at fifty-three thousand four hundred.
All who were numbered of the camp of Dan, one hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred: they shall set out last, with their standards.
These are the ones who were numbered of the sons of Israel by their fathers’ houses. All who were numbered according to their hosts of the camps were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
But the Levites were not numbered among the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And the sons of Israel did according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses: Thus they encamped by their standards and thus they set out, each one with his family, according to their fathers’ houses.
Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab, the firstborn; and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whom he consecrated to serve as priests.
Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered strange fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may serve him.
And they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.
And they shall have charge of all the utensils of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are assigned to him from among the sons of Israel.
Thus you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall have charge of the priesthood; but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
And behold, I Myself have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the sons of Israel. Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,
because all the firstborn are Mine. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself every firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine: I am Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying:
Number the sons of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families; you shall number every male from a month old and above.
So Moses numbered them at the mouth of Jehovah, as he had been commanded.
And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.
And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
And the sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These, the families of the Levites by their fathers’ houses.
From Gershon came the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimites; these were the families of the Gershonites.
Those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above; of those who were numbered there were seven thousand five hundred.
The families of the Gershonites were to encamp behind the tabernacle westward.
And the leader of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
The charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was the tabernacle, the tent with its covering, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
the screen for the door of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and the altar, and their cords, according to all their work.
From Kohath came the family of the Amramites, the family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.
The number of all the males, from a month old and above, were eight thousand six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.
The families of the sons of Kohath were to encamp on the south side of the tabernacle.
And the leader of the fathers’ house of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
Their charge was the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, the veil, and all their service.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest was chief over the leaders of the Levites, with oversight of those who kept charge of the sanctuary.
From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family of the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.
And those who were numbered, according to the number of all the males from a month old and above, were six thousand two hundred.
The leader of the fathers’ house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. These were to encamp on the north side of the tabernacle.
And the oversight and charge of the sons of Merari was the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, its utensils, all their service,
and the pillars of the court all around, with their sockets, their pegs, and their cords.
And those who were to encamp before the tabernacle on the east, before the tent of meeting, were Moses, Aaron, and his sons, keeping charge of the sanctuary, to keep the charge of the children of Israel. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and above, were twenty-two thousand.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and above, and take the number of their names.
And you shall take the Levites for Me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the children of Israel.
So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded him.
And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names from a month old and above, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. The Levites are Mine: I am Jehovah.
And for the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the sons of Israel, who are more than the Levites,
you shall take five shekels per head; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel of twenty gerahs.
And you shall give the money, with which the excess number of them is redeemed, to Aaron and his sons.
So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those who were redeemed by the Levites.
From the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
And Moses gave their redemption money to Aaron and his sons, at the mouth of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Take a head count of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ house,
from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the tent of meeting.
This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, regarding the set apart, holy things:
When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall come, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.
And they shall put on it a covering of badger skins, and spread over that a cloth entirely of violet; and they shall insert its poles.
On the table of the Bread of the Presence they shall spread a violet cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the jars for pouring; and the continual bread shall be on it.
They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.
And they shall take a violet cloth and cover the lampstand of the light, with its lamps, its snuffers, its trays, and all its oil vessels, with which they serve it.
And they shall put it with all its utensils into a covering of badger skins, and put it on a bar.
Over the golden altar they shall spread a violet cloth, and cover it with a covering of badger skins; and they shall insert its poles.
And they shall take all the utensils of service with which they minister in the sanctuary, put them in a violet cloth, cover them with a covering of badger skins, and put them on a bar.
And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.
They shall put on it all its implements with which they minister there; the firepans, the forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread on it a covering of badger skins, and insert its poles.
And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp sets out then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. These are the burdens of the tent of meeting for the sons of Kohath.
The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light, the spiced incense, the continual grain offering, the anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle, of all that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites;
but do this to them, that they may live and not die when they approach the set apart, holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint each man to his service and his burden.
But they shall not go in to watch while the holy things are being covered, that they not die.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Also take a head count of the sons of Gershon, by their fathers’ house, by their families.
From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall number them, all who enter to perform the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and the burdens:
They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the tent of meeting with its covering, the covering of badger skins that is on it, the screen for the door of the tent of meeting,
the screen for the door of the gate of the court, the hangings of the court which are around the tabernacle and altar, and their cords, all the furnishings for their service and all that is made for these things: thus shall they serve.
At the mouth of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all their burdens and all their service. And you shall assign to them the charge of their burdens.
This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting. And their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families and by their fathers’ house.
From thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, you shall assign them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the tent of meeting.
And this is the charge of their burden according to all their service for the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
and the pillars around the court with their sockets, pegs, and cords, with all their furnishings and all their service; and you shall assign to each man by name the utensils of the charge of his burden.
This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service for the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
And Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers’ house,
from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting;
and those who were numbered by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
These were those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who might serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families and by their fathers’ house,
from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting;
those who were numbered by their families, by their fathers’ house, were two thousand six hundred and thirty.
These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all who might serve in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah.
And those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers’ house,
from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for the work in the tent of meeting;
those who were numbered by their families were three thousand two hundred.
These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers’ house,
from thirty years old and above, even to fifty years old, everyone who came to do the work of service and the work of the burdens in the tent of meeting;
those who were numbered were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
At the mouth of Jehovah they were numbered by the hand of Moses, each man according to his service and according to his burden; thus were they numbered by him, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and everyone who is unclean because of the dead.
You shall send out both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp, that they not defile their camps in the midst of which I dwell.
And the children of Israel did so, and sent them outside the camp; as Jehovah had spoken to Moses, so the children of Israel did.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel: When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit in unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and that soul is guilty,
then they shall confess the sin which they have done. He shall make restitution for his trespass in full, add a fifth to it, and give it to the one he has wronged.
But if the man has no relative to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution for the wrong shall go to Jehovah for the priest, besides the ram of the atonement with which atonement is made for him.
Every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.
And every man’s holy things shall be his; whatever any man gives to the priest shall be his.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: If any man’s wife turns aside and transgresses in unfaithfulness toward him,
and a man has lain with her with the seed of intercourse, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and it is concealed that she has been defiled, and there was no witness against her, nor has she been caught;
if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, who has been defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him and he becomes jealous of his wife, although she has not been defiled;
then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. He shall bring the offering for her, one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it, because it is a grain offering of jealousy, an offering for remembering, for bringing iniquity to remembrance.
And the priest shall bring her near, and make her stand before Jehovah.
The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.
And the priest shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering for remembering in her hands, which is the grain offering of jealousy. And in the priest’s hand shall be the bitter water that brings a curse.
And the priest shall charge her under oath, and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness while under your husband, be free from this bitter water that brings a curse.
But if you have turned aside while under your husband, and if you have been defiled and some man besides your husband has lain with you;
then the priest shall charge the woman under the oath of the curse, and he shall say to the woman: Jehovah make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh waste away and your belly swell;
and this water that causes the curse shall go into your stomach, and make your belly swell and your thigh waste away. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them off into the bitter water.
And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her to become bitter.
And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the woman’s hand, shall wave the offering before Jehovah, and bring it to the altar;
and the priest shall take a handful of the offering, as its memorial portion, burn it on the altar with smoke, and afterward make the woman drink the water.
When he has made her drink the water, then it shall be, if she has been defiled and transgressed in unfaithfulness toward her husband, that the water that brings a curse shall enter into her and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, her thigh shall waste away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
But if the woman has not been defiled, and is pure, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.
This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, while under her husband, turns aside and has been defiled;
or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he becomes jealous of his wife; then he shall make the woman stand before Jehovah, and the priest shall pass all this law upon her.
And the man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman shall bear her iniquity.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When either a man or woman makes an extraordinary vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself unto Jehovah,
he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink neither vinegar made from wine nor vinegar made from strong drink; neither shall he drink any grape juice, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.
All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced from the grapevine, from seed to skin.
All the days of the vow of his separation no razor shall pass over his head; until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself unto Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall allow the locks of the hair of his head to grow.
All the days that he separates himself unto Jehovah he shall not go near a dead person.
He shall not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, for his brother or his sister, at their death, because his consecration unto God is upon his head.
All the days of his separation he shall be holy unto Jehovah.
And if in dying anyone dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it.
And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting;
and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he has sinned regarding the dead person; and he shall consecrate his head that same day.
He shall dedicate unto Jehovah the days of his separation, and bring a male lamb of the first year as a trespass offering; and the former days are lost, because his separation was defiled.
And this is the law of the Nazirite: When the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the tent of meeting.
And he shall present his offering unto Jehovah: one male lamb of the first year that is whole as a burnt offering, one ewe lamb of the first year that is whole as a sin offering, one ram that is whole as a peace offering,
a basket of unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their grain offering with their drink offerings.
And the priest shall bring them before Jehovah and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering;
and he shall offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings unto Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened cakes; the priest shall also offer its grain offering and its drink offering.
And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his consecrated hair,
and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before Jehovah; they are holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering. Afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.
This is the law of the Nazirite who vows unto Jehovah the offering for his separation, and besides that, whatever his hand is able to afford; according to the vow which he vows, thus he shall do according to the law of his separation.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, In this manner you shall bless the children of Israel. Say unto them:
Jehovah bless you and keep you;
Jehovah make His face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you;
Jehovah lift up His presence upon you, and give you peace.
Thus they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.
And it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and the altar and all its utensils; thus he anointed them and consecrated them.
And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, who were the leaders of the tribes and over those who were numbered, brought offerings.
And they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for every two of the leaders, and for each one an ox; and they presented them before the tabernacle.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Receive it from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the tent of meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
So Moses took the carts and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;
and four carts and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because theirs was the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders.
And the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar on the day it was anointed; thus the leaders offered their offering before the altar.
For Jehovah said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.

And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim; thus He spoke to him.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to Aaron, and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.
And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And the workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it was hammered work. According to the pattern which Jehovah had shown Moses, so he had made the lampstand.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them.
Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of sin offering on them, and they shall pass a razor over all their flesh and wash their clothes, and thus purify themselves.
And let them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering.
And you shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel.
And you shall bring the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites;
and Aaron shall wave the Levites before Jehovah, as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of Jehovah.
And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering unto Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.
And you shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and offer them as a wave offering unto Jehovah.
Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.
Afterward the Levites shall go in to serve the tent of meeting. Thus you shall cleanse them and wave them, a wave offering.
For they are wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel.
For every firstborn among the sons of Israel is Mine, both man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them to Myself.
I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel.
And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to serve in the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, that there be no plague among the children of Israel by the children of Israel coming near the sanctuary.
Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus the sons of Israel did to them.
And the Levites were purified and washed their clothes; and Aaron waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
Afterward the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, thus they did to them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
This is what applies to the Levites: From twenty-five years old and above one shall enter to go forth to serve in the service of the tent of meeting;
and at the age of fifty years they shall return from going forth to this service, and shall serve no more.
They shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, but they shall not serve in any service. Thus you shall do to the Levites concerning their charge.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
Let the children of Israel observe the Passover at its appointed time.
On the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, you shall observe it at its appointed time. According to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall observe it.
So Moses spoke to the children of Israel to observe the Passover.
And they observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, thus the children of Israel did.
Now there were certain men who were defiled by a dead man, so that they could not observe the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron that day.
And those men said to him, We are defiled by a dead man. Why are we kept from offering the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?
And Moses said to them, Stand by, that I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: If anyone of you or your generations is unclean because of a dead person, or is far away on a journey, he shall still observe the Passover unto Jehovah.
On the fourteenth day of the second month, at evening, they shall observe it. They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall observe it.
But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, and has ceased to observe the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he did not bring the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
And if a stranger sojourns among you, and would keep the Passover unto Jehovah, he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance; you shall have one ordinance, both for the sojourner and the native of the land.
And on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire.
Thus it was always: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tent, after that the children of Israel would set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would encamp.
At the mouth of Jehovah the children of Israel would set out, and at the mouth of Jehovah they would encamp; for as many days as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped.
When the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.
So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a number of days: according to the mouth of Jehovah they would remain encamped, and according to the mouth of Jehovah they would set out.
So it was, when the cloud remained from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would set out; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would set out.
Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel would remain encamped and not set out; but when it was taken up, they would set out.
At the mouth of Jehovah they remained encamped, and at the mouth of Jehovah they set out; they kept the charge of Jehovah, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Make two silver trumpets for yourself; you shall make them of hammered work. They shall be for assembling the congregation and for the setting out of the camps.
When they blow with them, all the congregation shall gather before you at the door of the tent of meeting.
And if they blow with one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather to you.
When you sound the alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall then set out.
When you sound the alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall set out; they shall sound the alarm for them to set out.
And when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but not sound the alarm.
The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be to you as a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations.
And when you go to war in your land against the enemy who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, and you will be remembered before Jehovah your God, and you shall be delivered from your enemies.
Also in the day of your gladness, at your appointed times, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
Now it came to pass on the twentieth of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.
And the children of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sinai on their journeys; and the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.
Thus they first set out at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their armies; over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out, carrying the tabernacle.
And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their armies; over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
And the Kohathites set out, carrying the sanctuary. (The tabernacle had been prepared for them to come.)
And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their armies; over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan (the rear guard of all the camps) set out according to their armies; over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they set out.
And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, We are setting out for the place of which Jehovah has said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Jehovah has promised good to Israel.
And he said to him, I will not go, but I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.
And he said, Please do not leave, inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.
And it shall be, if you go with us; indeed it shall be; that whatever good Jehovah will do to us, the same we shall do to you.
So they departed from the mountain of Jehovah on a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah set out before them for the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.
And the cloud of Jehovah was above them by day when they set out from the camp.
Thus it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said: Rise up, O Jehovah! Let Your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate You flee before You.
And when it rested, he said: Return, O Jehovah, to the multitudes of the thousands of Israel.
Now the people murmured, and it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; for Jehovah heard it, and His anger burned. And the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed those in the outskirts of the camp.
And the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses made intercession unto Jehovah, the fire was quenched.
And he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.
And the mixed multitude who were among them lusted after their lusts; and the children of Israel turned back and wept, saying: Who will give us flesh to eat?
We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;
but now our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!
Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.
The people went about and gathered it, ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of juicy oil.
And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna fell on it.
And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah burned greatly; and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.
And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your eyes, to lay the burden of all these people on me?
Have I conceived all these people? Have I begotten them, that You say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a supporting father carries a nursing child, to the land which You have sworn to their fathers?
Where would I get flesh to set before all these people? For they weep upon me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
I am not able to bear all these people alone, because they are too heavy for me.
If You are dealing with me like this, please kill and destroy me, if I have found favor in Your eyes; and do not let me see my distress!
And Jehovah said to Moses: Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be elders of the people and officers over them; bring them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with you.
And I will come down and speak with you there. And I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will lay upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.
And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and you shall eat.
You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,
but to a month of days, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why have we come up out of Egypt?
And Moses said, The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand footmen; yet You have said, I will give them flesh, and they shall eat for a month of days.
Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide for them?
And Jehovah said to Moses, Is the hand of Jehovah shortened? Now you shall see whether My word shall come to pass unto you or not.
And Moses went out and spoke unto the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.
And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and laid upon the seventy men of the elders; and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they did not do so again.
But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they were among those enrolled, but had not gone out to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
And Joshua the son of Nun, minister to Moses, a youth, answered and said, Moses my lord, stop them!
And Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh, that all the people of Jehovah were prophets and that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!
And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
And a wind went forth from Jehovah, and it brought quail from the sea and left them near the camp, about a day’s journey here and about a day’s journey there, all around the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground.
And the people arose all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten homers); and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
And while the flesh was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah burned against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very great plague.
And he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.
And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.
And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also? And Jehovah heard it.
(Now the man Moses was very meek, more than any man on the face of the earth.)
And Jehovah suddenly said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting! And the three came out.
And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam; and they both went forward.
And He said, Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, Jehovah, reveal Myself to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream.
Not so with My servant Moses! He is faithful in all My house.
I speak with him mouth to mouth, even by appearance, and not in riddles; and he looks upon the form of Jehovah. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?
And the anger of Jehovah burned against them, and He departed.
And when the cloud departed from above the tent, behold Miriam was leprous as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she had leprosy.
And Aaron said to Moses, Oh my lord I beseech you! Do not lay this sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.
I beseech you, do not let her be as one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb!
And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, Please heal her, O Mighty God, I pray!
And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had but spat in her face, would she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days, and afterward she shall be brought in.
And Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days, and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in.
And afterward the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.
And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran at the mouth of Jehovah, all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.
Now these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
from the tribe of Joseph, that is, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way into the south, and go up into the mountains,
and see what the land is: whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;
whether the land they dwell in is good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;
whether the land is fat or lean; and whether there are forests there or not. Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.
And they went up through the South and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, those born to Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.
The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down there.
And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
And they departed and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
And they reported to him and said: We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong; the cities are fortified and very great; moreover we saw those born of Anak there.
The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and beside the Jordan.
And Caleb silenced the people before Moses, and said, Let us arise to go up and take possession, for we are able to prevail.
But the men who had gone up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.
And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, The land through which we have gone as spies is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature.
There we saw the giants, the sons of Anak of the giants; and we were like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and so we were in their eyes.
And all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people wept that night.
And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or that only we had died in this wilderness!
Why is Jehovah bringing us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and children should become prey? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?
So they said to one another, Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, among those who spied out the land, tore their clothes;
and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: The land we passed through to spy out is an exceedingly good land.
If Jehovah has delighted in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us; a land flowing with milk and honey.
Only do not rebel against Jehovah, nor fear the people of the land, for they are our bread; their shade has departed from them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.
And all the congregation intended to stone them with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting before all the children of Israel.
And Jehovah said to Moses: How long will these people reject Me? And how long will they not believe Me, with all the signs which I have done among them?
I will strike them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.
And Moses said to Jehovah: Then the Egyptians will hear it (for by Your might You brought these people up from among them),
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, Jehovah, are among these people; that You, Jehovah, are seen face to face and Your cloud stands above them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.
Now if You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying,
Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.
And now, I beseech You, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,
Jehovah is longsuffering and abundant in mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but not acquitting to leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generation.
Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, according to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have borne this people, from Egypt even until now.
And Jehovah said: I have pardoned, according to your word;
but truly, as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah;
because all these men seeing My glory and the signs which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness, and tested Me now these ten times, and have not heeded My voice,
they shall not see the land of which I have sworn to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it.
But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his seed shall possess it.
(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
How long shall I bear with this evil congregation who complain against Me? I have heard the murmurings which the children of Israel grumble against Me.
Say to them, As I live, says Jehovah, just as you have spoken in My ears, so I will do to you:
The carcasses of you who have grumbled against Me shall fall in this wilderness, all of you who were numbered, according to your entire number, from twenty years old and above.
Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, you shall by no means enter the land which I raised My hand and swore to make you dwell there.
But your little ones, whom you said would be prey, I will bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.
But as for you, your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness.
And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and bear your harlotry, until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness.
According to the number of the days in which you spied out the land, forty days, for each day you shall bear your iniquities one year; forty years; and you shall know My opposition.
I Jehovah have spoken: I will surely do so to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation grumble against him by bringing an evil report of the land,
those very men who brought the evil report about the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.
But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive, of the men who went to spy out the land.
And Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
And they arose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, Here we are, and we will go up to the place which Jehovah has promised; for we have sinned.
And Moses said, Why do you transgress the mouth of Jehovah? For it will not prosper.
Do not go up, that you not be smitten before your enemies, for Jehovah is not among you.
For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword, because you have turned away from Jehovah; Jehovah is not with you.
But they heedlessly went up to the top of the mountain; nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of Jehovah nor Moses departed from the camp.
And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt in that mountain came down and struck them, and beat them to pieces, to Hormah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you have come into the land you are to inhabit, which I am giving to you,
and you make an offering by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in your appointed times, to make a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, from the herd or the flock,
then he who presents his offering unto Jehovah shall bring a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil;
and one-fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.
Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
and as a drink offering you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to separate a vow, or as a peace offering unto Jehovah,
then shall be offered with the young bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil;
and you shall bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
Thus it shall be done for each young bull, for each ram, or for each lamb or young goat.
According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do with everyone according to their number.
All who are natives shall do these things in this manner, in presenting an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And if a stranger sojourns with you, or whoever is among you throughout your generations, and would present an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, just as you do, so shall he do.
One ordinance shall be for you of the assembly and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations; as it is for you, so shall it be for the sojourner before Jehovah.
One law and one custom shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.
Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land to which I am bringing you,
then it shall be, when you eat of the bread of the land, that you shall offer up a heave offering unto Jehovah.
You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal as a heave offering; as a heave offering of the threshing floor, thus shall you offer it up.
Of the first of your ground meal you shall give unto Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.
If you sin unintentionally, and do not do all these commandments which Jehovah has spoken to Moses;
all that Jehovah has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day Jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations;
then it shall be, if it is done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the congregation, that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one kid of the goats as a sin offering.
Thus the priest shall make atonement for the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it was unintentional; they shall bring their offering, an offering by fire unto Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah, for their unintended sin.
It shall be forgiven the whole congregation of the children of Israel and the stranger who sojourns among them, because all the people did it unintentionally.
And if a soul sins unintentionally, then he shall bring a female goat of the first year as a sin offering.
Thus the priest shall make atonement for the soul who sins unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, for him who is a native among the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them.
But the soul who does anything loftily, whether he is a native or a sojourner, that one blasphemes Jehovah, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
Because he has despised the Word of Jehovah, and has broken His commandment, that soul shall be cut down to be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.
And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
And they put him under guard, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall be executed to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.
Therefore, as Jehovah commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died.
Again Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel and say to them to make fringes on the edges of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a violet thread in the fringes of the edges.
And the fringe shall be, that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, and that you not seek after that for which your own heart and eyes go whoring,
and that you remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.
I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.
Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;
and they rose up before Moses with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, representatives of the congregation, men of renown.
They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, You take too much upon yourselves, for all the congregation is holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?
And when Moses heard it, he fell on his face;
and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, Tomorrow morning Jehovah will show who is His and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to Him. The one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him.
Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company;
put fire in them and put incense in them before Jehovah tomorrow, and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah chooses is the holy one. You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!
And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:
Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the congregation to serve them;
and that He has brought you near to Himself, you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also?
Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Jehovah. And what is Aaron that you grumble against him?
And Moses sent to summon Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, We will not come up.
Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you rule to lord it over us?
Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!
And Moses was very angry, and said to Jehovah, Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I done evil to any of them.
And Moses said to Korah, Tomorrow, you and all your company be before Jehovah; you and they, as well as Aaron.
Each one take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before Jehovah, two hundred and fifty censers; you and Aaron, each with his censer.
And each man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the congregation.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
And they fell on their faces, and said, O Mighty God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will You be angry with all the congregation?
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
And Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.
So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little children.
And Moses said: By this you shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them from my own heart.
If these men die the death of all men, or if they are visited according to the visitation of all men, then Jehovah has not sent me.
But if Jehovah creates a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall understand that these men have rejected Jehovah.
And it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them,
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their houses and all the men with Korah, with all their possessions.
So they and all those with them went down alive into Sheol; the earth covered over them, and they perished from among the assembly.
And all Israel who were around them fled at the sound, for they thought, Lest the earth swallow us up also!
And a fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, that he pick up the censers out of the burning, for they are holy, and scatter the fire away.
The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into broad plates as a covering for the altar; because they presented them before Jehovah, therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had presented, and they were beaten out as a covering for the altar,
as a memorial to the children of Israel; that no strange man, who is not a seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before Jehovah, that he might not become like Korah and his company, as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses.
And the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, You have killed the people of Jehovah.
And it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting; and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
And Moses and Aaron came before the tent of meeting.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.
And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense on it, and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Jehovah; the plague has begun.
And Aaron took as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was restrained.
Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the matter of Korah.
And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tent of meeting, for the plague had been restrained.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them a staff, a staff from each father’s house, all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses; twelve staffs. Write each man’s name on his staff.
And you shall write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each father’s house.
And you shall place them in the tent of meeting before the Testimony, where I meet with you.
And it shall be that the staff of the man whom I choose shall blossom; thus I will put to rest the murmurings of the children of Israel, with which they grumble against you.
And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a staff apiece, for each leader a staff according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs; and the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.
And Moses placed the staffs before Jehovah in the tent of witness.
And it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tent of witness, and behold, the staff of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds.
And Moses brought out all the staffs from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his staff.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron’s staff back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebels, that you may put their murmurings away from Me, that they not die.
Thus Moses did; as Jehovah had commanded him, so he did.
And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold we have died, we have perished, we have all perished!
Whoever comes near the tabernacle of Jehovah dies. Are we all about to die? Have we been consumed?
And Jehovah said to Aaron: You and your sons and your father’s house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary, and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
Also bring with you your brethren of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may be joined with you and serve you while you and your sons are with you before the tent of witness.
They shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent; but they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that they not die; they and you also.
They shall be joined to you and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; but a stranger shall not come near you.
And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, that there be no more wrath upon the children of Israel.
And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel; they are a gift to you, given by Jehovah, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything at the altar and behind the veil; and you shall serve. I give your priesthood to you as a gift of service, but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
And Jehovah spoke to Aaron: I, behold I have also given you the charge of My heave offerings, all the holy things of the children of Israel; I have given them to you and your sons because of the anointing, as a perpetual ordinance.
This shall be yours of the set apart, holy, things from the fire: every offering of theirs, every grain offering and every sin offering and every trespass offering which they return to Me, shall be set apart, holy, for you and your sons.
In a set apart, holy place you shall eat it; every male shall eat it. It shall be holy to you.
This also is yours: the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them to you, and your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual ordinance. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat it.
All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and the grain, the firstfruits which they offer unto Jehovah, I have given them to you.
The first ripe fruit that is in their land which they bring unto Jehovah shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat it.
Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, which they bring unto Jehovah, whether man or beast, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall ransom to redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.
And the redeemed things you shall redeem after it is a month old, according to your valuation, for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; which is twenty gerahs.
But the firstborn of a cow, the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat with smoke as an offering by fire for a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And their flesh shall be yours, as the wave breast and the right thigh are yours.
All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual ordinance; it is a covenant of salt always before Jehovah with you and your seed with you.
And Jehovah said to Aaron: You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.
Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the service in which they serve, the service of the tent of meeting.
Neither shall the children of Israel come anymore near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin and die.
But the Levites shall do the work of service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute, throughout your generations, that they shall have no inheritance among the children of Israel.
For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up as a heave offering unto Jehovah, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, They shall have no inheritance among the children of Israel.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them: When you take from the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering of it unto Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.
And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and as the fullness of the winepress.
Thus you shall also offer a heave offering unto Jehovah from all your tithes which you receive from the children of Israel, and you shall give the heave offering of Jehovah from it to Aaron the priest.
Of all your gifts you shall offer up every heave offering of Jehovah, from all the best of them, the consecrated part of them.
Therefore you shall say to them: When you have lifted up the best of it, then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor and as the produce of the winepress.
You shall eat it in any place, you and your houses, for it is your wages for your service in the tent of meeting.
And you shall bear no sin because of it, when you have lifted up from it the best of it. And you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
This is the ordinance of the Law which Jehovah has commanded, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer that is whole, in which there is no blemish and upon which a yoke has never come.
You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall lead it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him;
and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times before the front of the tent of meeting.
And the heifer shall be burned before his eyes: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its dung shall be burned.
And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
Then the priest shall wash his clothes, he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening.
And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until evening.
And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for the water of impurity; it is for purifying from sin.
And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns among them.
He who touches a man, his soul having died, shall be unclean seven days.
He shall purify himself from it on the third day and on the seventh day; then he shall be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
Whoever touches a dead man, his soul having died, and does not purify himself, has defiled the tabernacle of Jehovah. That soul shall be cut off from Israel. He shall be unclean, because the water of impurity was not sprinkled upon him; his uncleanness is still upon him.
This is the law when a man dies in a tent: All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent shall be unclean seven days;
and every open vessel, which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean.
Whoever in the open field touches one who was pierced by a sword or who has died, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
And for the unclean they shall take some of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification from sin, and running water shall be put on them in a vessel.
A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or a grave.
The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, wash his clothes, and bathe in water; and at evening he shall be clean.
But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah. The water of impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.
It shall be a perpetual statute for them. He who sprinkles the water of impurity shall wash his clothes; and he who touches the water of impurity shall be unclean until evening.
And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul who touches it shall be unclean until evening.
And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there.
And there was no water for the congregation; so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.
And the people strove with Moses and spoke, saying: If only we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!
Why have you brought up the assembly of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die here?
And why have you brought us up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is not a place of sowing or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor is there any water to drink.
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and they fell on their faces. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Take the staff; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it shall produce water; thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their cattle.
And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah as He had commanded him.
And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water for you out of this rock?
And Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their cattle drank.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given to them.
These were the waters of Meribah, because the children of Israel strove with Jehovah, and He was sanctified among them.
And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom. Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the hardship that has befallen us,
how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and our fathers.
And when we cried out unto Jehovah, He heard our voice and sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.
Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King’s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.
And Edom said to him, You shall not pass through my land, lest I come out against you with the sword.
And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, without a word.
And he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against them with many people and with a strong hand.
Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel turned away from him.
And the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying:
Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My mouth at the waters of Meribah.
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.
And Moses did as Jehovah commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation.
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
And when all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron thirty days.
And when King Arad, the Canaanite who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel was coming on the way to Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
And Israel vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If You will grant to deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
And Jehovah heard the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called Hormah.
And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way.
And the people spoke against God and against Moses: Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.
And Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.
Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against Jehovah and against you; intercede before Jehovah that He take away the serpents from us. So Moses interceded for the people.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that anyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.
And Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.
And the children of Israel set out and encamped in Oboth.
And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.
From there they set out and encamped in the valley of Zered.
From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah: Waheb in Suphah, the brooks of the Arnon,
and the slope of the brooks that extends down to the dwelling of Ar, and leans on the border of Moab.
From there they went to Beer, which is the well where Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.
Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! All of you sing to it;
the well the rulers dug, dug by the nobles of the people, by the Lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,
from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the land of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down and faces the wilderness.
And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.
But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. And Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages.
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon.
Therefore those who speak in proverbs say: Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be repaired.
For fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of the Arnon.
Woe to you, Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.
But we have shot at them; Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon; and we laid waste as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
So they struck him, his sons, and all his people, until there was no survivor left; and they took possession of his land.
And the children of Israel set out, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan across from Jericho.
Now Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the presence of the children of Israel.
And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to summon him, saying: Behold, a people has come from Egypt. Behold, they cover the eye of the earth, and are staying next to me!
Therefore please come, curse this people for me, for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail and strike them and drive them out of the land, for I have perceived that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the diviner’s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.
And he said to them, Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as Jehovah speaks to me. So the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.
And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?
And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,
Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the eye of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall prevail to wage war and drive them out.
And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.
And Balaam arose in the morning and said to the rulers of Balak, Go back to your land, for Jehovah has refused to give me permission to go with you.
And the rulers of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.
And Balak again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than they.
And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;
for I will honor you with great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me. Therefore please come, curse this people for me.
And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the mouth of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight, that I may know what more Jehovah will say to me.
And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, If the men have come to summon you, arise and go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.
And Balaam arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the rulers of Moab.
And God’s anger burned because he went, and the Angel of Jehovah stationed Himself in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants with him.
And the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.
And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck her some more.
And the Angel of Jehovah went farther, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam’s anger burned, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?
And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have been cruel to me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would kill you!
And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since I became yours, to this day? Has it ever been my habit to do this to you? And he said, No.
Then Jehovah opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His sword drawn in His hand; and he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.
And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary against you, because your way is perverse before Me.
The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely now I would have killed you, and let her live.
And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know You were standing in the way against me. Now therefore, if it has been displeasing to Your eye, I will turn back.
And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the rulers of Balak.
And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is in the territory at the Arnon, at the border of the territory.
And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not reach out to send for you, to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not truly able to honor you?
And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you. Now, am I able at all to say anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.
And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth.
And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent some to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.
And it was the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people.
And Balaam said to Balak, Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will declare to you. So he went to a barren height.
And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
And Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.
And he returned to him, and lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, he and all the rulers of Moab.
And he took up his parable and said: Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me; and come, denounce Israel!
How shall I curse whom the Mighty God has not cursed? And how shall I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced?
For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Behold, a people dwelling alone, not being reckoned among the nations.
Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number one-fourth of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his!
And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and lo, you have blessed them to be adored!
And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak what Jehovah has put in my mouth?
And Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place from which you can see them; you shall see only the extremity of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.
And he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet over there.
And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.
And he came to him, and lo, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?
And he took up his parable and said: Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, son of Zippor!
The Mighty God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should be sorry. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken, and shall He not make it good?
Behold, I have been chosen to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
He has not observed trouble in Jacob, nor has He seen toil in Israel. Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a King is among them.
The Mighty God who brings them out of Egypt is like the lofty horns of an oryx.
For there is no omen against Jacob, nor any divination against Israel. It now must be said of Jacob and of Israel, Oh, what the Mighty God has done!
Behold, the people rise like a lioness, and lifts itself up like a lion; it shall not lie down until it devours the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.
And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!
And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not speak to you, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?
And Balak said to Balaam, Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will be agreeable in God’s eyes for you to curse them for me from there.
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down facing the wilderness.
And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.
Now when Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at other times, to encounter an omen of divination, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
And he took up his parable and said: The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,
the utterance of him who hears the Words of the Mighty God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with open eyes:
How delightful are your tents, O Jacob! Your dwellings, O Israel!
Like valleys that have been stretched out, like gardens by a river, like aloes planted by Jehovah, like cedars beside the waters.
He makes water flow from his buckets, and his seed in many waters, his king is higher than Agag, and his kingdom is exalted.
The Mighty God is bringing him out of Egypt; he has lofty horns like an oryx; he shall consume the nations, his enemies; he shall break their bones and pierce them with his arrows.
He has crouched, he has lain down as a lion, and as a lioness; who shall arouse him? Blessed is he who blesses you, and cursed is he who curses you.
And Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I summoned you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times!
Now therefore, flee to your place. I had thought to honor you with great honor, but behold, Jehovah has kept you back from honor.
So Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,
If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the mouth of Jehovah, to do good or bad of my own heart; but what Jehovah speaks, that I will speak?
And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the latter days.
And he took up his parable and said, The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, and the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;
the utterance of him who hears the words of the Mighty God, and has the knowledge of the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with open eyes:
I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; a Star shall come out of Jacob; a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shatter the extremities of Moab, and destroy all the seats of the sons of Seth.
And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession; and Israel shall do mightily.
Out of Jacob shall be One who has dominion, and has destroyed the remnants of the city.
Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his parable and said: Amalek was first among the nations, but his end shall be everlasting destruction.
And he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his parable and said: Firm is your dwelling place, and your nest is set in the rock;
nevertheless the Kenites shall be burned up, until Asshur carries you away captive.
And he took up his parable and said: Alas! Who shall live when the Mighty God brings this to pass?
But ships shall come from the coasts of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber, unto everlasting destruction.
And Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
And Israel remained in Shittim, and the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of Moab.
And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
And Israel was joined to Baal-peor, and the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people and hang them before Jehovah in broad daylight, that the burning anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.
And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal-peor.
And behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought in to his brethren a Midianite woman before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.
And when Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand;
and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman, through her belly. Thus the plague was stopped from the children of Israel.
And those who died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel, because he was zealous with My zeal among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My jealousy.
Therefore say, Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace;
and it shall be to him and his seed after him a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
Now the name of the man of Israel who was killed, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a ruler of a father’s house of the Simeonites.
And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head of a tribe of a father’s house in Midian.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Strike to harass the Midianites;
for they harassed you with their schemes by which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a ruler of Midian, their sister, who was killed in the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.
And it came to pass, after the plague, that Jehovah spoke to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying:
Take a head count of the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and above, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go to war in Israel.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying:
Count from twenty years old and above, as Jehovah has commanded Moses and the sons of Israel who came out of the land of Egypt.
Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;
of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.
These are the families of the Reubenites: those who were numbered of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.
And the son of Pallu was Eliab.
The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, called out of the congregation, who struggled against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, to struggle against Jehovah;
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign.
However the sons of Korah did not die.
The sons of Simeon according to their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites;
of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites; of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites.

These are the families of the sons of Gad according to those who were numbered of them: forty thousand five hundred.
The sons of Judah were Er and Onan; and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
And the sons of Judah according to their families: of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; of Perez, the family of the Parzites; of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites.
And the sons of Perez: of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites.
These are the families of Judah according to those who were numbered of them: seventy-six thousand five hundred.
The sons of Issachar according to their families: of Tola, the family of the Tolaites; of Puah, the family of the Punites;
of Jashub, the family of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the family of the Shimronites.
These are the families of Issachar according to those who were numbered of them: sixty-four thousand three hundred.
The sons of Zebulun according to their families: of Sered, the family of the Seredites; of Elon, the family of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites.
These are the families of the Zebulunites according to those who were numbered of them: sixty thousand five hundred.
The sons of Joseph according to their families: Manasseh and Ephraim.
The sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites; and Machir begot Gilead; of Gilead, the family of the Gileadites.
These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites; of Helek, the family of the Helekites;
of Asriel, the family of the Asrielites; of Shechem, the family of the Shechemites;
of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.
Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters; and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
These are the families of Manasseh; and those who were numbered of them were fifty-two thousand seven hundred.
These are the sons of Ephraim according to their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthelaites; of Becher, the family of the Becherites; of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites.
And these are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites.
These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those who were numbered of them: thirty-two thousand five hundred. These are the sons of Joseph according to their families.
The sons of Benjamin according to their families: of Bela, the family of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites;
of Shupham, the family of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites.
And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family of the Ardites; of Naaman, the family of the Naamites.
These are the sons of Benjamin according to their families; and those who were numbered of them were forty-five thousand six hundred.
These are the sons of Dan according to their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan according to their families.
All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those who were numbered of them, were sixty-four thousand four hundred.
The sons of Asher according to their families: of Jimnah, the family of the Jimnites; of Jesui, the family of the Jesuites; of Beriah, the family of the Beriites.
Of the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the family of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites.
And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serah.

These are the families of Naphtali according to their families; and those who were numbered of them were forty-five thousand four hundred.
These are the numbered ones of the children of Israel: six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
To these the land shall be divided as an inheritance, according to the number of names.
To the many you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the few you shall give a smaller inheritance. Each shall be given its inheritance at the mouth of those who were numbered of them.
But the land shall be divided by lot; they shall inherit according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
By the mouth of the lot their inheritance shall be divided between the many and the few.
And these are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.
These are the families of the Levites: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, and the family of the Korahites. And Kohath begot Amram.
The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron and Moses and their sister Miriam.
To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.
And those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and above; for they were not numbered among the other sons of Israel, because there was no inheritance given to them among the sons of Israel.
These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
But among these there was not a man of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
For Jehovah had said of them, They shall die the death in the wilderness. Thus there was not left a man of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, at the door of the tent of meeting, saying:
Our father died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against Jehovah, in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons.
Why should the name of our father be removed from among his family because he had no son? Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.
And Moses brought their case before Jehovah.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right. You shall assign to give them a possession of inheritance among their father’s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.
And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.
If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as Jehovah has commanded Moses.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.
And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.
For in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My mouth to sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying:
Let Jehovah the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,
who shall go out before them and go in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of Jehovah not be like sheep which have no shepherd.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand upon him;
make him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and commission him before their eyes.
And you shall ascribe some of your majesty upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.
And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before Jehovah for him according to the judgment of the Urim. At his mouth they shall go out, and at his mouth they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him; all the congregation.
So Moses did as Jehovah commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.
And he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, My food for My offerings by fire as a soothing aroma unto Me, you shall take heed to offer to Me at their appointed times.
And you shall say to them, This is the offering by fire which you shall offer unto Jehovah: two male lambs of the first year that are whole, day by day, as a continual burnt offering.
The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening,
and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil.
It is the continual burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
And its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy place you shall pour out the strong drink unto Jehovah as an offering.
The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer it as an offering by fire, a soothing aroma unto Jehovah.
And on the Sabbath day two lambs of the first year, that are whole, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering;
this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering with its drink offering.
At the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering unto Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year, that are whole;
three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram;
and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year.
And one kid of the goats as a sin offering unto Jehovah shall be offered, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of Jehovah.
And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days.
On the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.
And you shall present an offering by fire as a burnt offering unto Jehovah: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; ones that are whole.
Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah you shall offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram;
you shall offer one-tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs;
and one goat as a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, the continual burnt offering.
In this manner you shall offer the food of the offering by fire daily for seven days, as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.
And on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering unto Jehovah at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work.

with their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
and one kid of the goats, to make atonement for you.
You shall offer them with their drink offerings, besides the continual burnt offering with its grain offering. They shall be ones that are whole.
And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work. It is a day of shouting with trumpet blasts to you.
You shall offer a burnt offering as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year, that are whole.
Their grain offering shall be fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the ram,
and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
and one kid of the goats as a sin offering, to make atonement for you;
besides the burnt offering with its grain offering of the month, the continual burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to their ordinance, as a soothing aroma, an offering by fire unto Jehovah.
On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation. You shall afflict your souls; you shall not do any work.
You shall offer a burnt offering unto Jehovah as a soothing aroma: one young bull, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year. They shall be ones that are whole.
Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for the bull, two-tenths for the one ram,
and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs;
and one kid of the goats as a sin offering; besides the sin offering for atonement, the continual burnt offering with its grain offering, and their drink offerings.
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no labor of work, and you shall hold a feast unto Jehovah seven days.
You shall offer a burnt offering, an offering by fire as a soothing aroma unto Jehovah: thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year. They shall be ones that are whole.
Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams,

These you shall offer unto Jehovah at your appointed times (besides your vows and freewill offerings) as your burnt offerings and your grain offerings, as your drink offerings and your peace offerings.
Thus Moses said to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded:
If a man vows a vow unto Jehovah, or swears an oath to bind his soul to a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
If a woman vows a vow unto Jehovah, and has bound her soul to a bond while in her father’s house in her youth,
and her father has heard her vow and the bond by which she has bound her soul, and her father has remained silent, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond to which she has bound her soul shall stand.
But if her father has disallowed her on the day that he hears, then none of her vows nor her bonds by which she has bound her soul shall stand; and Jehovah will forgive her, because her father has disallowed her.
And if she belongs to a husband, when she has bound her soul with a vow or rash utterance of her lips,
and her husband has heard, and has kept silent to her on the day that he hears, then her vows have been confirmed, and her bonds by which she bound her soul shall stand.
But if her husband disallows her on the day that he hears it, he has made void her vow which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul; and Jehovah will forgive her.
But any vow of a widow or a divorced woman, by which she has bound her soul, shall be confirmed against her.
If she has vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,
and her husband has heard it, and kept silent to her and has not disallowed her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond by which she has bound her soul has been confirmed.
But if her husband disallows, to void them on the day he hears them, then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand; her husband has made them void; and Jehovah will forgive her.
Every vow and every binding oath to humble her soul, her husband may confirm it, or her husband may make it void.
But if her husband is silent and says nothing to her from day to day, then he has confirmed all her vows or all the bonds that are upon her; he has confirmed them, because he has remained silent to her on the day that he heard them.
And if he does disallow, to make them void after he has heard them, then he has taken on her guilt.
These are the statutes which Jehovah has commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter in her youth in her father’s house.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Execute vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.
And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Midianites to give vengeance from Jehovah upon Midian.
A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.
So there were assigned from the thousands of Israel one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
And Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from each tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy vessels and the signal trumpets in his hand.
And they warred against the Midianites, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and they killed all the males.
And they killed the kings of Midian with the rest of those who were killed; Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword.
And the sons of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoils all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their wealth.
They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their fortifications.
And they took all the spoils and all the booty; of man and beast.
And they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoils to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp.
And Moses was angry with the officers of the army, with the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, who had come from the battle.
And Moses said to them: Have you kept alive all the women and let them live?
Behold, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of Jehovah.
Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by lying with a male.
But keep alive for yourselves all the female children who have not known a male by lying with him.
And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any soul, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
And purify every garment, everything made of skins, everything woven of goats’ hair, and everything made of wood.
And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:
Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
everything that can pass through the fire, you shall put through the fire, and it shall be clean; and it shall be purified with the water of impurity. And all that cannot pass through the fire you shall put through water.
And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.
Now Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying:
Take a head count of the prey of the captives, of man and beast; you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation;
and divide the booty between those who took part in the war who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
And levy a tribute unto Jehovah upon the men of war who went out to battle: one of every five hundred of the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep;
take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering unto Jehovah.
And from the children of Israel’s half you shall take one of every fifty, of man, from the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock; and give them to the Levites who keep charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
The booty remaining from the plunder, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,
seventy-two thousand cattle,
sixty-one thousand donkeys,
and thirty-two thousand souls of mankind in all, of women who had not known a male by lying with him.
And the half, the portion for those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep;
and the tribute unto Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five.
The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was seventy-two.
The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was sixty-one.
The souls of mankind were sixteen thousand, of which the tribute unto Jehovah was thirty-two souls.
And Moses gave the tribute which was Jehovah’s heave offering to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And from the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men who went to war:
(Now the half belonging to the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
thirty-six thousand cattle,
thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
and sixteen thousand souls of mankind.)
From the children of Israel’s half Moses took one of every fifty, from man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And the officers who were over thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses;
and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken a head count of the men of war who are under our hand, and not a man of us is missing.
Therefore we have brought an offering unto Jehovah, from what every man has found of articles of gold: armlets and bracelets and rings and earrings and ornaments, to make atonement for ourselves before Jehovah.
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all the crafted articles.
And all the gold of the offering which they offered unto Jehovah, from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
(The men of war had taken spoils, every man for himself.)
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.
Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great number of livestock; and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that behold the place was a place for livestock,
the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon,
the land which Jehovah has struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.
Therefore they said, If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not cause us to pass over the Jordan.
And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben: Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here?
Now why will you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Jehovah has given them?
Thus your fathers did when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, so that they did not go into the land which Jehovah had given them.
And the anger of Jehovah burned that day, and He swore, saying,
Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and above, shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they have not wholly followed Me,
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed Jehovah.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah was destroyed.
And behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of Jehovah against Israel.
For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you shall have destroyed all this people.
And they came near to him and said: We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,
but we ourselves will be armed, ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
We will not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has received his inheritance.
For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.
And Moses said to them: If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before Jehovah for war,
and you all cross over the Jordan armed before Jehovah until He has driven out His enemies before Him,
and the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterward you may return and be blameless before Jehovah and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.
But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned against Jehovah; and recognize that your sin will find you out.
Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.
And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: Your servants will do as my lord commands.
Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, just as my lord says.
So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
And Moses said to them: If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession.
But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying: As Jehovah has said to your servants, so we will do.
We will cross over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.
And Moses gave to the sons of Gad, to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding land.
And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,
Atroth-shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,
Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, fortified cities, and folds for sheep.
And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim,
Nebo and Baal-meon (their names being changed) and Shibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built.
And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.
And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.
And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah, after his own name.
These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went out of the land of Egypt by their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
And Moses wrote down the starting places of their journeys at the mouth of Jehovah. And these are their journeys according to their starting places:
They set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand before the eyes of all the Egyptians.
For the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom Jehovah had struck among them. Also upon their gods Jehovah had executed judgments.
And the children of Israel set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.

And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the mouth of Jehovah, and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month.
Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
And the king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
They camped by the Jordan, from Beth Jesimoth as far as Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you, destroy all their carved figures, destroy all their images, and annihilate all their high places;
you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
And you shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your families; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance; there everyone’s inheritance shall be whatever falls to him by lot. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be thorns in your eyes and pricks in your sides, and they shall distress you in the land where you dwell.
Moreover it shall be that I will do to you as I had thought to do to them.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance; the land of Canaan to its borders.
Your southern border shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside Edom; and your southern border shall be eastward to the end of the Salt Sea;
your border shall turn from the southern side of the ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and be on the south of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go on to Hazar Addar, and continue to Azmon;
the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the Sea.
As for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your western border.
And this shall be your northern border: From the Great Sea you shall mark out to Mount Hor;
from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the extremity of the border shall be toward Zedad;
the border shall proceed to Ziphron, and it shall end at Hazar Enan. This shall be your northern border.
You shall mark out your eastern border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;
the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain; the border shall go down and reach to the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth;
the border shall go down along the Jordan, and it shall end at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with its surrounding borders.
And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.
For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and the half-tribe of Manasseh has received its inheritance.
The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance on the other side of the Jordan, across from Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
And you shall take one leader of every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance.
These are the names of the men: from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
from the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;
from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;
the leader from the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli;
from the sons of Joseph: the leader from the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod,
and the leader from the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
the leader from the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach;
the leader from the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan;
the leader from the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
and the leader from the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
These are the ones Jehovah has commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying:
Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possessions, and you shall also give the Levites common land around the cities.
They shall have the cities to dwell in; and their common land shall be for their cattle, for their herds, and for all their animals.
The common land of the cities which you shall give the Levites shall extend from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around.
And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. The city shall be in the middle. This shall be to them as common land for the cities.
And among the cities which you shall give to the Levites you shall appoint six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities.
So all the cities you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight; these you shall give with their common lands.
And the cities which you shall give shall be from the possession of the children of Israel; from the larger tribe you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, according to the inheritance that each receives.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any soul accidentally may flee there.
They shall be cities of refuge for you from the kinsman avenger, that the manslayer may not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.
And out of the cities which you give, you shall have six cities of refuge.
You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a soul accidentally may flee there.
But if he strikes him with an implement of iron, so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.
And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.
Or if he strikes him with a wooden implement in the hand, by which one could die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be executed to death.
The kinsman avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
If he pushes him out of hatred, or while lying in wait has thrown something at him, so that he dies,
or in enmity he has struck him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck him shall be executed to death. He is a murderer. The kinsman avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
However, if he has pushed him suddenly without enmity, or has thrown anything at him without lying in wait,
or a stone, by which a man could die, which falls on him without seeing him, so that he dies, while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm;
then the congregation shall judge between the manslayer and the kinsman avenger of blood according to these judgments.
Thus the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the kinsman avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and he shall remain there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil.
But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the borders of the city of refuge where he fled,
and the kinsman avenger of blood finds him outside the borders of his city of refuge, and the kinsman avenger of blood kills the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of blood,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.
And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Whoever kills a soul, the murderer shall be put to death at the mouth of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against a soul for him to die.
Moreover you shall take no ransom for the soul of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall be executed to death.
And you shall take no ransom for him to flee to his city of refuge, to return to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.
Thus you shall not pollute the land where you are; for blood pollutes the land. And no atonement can be made for the land, for the blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of him who sheds it.
Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst of which I dwell; for I, Jehovah, dwell among the children of Israel.
Now the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the chief fathers of the children of Israel.
And they said: Jehovah commanded my lord Moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
Now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
And Moses commanded the children of Israel at the mouth of Jehovah, saying: What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right.
This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whoever is good in their eyes, but they shall marry only within the family of the tribe of their father.
Thus the inheritance of the children of Israel shall not turn about from tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
And every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be the wife of one of the family of her father’s tribe, so that the children of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
Thus no inheritance shall turn about from one tribe to another tribe, but every tribe of the children of Israel shall cling to its own inheritance.
Thus, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;
for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to the sons of their father’s brothers.
They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their fathers.
These are the commandments and the judgments which Jehovah commanded the children of Israel by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho.
These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain opposite Suph, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
(It takes eleven days to get from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.)
And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah had given him commandment concerning them,
after he had struck Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth in Edrei.
On this side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this Law, saying,
Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have dwelt long enough at this mountain.
Turn and set out, and go to the mountains of the Amorites, to all the neighboring places in the plain, in the mountains and in the lowland, in the South and on the seacoast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the River Euphrates.
Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; to give to them and their seed after them.
And I spoke to you at that time, saying: I alone am not able to bear you.
Jehovah your God has multiplied you, and here you are today, as the stars of the heavens in multitude.
May Jehovah the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has promised you!
How can I alone bear your burdens and your loads and your disputes?
Choose wise, understanding, and knowledgeable men from among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
And you answered me and said, The thing which you have spoken to us is good to do.
So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and knowledgeable men, and made them heads over you, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, rulers of tens, and officials for your tribes.
And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the sojourner.
You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of any man’s presence, for the judgment is God’s. And any matter that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.
And I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.
So we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and dreadful wilderness which you have seen on the way to the mountains of the Amorites, as Jehovah our God had commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
And I said to you, You have come to the mountains of the Amorites, which Jehovah our God is giving to us.
Behold, Jehovah your God has set the land before you; go up and possess it, as Jehovah the God of your fathers has spoken to you; do not fear or be dismayed.
And all of you came near to me and said, Let us send men before us, and let them search out the land for us, and bring back word to us of the way by which we should go up, and of the cities into which we shall come.
And the thing was good in my eyes; so I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe.
And they turned and went up into the mountains, and came to the Valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
They also took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they brought back word to us, saying, It is a good land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.
Nevertheless you would not go up, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God;
and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Jehovah hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Where shall we go up? Our brethren have caused our hearts to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the heavens; moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
Then I said to you, Do not be terrified, nor afraid of them.
Jehovah your God, who goes before you, He will fight for you, according to all that He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
and in the wilderness where you have seen how Jehovah your God has carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.
Yet, for all that, you did not believe Jehovah your God,
who went in the way before you to search out a place for you to encamp, to show you the way you should go, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day.
And Jehovah heard the sound of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,
Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers,
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his children I am giving the land upon which he has walked, because he has wholly followed Jehovah.
Jehovah was also angry with me on account of you, saying, You also shall not go in there.
Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
Moreover your little ones and your children, whom you say will be prey, who today have no knowledge of good and evil, they shall go in there; to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
But as for you, turn and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.
Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Jehovah; we will go up and fight, just as Jehovah our God commanded us. And each of you girded on his weapons of war, and were ready to go up into the mountain.
And Jehovah said to me, Say to them, Do not go up nor fight, for I am not among you; lest you be struck down before your enemies.
So I spoke to you; yet you would not listen, but rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah, and presumptuously went up into the mountain.
And the Amorites who dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do, and shattered you in pieces from Seir to Hormah.
And you returned and wept before Jehovah, but Jehovah would not listen to your voice nor give ear to you.
So you remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained there.
Then we turned and set out into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as Jehovah had spoken to me, and we circled around Mount Seir many days.
And Jehovah spoke to me, saying:
You have circled around this mountain long enough; turn northward.
And command the people, saying, You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be very much on guard.
Do not strive with them, for I am not giving you any of their land, no, not even one treading place for the souls of your feet, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
You shall buy food from them with money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.
For Jehovah your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands. He has known your walking through this great wilderness. These forty years Jehovah your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.
And when we passed beyond our brethren, the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, away from the way of the plain, away from Elath and Ezion Geber, we turned and passed by way of the wilderness of Moab.
And Jehovah said to me, Do not show hostility to Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot as a possession.
(The Emim had dwelt there in times past, a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim.
They were also regarded as giants, like the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
The Horites formerly dwelt in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their place, just as Israel has done to the land of their possession which Jehovah has given them.)
Now rise up and cross over the valley of the Zered. So we crossed over the valley of the Zered.
And the time that passed from Kadesh Barnea until we had crossed over the valley of the Zered was thirty-eight years, for all the generation of the men of war to be finished off from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn to them.
For indeed the hand of Jehovah was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp until they were consumed.
So it was, when all the men of war had completely perished from among the people,
that Jehovah spoke to me, saying:
This day you are crossing over at Ar, the border of Moab.
And when you come near the children of Ammon, do not show hostility to them nor contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.
(That was also regarded as a land of giants; giants formerly dwelt there. But the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,
a people as great and numerous and tall as the Anakim. But Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them and dwelt in their place,
just as He had done for the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and dwelt in their place, even to this day.
And the Avim, who dwelt in villages as far as Gaza; the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their place.)
Rise up, set out, and cross over the river Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it, and engage him in battle.
This day I will begin to put the dread and terror of you upon the faces of the peoples under all the heavens, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and writhe because of you.
And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
Let me pass through your land; I will proceed directly on the way; I will neither turn aside to the right nor to the left.
You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,
just as the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar did for me, until I cross the Jordan to the land which Jehovah our God is giving to us.
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through; for Jehovah your God had made his spirit stubborn and hardened his heart, that He might deliver him into your hand, as it is this day.
And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have begun to set Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess it, that you may inherit his land.
And Sihon and all his people came out against us to do battle at Jahaz.
And Jehovah our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people.
We took all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed the men, women, and little ones of every city; we left none remaining.
We took only the livestock as plunder for ourselves, with the spoils of the cities which we took.
From Aroer, which is beside the River Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us; Jehovah our God delivered up all before us.
Only you did not go near the land of the children of Ammon; anywhere along the River Jabbok, nor to the cities of the mountains, nor wherever Jehovah our God had forbidden us.
Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan; and Og king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
And Jehovah said to me, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him and all his people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
So Jehovah our God also delivered into our hands Og king of Bashan, with all his people, and we struck him until he had no survivors remaining.
And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a great many rural towns.
And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
And all the livestock and the spoils of the cities we plundered for ourselves.
And at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon
(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir),
all the cities of the plain, all Gilead, and all Bashan, as far as Salcah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the giants. Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead (Is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon.): Nine cubits its length and four cubits its width, according to the cubit of a man.
And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer by the River Arnon, and half the mountains of Gilead and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites.
The rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (All the region of Argob, with all Bashan, was called the land of the giants.
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and called Bashan after his own name, Havoth Jair, to this day.)
I also gave Gilead to Machir.
And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave from Gilead as far as the River Arnon, the middle of the river as the border, as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
the plain also, with the Jordan as the border, from Chinnereth as far as the east side of the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.
Then I commanded you at that time, saying: Jehovah your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of war shall cross over armed before your brethren, the children of Israel.
But your wives, your little ones, and your livestock (I know that you have much livestock) shall remain in your cities which I have given you,
until Jehovah has given rest to your brethren as He has to you, and they also possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you shall return to his possession which I have given to you.
And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to these two kings; so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms through which you pass.
You shall not fear them, for Jehovah your God Himself fights for you.
Then I besought Jehovah at that time, saying:
O Lord Jehovah, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand, for what god is there in the heavens or on earth who can do according to Your works and Your might?
I pray, let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan, those pleasant mountains, and Lebanon.
But Jehovah was angry with me on your account, and would not listen to me. And Jehovah said to me: Enough from you! Speak no more to Me of this matter.
Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan.
But commission Joshua, and encourage him and make him bold; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.
So we remained in the valley across from Beth Peor.
Now, O Israel, listen to the statutes and the judgments which I am teaching you to do, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving to you.
You shall not add to the Word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.
Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did at Baal-Peor; for Jehovah your God has destroyed from among you all the men who followed Baal-peor.
But you who held fast to Jehovah your God are alive today, every one of you.
Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, just as Jehovah my God has commanded me, for you to do them in the midst of the land which you are going in to possess.
Keep and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the peoples who will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
For what great nation is there whose God is near to it, as Jehovah our God is to us, in all that we call upon Him?
And what great nation is there that has such statutes and righteous judgments as are in all this Law which I am setting before you this day?
Only take heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently, that you not forget the things your eyes have seen, and that they not depart from your heart all the days of your life; and teach them to your children and your grandchildren.
The day you stood before Jehovah your God in Horeb, Jehovah said to me, Gather the people to Me, and I will make them hear My Words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.
And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of the heavens, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.
And Jehovah spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; you only heard a voice.
Thus He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to do, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone.
And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, for you to do them in the land which you are crossing over to possess.
Take diligent heed to your souls, for you saw no form on the day Jehovah spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire,
that you not act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any statue: male or female figures,
the figure of any beast on the earth or the figure of any bird that flies in the heavens,
the figure of anything that creeps on the ground or the figure of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth.
And take heed, when you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of the heavens, that you not be driven to bow down to them and serve them, which Jehovah your God has allotted to all the peoples under the heavens.
But Jehovah has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be His people, an inheritance, as you are this day.
Furthermore Jehovah was angry with me on account of your words, and swore that I would not cross over the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance.
But I shall die in this land, I shall not cross over the Jordan; but you shall cross over and possess that good land.
Take heed to yourselves, that you not forget the covenant of Jehovah your God which He has made with you, and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Jehovah your God has forbidden you.
For Jehovah your God is a consuming fire, a jealous Mighty God.
When you beget children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and have acted corruptly and made a carved image in the form of anything, and have done evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God to provoke Him to anger,
I call the heavens and the earth to witness against you this day, that you shall quickly die and perish from off the land which you are crossing over the Jordan to possess; you shall not prolong your days in it, but shall be destroyed to annihilation.
And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations where Jehovah will drive you.
And there you will serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
But from there you will seek Jehovah your God, and you shall find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
When you are in distress, and all these things have come upon you in the latter days; then when you have returned unto Jehovah your God and have obeyed His voice
(for Jehovah your God is a merciful Mighty God), He will not forsake you nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which He has sworn unto them.
For ask now concerning the former days, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of the heavens to the other, whether any great thing like this has happened, or anything like it has been heard.
Has any people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and lived?
Or has God ever tried to go and take for Himself a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Jehovah your God has done for you in Egypt before your eyes?
To you it has been shown, that you might know that Jehovah Himself is God; there is no one else besides Him.
Out of the heavens He has caused you to hear His voice, to instruct you; on earth He has shown you His great fire, and you have heard His Words out of the midst of the fire.
And because He has loved your fathers, therefore He chose their seed after them and brought you out of Egypt before Him with His mighty power,
to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day.
Therefore know this day, and consider it in your heart, that Jehovah Himself is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath; there is no other.
You shall therefore keep His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you today, that it may be well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you for all time.
Then Moses set apart three cities on this side of the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without having hated him in time past, and that by fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
Now this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel after they came out of Egypt,
across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck when they came out of Egypt.
And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were across the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
from Aroer, which is next to the River Arnon, even to Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),
and all the plain on the east side of the Jordan as far as the sea of the plain, below the slopes of Pisgah.
And Moses summoned all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I am speaking in your ears today, that you may learn them and take heed to do them.
Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
Jehovah did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all those of us who are alive here today.
Jehovah talked with you face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire.
I stood between Jehovah and you at that time, to declare to you the Word of Jehovah (for you were afraid of the presence of the fire, and you did not go up the mountain), saying:
I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
You shall have no other gods before Me.
You shall not make for yourself a carved image; any likeness of anything in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth;
you shall not bow down to them nor serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous Mighty God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.
Keep the Sabbath day, to be holy, as Jehovah your God has commanded you.
Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Jehovah your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore Jehovah your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
Honor your father and your mother, as Jehovah your God has commanded you, that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.
You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
You shall not desire your neighbor’s wife; and you shall not covet your neighbor’s house, his field, his male servant, his female servant, his ox, his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor’s.
These words Jehovah has spoken to all your assembly, on the mountain from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and He has added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
And so it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
And you said, Behold, Jehovah our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. We have seen this day that God speaks with man, yet he lives.
Now therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God anymore, then we shall die!
For who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
You go near and hear all that Jehovah our God shall say, and you speak to us all that Jehovah our God shall speak to you; and we will hear and do it.
And Jehovah heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me, and Jehovah said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
Oh, that this heart of theirs would be fully yielded, to fear Me and to keep all My commandments at all times, that it might be well with them and with their children forever!
Go and say to them, Return to your tents.
But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will speak to you all the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I am giving them to possess.
Therefore, take heed to do as Jehovah your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
You shall walk in all the ways which Jehovah your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.
Now these are the commandments, the statutes and judgments which Jehovah your God has commanded to teach you, to do them in the land which you are crossing over to possess,
that you may fear Jehovah your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you, you and your sons and your grandsons, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged.
Therefore hear, O Israel, and take heed to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers has promised you; a land flowing with milk and honey.
Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God, Jehovah is one.
And you shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart, with all your soul, exceedingly in every way.
And these Words which I am commanding you today shall be in your heart.
You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
And it shall be, when Jehovah your God shall have brought you into the land of which He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and good cities which you have not built,
houses full of all good things, which you have not filled, hewn-out wells which you have not dug, vineyards and olive trees which you have not planted; when you have eaten and are full;
then be on guard that you not forget Jehovah who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
You shall fear Jehovah your God and serve Him, and swear by His name.
You shall not go after other gods, the gods of the peoples who are all around you
(for Jehovah your God is a jealous Mighty God among you), lest the anger of Jehovah your God burn against you and destroy you from off the face of the earth.
You shall not tempt Jehovah your God as you tempted Him in Massah.
You shall take heed to keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, His testimonies, and His statutes which He has commanded you.
And you shall do what is right and good in the eyes of Jehovah, that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers,
to cast out all your enemies before you, as Jehovah has spoken.
When your son asks you in the future, saying, What are the testimonies, the statutes, and the judgments which Jehovah our God has commanded you?
then you shall say to your son: We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
and Jehovah gave signs and wonders before our eyes, great and severe, against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his house.
And He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in, to give us the land of which He had sworn to our fathers.
And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Jehovah our God, for our good always, to preserve us alive, as it is this day.
And it shall be righteousness for us if we take heed to do all these commandments before Jehovah our God, as He has commanded us.
When Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are going in to possess, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you,
and when Jehovah your God has delivered them over to you, you shall strike them and destroy to exterminate them. You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them.
Nor shall you make marriages with them. You shall not give your daughter to their son, nor take their daughter for your son.
For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; and the anger of Jehovah will burn against you and quickly destroy you.
But thus you shall deal with them: you shall break down their altars, and shatter their pillars, and chop down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
For you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God; Jehovah your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure out of all the peoples upon the face of the earth.
Jehovah did not set His love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples;
but because Jehovah loves you, and to keep the oath which He has sworn to your fathers, Jehovah has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
Therefore know that Jehovah your God, He is God, the faithful Mighty God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments;
and He repays those who hate Him, to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slack with him who hates Him; He will repay him to his face.
Therefore you shall keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which I am commanding you today, to do them.
Then it shall come to pass, because you obey these judgments, and keep and do them, that Jehovah your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He has sworn to your fathers.
And He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flock, in the land of which He has sworn to your fathers to give you.
You shall be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be sterility or barrenness among you or among your livestock.
And Jehovah will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
And you shall destroy all the peoples whom Jehovah your God is delivering over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.
If you should think in your heart, These nations are greater than I; how can I dispossess them?
you shall not be afraid of them, but you shall call to mind to remember what Jehovah your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:
the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which Jehovah your God has brought you out. Thus shall Jehovah your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
Moreover Jehovah your God will send the hornet among them, for those who are left, who hide themselves from your face, to perish.
You shall not be terrified of them; for Jehovah your God, the great and awesome Mighty God, is among you.
And Jehovah your God will clear away those nations before you little by little; you shall not prevail to destroy them all at once, lest the beasts of the field become too numerous for you.
But Jehovah your God will deliver them over to you, and will defeat them with great confusion to annihilate them.
And He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall destroy their name from under the heavens; no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them.
You shall burn the graven images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to Jehovah your God.
Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be utterly destroyed like it. You shall detest it unto abomination and loathe it unto abhorrence, for it is a prohibited thing.
Every commandment which I am commanding you today you shall take heed to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers.
And you shall remember that Jehovah your God has led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
And He humbled you, allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna which you had not known nor had your fathers known, to make you know that man does not live by bread alone; but man lives by every Word that proceeds from the mouth of Jehovah.
Your garments did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years.
You have come to know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so Jehovah your God chastens you.
Therefore you shall keep the commandments of Jehovah your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.
For Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, that flow out of valleys and hills;
a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;
a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity, in which you shall lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
When you have eaten and been filled, then you shall bless Jehovah your God for the good land which He has given you.
Beware that you do not forget Jehovah your God by not keeping His commandments, His judgments, and His statutes which I am commanding you today,
lest, when you have eaten and been filled, and have built beautiful houses and dwelt in them;
and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold are multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
when your heart is lifted up, and you forget Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with the fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land with no water; who has brought water for you out of the rock of flint;
who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers had not known, to humble you and to test you, to do you good in the end;
you say in your heart, My power and the might of my hand have acquired me this wealth.
But you shall remember Jehovah your God, for it is He who gives you power to acquire wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He has sworn to your fathers, as it is this day.
And it shall be, if you cease caring, to forget Jehovah your God, and have walked after other gods, and have served them and bowed down to them, I testify against you this day that you shall perish to extermination.
As the nations which Jehovah is destroying before you, so you shall perish, because you would not obey the voice of Jehovah your God.
Hear, O Israel: You are crossing over the Jordan today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the heavens,
a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you have known, and of whom you have heard it said, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?
Therefore understand today that Jehovah your God is He who goes over before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and bring them down before you; thus you shall dispossess them and destroy them quickly, as Jehovah has spoken to you.
Do not think in your heart, after Jehovah your God has cast them out before you, saying, Because of my righteousness Jehovah has brought me in to possess this land; but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is driving them out before you.
It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah your God is driving them out before you, and that He may fulfill the word which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers; to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
Therefore understand that Jehovah your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.
Remember; do not forget how you provoked Jehovah your God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Jehovah.
Also in Horeb you provoked Jehovah to wrath, so that Jehovah was angry with you to have destroyed you.
When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which Jehovah had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water.
And Jehovah gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them were all the words which Jehovah had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Jehovah had given me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
And Jehovah said to me, Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I have commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image.
Furthermore Jehovah spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.
Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under the heavens; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.
So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.
And I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Jehovah your God, and had made for yourselves a molten calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which Jehovah had commanded you.
And I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.
For I was afraid of the anger and fury with which Jehovah had been angry with you, to destroy you. But Jehovah gave heed to me at that time also.
And Jehovah was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
And I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed and ground it thoroughly, until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that was coming down from the mountain.
Also at Taberah and Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Jehovah to wrath.
Likewise, when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you, then you rebelled against the mouth of Jehovah your God, and you did not believe Him nor obey His voice.
You have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you.
Thus I prostrated myself before Jehovah; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because Jehovah had thought to annihilate you.
Therefore I prayed to Jehovah, and said: O Lord Jehovah, do not destroy Your people and Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin,
lest the land from which You have brought us should say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.
Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.
At that time Jehovah said to me, Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain and make yourself an ark of wood.
And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you have broken; and you shall put them in the ark.
And I made an ark of acacia wood, hewed two tablets of stone like the first, and went up into the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.
And He wrote on the tablets according to the first writing, the Ten Commandments, which Jehovah had spoken to you in the mountain from the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly; and Jehovah gave them to me.
And I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as Jehovah had commanded me.
(Now the children of Israel journeyed from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died, and where he was buried; and Eleazar his son served as priest in his place.
From there they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of rivers of water.
At that time Jehovah had separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to serve Him and to bless in His name, to this day.
Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance, just as Jehovah your God has spoken to him.)
And, as at the first time, I stayed in the mountain forty days and forty nights; Jehovah also had given heed to me at that time, and Jehovah had consented to not destroy you.
And Jehovah said to me, Arise, proceed on your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.
And now, Israel, what is Jehovah your God asking of you, but to fear Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
and to keep the commandments of Jehovah and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good.
Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of the heavens, and also the earth with all that is in it, belong to Jehovah your God.
Jehovah has longed for your fathers, to love them; and He chose their seed after them, you out of all peoples, as it is this day.
Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no more;
for Jehovah your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great Mighty God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe.
He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, to give him food and clothing.
Therefore love the sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
You shall fear Jehovah your God; you shall serve Him, and cleave to Him, and you shall swear by His name.
He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which your eyes have seen.
Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons, and now Jehovah your God has made you as the stars of the heavens for multitude.
Therefore you shall love Jehovah your God, and keep His charge, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments always.
Know today that I am not speaking with your children, who have not known and who have not seen the chastening of Jehovah your God, His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm;
His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;
what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and how Jehovah destroyed them to this day;
what He has done for you in the wilderness to come to this place;
and what He has done to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their houses, their tents, and all the substance at their feet, in the midst of all Israel;
but your eyes have been seeing every great work of Jehovah which He has done.
Therefore you shall keep every commandment which I am commanding you today, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land which you are crossing over to possess,
and that you may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers, to give to them and their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.
For the land which you are going to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot, as a vegetable garden;
but the land which you are crossing over to possess is a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water from the rain of the heavens,
a land for which Jehovah your God cares; the eyes of Jehovah your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
And it shall be that if you give heed to obey My commandments which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul,
then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil.
And I will produce grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.
Take heed to yourselves, that your heart not be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods and bow down to them,
and the anger of Jehovah burn against you, and He shut up the heavens so that there be no rain, and the land yield no produce, and you perish quickly from the good land which Jehovah is giving to you.
Therefore you shall fix these words of mine in your hearts and in your souls, and shall bind them as a sign on your hands, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.
You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.
And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers to give to them, like the days of the heavens above the earth.
For if you give heed to keep all these commandments which I am commanding you to do; to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to cleave unto Him;
then Jehovah will drive out all these nations before you, and you shall dispossess nations that are greater and mightier than yourselves.
Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the River Euphrates, even to the western Sea, shall be your territory.
No man shall be able to stand against you; Jehovah your God will put the dread of you and the fear of you upon all the land where you tread, as He has spoken to you.
Behold, I set before you today a blessing and a curse:
the blessing, if you obey the commandments of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you today;
and the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of Jehovah your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, to go after other gods which you have not known.
And it shall be, when Jehovah your God brings you into the land which you are going in to possess, that you shall put the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
Are they not on the other side of the Jordan, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the plain opposite Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh.
For you are crossing over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and dwell in it.
And take heed to do all the statutes and judgments which I am setting before you today.
These are the statutes and judgments which you shall take heed to do in the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers is giving you to possess, all the days that you live on the earth:
You shall destroy to blot out all the places where the nations which you are dispossessing have served their gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.
And you shall tear down their altars, break their sacred pillars, and burn their groves with fire; you shall chop down the graven images of their gods and destroy their names out of that place.
You shall not do so unto Jehovah your God.
But you shall regularly seek out the place where Jehovah your God chooses, out of all your tribes, to put His name for His dwelling place; and there you shall go.
There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, your vows, your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
And there you shall eat before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice in all to which you have put your hand, you and your households, in which Jehovah your God has blessed you.
You shall not do as we are doing here today; every man doing whatever is right in his own eyes;
for as yet you have not come to the rest and the inheritance which Jehovah your God is giving to you.
But when you have crossed over the Jordan and dwelt in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to inherit, and He has given you rest from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety,
then there shall be the place which Jehovah your God will choose to establish His name. There you shall bring all that I am commanding you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the heave offerings of your hand, and all your choice offerings which you vow unto Jehovah.
And you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your sons and your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place that you see;
but in the place which Jehovah chooses, in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I am commanding you.
However, you may slaughter and eat flesh within all your gates, whatever your soul desires, according to the blessing of Jehovah your God which He has given you; the unclean and the clean may eat of it, of the gazelle and the deer alike.
Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
You cannot eat within your gates the tithe of your grain or your new wine or your oil, of the firstborn of your herd or your flock, of any of your vows which you vow, of your freewill offerings, or of the heave offering of your hand.
But you shall eat them before Jehovah your God in the place which Jehovah your God chooses, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates; and you shall rejoice before Jehovah your God in all to which you put your hands.
Take heed to yourself that you do not forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.
When Jehovah your God enlarges your border as He has promised you, and you say, Let me eat flesh, because your soul longs to eat flesh, you may eat as much flesh as your soul desires.
If the place where Jehovah your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, then you shall slaughter from your herd and from your flock which Jehovah has given you, as I have commanded you, and you shall eat within your gates whatever your soul desires.
Just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so you shall eat them; the unclean and the clean alike shall eat them.
Only be sure not to eat the blood, for the blood is the soul; you shall not eat the soul with the flesh.
You shall not eat it; you shall pour it on the earth like water.
You shall not eat it, that it may go well with you and your children after you, when you do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Only, the holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which Jehovah chooses.
And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Jehovah your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Jehovah your God, and you shall eat the flesh.
Take heed and obey all these words which I am commanding you, that it may go well with you and your children after you always, when you do what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.
When Jehovah your God cuts off before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you have taken possession and dwelt in their land,
take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them, after they are destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? I also will do likewise.
You shall not do so unto Jehovah your God; for everything that is an abomination to Jehovah which He has hated, they have done unto their gods; for they burn even their sons and daughters in the fire unto their gods.
Whatever I am commanding you, take heed to do it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.
If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,
and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have not known, and let us serve them;
you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for Jehovah your God is testing you to know whether you love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
You shall walk after Jehovah your God and fear Him, and keep His commandments and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him and cleave unto Him.
But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has spoken apostasy away from Jehovah your God, who is bringing you out of the land of Egypt and is redeeming you from the house of bondage, to thrust you out of the way in which Jehovah your God has commanded you to walk. Thus you shall put away the evil from your midst.
If your brother, the son of your mother, your son or your daughter, the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own soul, secretly entices you, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers,
of the gods of the people all around you, near to you or far off from you, from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth,
you shall not consent to him or listen to him, nor shall your eye pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him;
but you shall kill him to death; your hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
And you shall stone him with stones so that he dies, because he has sought to thrust you away from Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
Thus all Israel shall hear and fear, and not again do such wickedness as this among you.
If you hear someone in one of your cities, which Jehovah your God gives you to dwell in, saying,
Corrupt men have gone out from among you and impelled the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
then you shall inquire, search out, and ask thoroughly. And if it is indeed true and the matter is firmly established that such an abomination has been done among you,
you shall strike to kill the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword; utterly destroying it, all that is in it and its livestock, with the edge of the sword.
And you shall gather all its plunder into the middle of the open place, and completely burn with fire the city and all its plunder, before Jehovah your God. It shall always remain a heap; it shall not be built again.
And none of the accursed things shall cleave to your hand, that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of His anger and show you mercy, have compassion on you and multiply you, just as He has sworn to your fathers,
because you heeded the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep all His commandments which I am commanding you today, to do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.
You are the children of Jehovah your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
For you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God, and Jehovah has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.
You shall not eat any abominable thing.
These are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the sheep of the flock, the goat,
the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the mountain goat, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
And you may eat every animal that divides the hoof, the cleft of the hoof being cloven in two, and that brings up the cud, among the animals.
Nevertheless, you shall not eat of those that only bring up the cud, or only divide the cloven hoof: the camel, the hare, and the hyrax; for they bring up the cud but do not divide the hoof; they are unclean to you.
Also the swine is unclean to you, because it divides the hoof, yet does not bring up the cud; you shall not eat their flesh or touch their dead carcass.
These you may eat of all that are in the waters: you may eat all that have fins and scales.
And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is unclean to you.
All clean birds you may eat.
But these you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the buzzard,
the hawk, the falcon, and the kite after its kind;
every raven after its kind;
the ostrich, the great owl, the seagull, and the hawk after their kinds;
the little owl, the eared owl, the barn owl,
the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant,
the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe and the bat.
Also every swarming thing that flies is unclean to you; they shall not be eaten.
But, you may eat all clean birds.
You shall not eat anything that dies of itself; you may give it to the sojourner who is within your gates, that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people unto Jehovah your God. You shall not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
You shall give a tithe to tithe all the increase of your seed that the field yields year by year.
And you shall eat before Jehovah your God, in the place where He chooses to establish His name, the tithe of your grain and your new wine and your oil, of the firstborn of your herds and your flocks, that you may learn to fear Jehovah your God all your days.
But if the journey is too long for you, so that you are not able to carry it, or if the place where Jehovah your God chooses to put His name is too far from you, when Jehovah your God has blessed you,
then you shall exchange it for money, take the money in your hand, and go to the place which Jehovah your God shall choose.
And you shall spend that money for whatever your soul desires: for oxen or sheep, for wine or strong drink, for whatever your soul desires; you shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
You shall not forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he has no part nor inheritance with you.
At the end of every third year you shall bring out the tithe of your produce of that year and store it up within your gates.
And the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates, shall come and eat and be satisfied; that Jehovah your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release of debts.
And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor who has loaned anything to his neighbor shall let it drop; he shall not exact it of his neighbor or his brother, because it has been proclaimed the release of Jehovah.
Of a foreigner you may exact it; but whatever is with your brother, your hand shall let it drop,
that there be no one in need among you; for Jehovah will greatly bless you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance;
only if you listen to obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all these commandments which I am commanding you today.
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as He has promised you; you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow; you shall have dominion over many nations, but they shall not rule over you.
If there is among you, of your brethren within any of the gates in your land which Jehovah your God is giving you, a man who is in need, you shall not harden your heart nor shut your hand from your needy brother,
but you shall open your hand, to open unto him and lend, to lend to him sufficient for his need in whatever he is lacking.
Beware that there not be a thought in your wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, approaches; and your eye be evil against your needy brother and you give him nothing, and he cry out to Jehovah against you, and it become sin unto you.
You shall lend to give to him, and your heart shall not tremble to give to him; because for this thing Jehovah your God will bless you in all your works and in all to which you put your hand.
For the needy will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, You shall open, to open your hand unto your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.
If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.
And when you send him away free from you, you shall not send him away empty;
you shall richly adorn him from your flock, from your threshing floor, and from your winepress. From out of whatever Jehovah has blessed you, you shall give to him.
You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this thing today.
And if it happens that he says to you, I will not go out from you, because he loves you and your household, since it has been good for him with you;
then you shall take an awl and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall continue to be your servant. And to your female servant you shall do likewise.
It shall not be difficult in your eyes to let him go free from you; for he has served you six years for double the wages of a hired servant. And Jehovah your God will bless you in all that you do.
All the firstborn males that your herd and your flock bring forth you shall consecrate unto Jehovah your God; you shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.
You and your household shall eat it before Jehovah your God year by year in the place which Jehovah chooses.
But if there is a blemish in it, if it is lame or blind or has any bad blemish, you shall not sacrifice it unto Jehovah your God.
You shall eat it within your gates; the unclean and the clean alike, as a gazelle or a deer.
Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it on the ground like water.
Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover unto Jehovah your God, for in the month of Abib Jehovah your God has brought you out of Egypt by night.
You shall sacrifice the Passover unto Jehovah your God, from the flock and the herd, in the place where Jehovah chooses to establish His name.
You shall eat nothing leavened with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, the bread of affliction (for you came out of the land of Egypt in haste), that you may remember the day in which you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
And no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory for seven days, nor shall any of the flesh which you sacrifice the first day at evening remain overnight until morning.
You shall not sacrifice the Passover within just any of your gates which Jehovah your God gives you;
but at the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the appointed time that you came out of Egypt.
And you shall cook and eat it in the place which Jehovah your God chooses, and in the morning you shall turn and go to your tents.
Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a solemn assembly unto Jehovah your God. You shall do no work.
You shall count seven weeks for yourself; begin to count the seven weeks from when you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
And you shall keep the Feast of Weeks unto Jehovah your God with the portion of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give as Jehovah your God blesses you.
You shall rejoice before Jehovah your God, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, the Levite who is within your gates, the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow who are among you, at the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name.
And you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall take heed to do these statutes.
You shall observe the Feast of Booths seven days, when you have gathered from your threshing floor and from your winepress.
And you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant and the Levite, the sojourner and the fatherless and the widow, who are within your gates.
Seven days you shall keep a feast unto Jehovah your God in the place which Jehovah chooses, because Jehovah your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you shall be joyful.
Three times a year all your males shall appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He chooses: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty.
Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of Jehovah your God which He has given you.
You shall appoint judges and officers in all your gates, which Jehovah your God gives you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
You shall not pervert justice; you shall not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
Justice, only justice shall you follow, that you may live and inherit the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.
You shall not plant for yourself any tree as a grove near the altar which you build for yourself unto Jehovah your God.
You shall not set up a sacred pillar, which Jehovah your God hates.
You shall not sacrifice unto Jehovah your God a bull or sheep which has any blemish or evil thing, for that is an abomination unto Jehovah your God.
If there is found among you, within any of your gates which Jehovah your God is giving you, a man or a woman who has done evil in the eyes of Jehovah your God, in transgressing His covenant,
who has gone and served other gods and bowed down to them, either the sun or moon or any of the host of the heavens, which I have not commanded,
and it has been reported to you, and you have heard of it, and you have inquired thoroughly, and behold, it is true and the matter is certain, that such an abomination has been done in Israel;
then you shall bring out to your gates that man or woman who has done that evil thing, and shall stone that man or woman with stones until they have died.
Whoever is deserving of death shall be put to death at the mouth of two or three witnesses; he shall not be put to death at the mouth of one witness.
The hands of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.
If a matter arises which is too hard for you to judge, between blood and blood, between dispute and dispute, or between stroke and stroke, matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise and go up to the place which Jehovah your God chooses.
And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who is there in those days, and inquire; and they shall declare to you the judgment of the case.
You shall do according to the mouth of the word which they declare to you in that place which Jehovah chooses. And you shall take heed to do according to all that they instruct you.
According to the mouth of the law which they instruct you, according to the judgment which they command you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the word which they declare to you.
And the man who acts presumptuously to not heed the priest who is standing to serve there before Jehovah your God, or the judge, that man shall die. Thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.
And all the people shall hear and fear, and no longer act presumptuously.
When you come to the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, and have possessed it and dwelt in it, and say, I will set a king over me like all the nations that are around me,
you shall appoint to establish a king over you whom Jehovah your God chooses; one from among your brethren you shall set as king over you; you shall not designate a foreign man over you, who is not your brother.
And he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, for Jehovah has said to you, You shall not return that way again.
Neither shall he multiply wives for himself, that his heart not be turned aside; nor shall he greatly multiply silver and gold for himself.
It shall also be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself a copy of this Law in a book, from the one that is before the priests, the Levites.
And it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the Words of this Law and these statutes, to do them;
that his heart may not be lifted up above his brethren, that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left, and that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons in the midst of Israel.
The priests, the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the offerings of Jehovah by fire, and His portion.
Therefore they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; Jehovah is their inheritance, as He has spoken to them.
And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from those who offer a sacrifice, whether it is bull or sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach.
The firstfruits of your grain and your new wine and your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give to him.
For Jehovah your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to stand to serve in the name of Jehovah; him and his sons forever.
Thus if a Levite comes from any of your gates, from where he has been sojourning among all Israel, and comes with all the desire of his soul to the place which Jehovah chooses,
then he shall serve in the name of Jehovah his God as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand before Jehovah.
They shall eat portion like portion, besides their inheritance of the sale of their father’s estate.
When you come into the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you, you shall not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.
There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices divination, or conjuring, or fortunetelling, or sorcery,
or one who charms magic spells, or a medium, or a wizard, or one who calls up the dead.
For all who do these things are an abomination unto Jehovah, and because of these abominations Jehovah your God is dispossessing them before you.
You shall be perfect before Jehovah your God.
For these nations which you shall dispossess listened to fortunetelling and divining. But as for you, Jehovah your God has not consecrated you to such things.
Jehovah your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall hear,
according to all that you desired of Jehovah your God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God, nor let me see this great fire anymore, that I not die.
And Jehovah said to me: In that, they have spoken well.
I will raise up for them a Prophet like you from among their brethren, and will put My Words in His mouth, and He shall speak to them all that I command Him.
And it shall be that whoever will not give heed to My Words, which He speaks in My name, I will require it of him.
But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.
And if you think in your heart, How shall we know the word which Jehovah has not spoken?
when a prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah, if the thing does not happen or come to pass, that is the thing which Jehovah has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.
When Jehovah your God cuts off the nations whose land Jehovah your God is giving to you, and you have dispossessed them and dwelt in their cities and in their houses,
you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.
You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there.
And this is the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever strikes his neighbor unintentionally, not hating him in time past;
as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head has slipped from the handle and struck his neighbor so that he has died; he shall flee to one of these cities and live;
lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer and overtake him because the way is long, and kill him while his emotions are hot, though he is not deserving of death, since he had not hated his neighbor in time past.
Therefore I am commanding you, saying, You shall separate three cities for yourself.
Now if Jehovah your God enlarges your territory, as He has sworn to your fathers, and gives you the land which He has promised to give to your fathers,
and if you keep all these commandments to do them, which I am commanding you today, to love Jehovah your God and to walk always in His ways, then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three,
that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, and thus there be blood upon you.
But if anyone, while hating his neighbor, has laid in wait for him, risen against him and struck his soul so that he has died, and he has fled to one of these cities,
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
You shall not remove your neighbor’s landmark, which the men of old have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.
One witness shall not rise up against a man concerning any iniquity or any sin that he sins; at the mouth of two or three witnesses the matter shall be established.
If a false witness rises up against any man to testify against him regarding apostasy,
then both men in the controversy shall stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who hold office in those days.
And the judges shall investigate thoroughly, and indeed, if the witness is a false witness, who has testified falsely against his brother,
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother; thus you shall remove the evil from among you.
And those who remain shall hear and fear, and thereafter they shall not again commit such evil among you.
Your eye shall not pity: soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for Jehovah your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
And it shall be, when you approach the battle, that the priest shall draw near and speak to the people.
And he shall say to them, Hear, O Israel: Today you are approaching battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble nor be terrified before them;
for Jehovah your God is He who is going before you, to engage your enemies in battle, to deliver you.
And the officers shall speak to the people, saying: What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man dedicate it.
And what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man violate it.
And what man is there who has betrothed a woman and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, that he not die in battle and another man take her.
And the officers shall speak further to the people, and say, What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house, that the heart of his brethren not melt like his heart.
And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall appoint commanders of the armies at the head of the people.
When you go near a city to fight against it, then proclaim an offer of peace to it.
And it shall be that if they respond in peace and open to you, then all the people who are found in it shall be tributaries to you, and serve you.
But if the city will not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it.
And when Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword.
But the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoils, you shall plunder for yourself; and you shall eat the plunder of your enemies which Jehovah your God has given to you.
Thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive,
but you shall destroy to exterminate them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, as Jehovah your God has commanded you;
that they not teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done unto their gods, and you sin against Jehovah your God.
When you besiege a city many days, to make war against it to capture it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them, if you can eat from them; do not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, to be besieged by you?
Only the trees which you know are not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siege works against the city making war with you, until it is subdued.
If anyone is found slain, lying in the field in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who has struck him,
then your elders and your judges shall go out and measure the distance from the one slain to the surrounding cities.
And it shall be that the elders of the city nearest to the slain person shall take a heifer from the herd which has not been worked and which has not drawn with a yoke.
And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with a flowing stream, which is neither plowed nor sown, and they shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near (for Jehovah your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of Jehovah), and by their word every controversy and every stroke shall be tried.
And all the elders of that city nearest to the slain person shall wash their hands in the stream over the heifer whose neck was broken.
And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, nor have our eyes seen it.
Provide atonement, O Jehovah, for Your people Israel, whom You have redeemed, and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of Your people Israel. And the blood shall be covered.
Thus you shall put away innocent blood from among you when you do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah.
When you go out to war against your enemies, and Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand, and you have taken them captive,
and you see among the captives a woman with a beautiful figure, and desire her and would take her for your wife,
then you shall bring her home to your house, and she shall shave her head and do her nails.
She shall put off the clothes of her captivity, remain in your house, and mourn her father and her mother a month of days; after that you may go in to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
And it shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall set her free, but you certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not treat her as a slave, because you have humbled her.
If a man has two wives, one loved and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the loved and the hated, and if the firstborn son is of her who is hated,
then it shall be, on the day he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, that he shall not make the son of the loved wife the firstborn before the son of the hated, the true firstborn.
But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated wife as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and who, when they have chastened him, will not obey them,
then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his place.
And they shall say to the elders of his city, This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.
Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones; thus you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.
If a man is guilty of a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death, and you have hung him on a tree,
his corpse shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day, so that you do not defile the land which Jehovah your God is giving you as an inheritance; for he who is hanging is accursed of God.
You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep going astray, and hide yourself from them; you shall turn them back to restore them to your brother.
And if your brother is not near you, or if you do not know him, then you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall remain with you until your brother seeks for it; and you shall restore it to him.
You shall do the same with his donkey, and so shall you do with his garment; with any lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found, you shall do likewise; you cannot hide it.
You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down along the road, and hide yourself from them; you shall help him lift it up to make it stand.
A woman shall not wear anything that is fitting to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman’s garments, for all who do so are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.
If a bird’s nest happens to be before you along the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, with the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young;
you shall let the mother go free, and take the young for yourself, that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.
When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing for your roof, that you may not bring blood upon your house if anyone falls from it.
You shall not sow your vineyard with different kinds of seed, that the yield of the seed which you have sown and the fruit of your vineyard not be defiled.
You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
You shall not wear a garment of mixed fabric, such as wool and linen together.
You shall make tassels on the four corners of the clothing with which you cover yourself.
If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,
and charges her with wantonness, and brings a bad name upon her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin;
then the father and mother of the young woman shall take and bring out the evidence of the young woman’s virginity to the elders of the city at the gate.
And the young woman’s father shall say to the elders, I have given my daughter to this man as wife, and he hates her.
And behold, he has charged her with wantonness, saying, I have found your daughter to not be a virgin, and yet these are the evidences of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name on a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he cannot put her away all his days.
But if the thing is true, and evidence of virginity is not found for the young woman,
then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to commit harlotry in her father’s house. Thus you shall put away the evil from among you.
If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die; the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; thus you shall put away the evil from Israel.
If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a man, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her,
then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.
But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die.
But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;
for he had found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman had cried out, but there was no one to deliver her.
If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out,
then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he cannot put her away all his days.
A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor uncover his father’s skirt.
He who is wounded by crushing or had his male organ cut off shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah.
One of illegitimate birth shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation none of his shall enter the assembly of Jehovah.
An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the assembly of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation none of them shall enter the assembly of Jehovah, perpetually;
because they did not meet you with bread and water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.
Nevertheless Jehovah your God would not listen to Balaam, but Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because Jehovah your God has loved you.
You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days, perpetually.
You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a sojourner in his land.
The children of the third generation born to them may enter the assembly of Jehovah.
When the army goes out against your enemies, then keep yourself from every evil thing.
If there is any man among you who becomes unclean by accident in the night, then he shall go outside the camp; he shall not come inside the camp.
But it shall be, when evening comes, that he shall wash with water; and when the sun sets, he shall come into the camp.
Also you shall have a place outside the camp, where you may go out;
and you shall have a spade among your tools, and when you sit outside, you shall dig with it and turn over and cover your excrement.
For Jehovah your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you and give up your enemies before you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that He may see no unclean thing among you, and turn away from you.
You shall not deliver up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you.
He shall dwell with you in your midst, in the place which he chooses within one of your gates, where it is agreeable to him; you shall not oppress him.
There shall be no female temple prostitute of the daughters of Israel, nor a male temple prostitute of the sons of Israel.
You shall not bring the wages of prostitution or the price of a dog into the house of Jehovah your God for any vow, for both of these are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.
You shall not charge interest to your brother; interest on money or food or anything that is loaned at interest.
To a foreigner you may charge interest, but to your brother you shall not charge interest, that Jehovah your God may bless you in all to which you put your hand in the land which you are entering to possess.
When you vow a vow unto Jehovah your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for Jehovah your God will seek to require it of you, and it would be sin in you.
But if you abstain from vowing, it shall not be sin in you.
That which has gone forth from your lips you shall keep and do; that which you have voluntarily vowed unto Jehovah your God, what you have promised with your mouth.
When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes at your pleasure, but you shall not put any in your vessel.
When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, you may pluck the heads with your hand, but you shall not swing a sickle into your neighbor’s standing grain.
When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some uncleanness in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house,
if she has departed from his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife,
if the latter husband hates her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband who took her as his wife dies,
then her former husband who sent her away cannot take her back to be his wife after she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before Jehovah, and you shall not bring sin upon the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance.
When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war nor leave for any business; he shall be free at home one year, and bring gladness to his wife whom he has taken.
No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone in pledge, for he takes one’s soul in pledge.
If a man is found kidnapping any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and has treated him as a slave or sold him, then that kidnapper shall die; thus you shall put away the evil from among you.
Take heed regarding the plague of leprosy, that you take great heed to do according to all that the priests, the Levites, shall teach you; as I have commanded them, thus you shall take heed to do.
Remember what Jehovah your God did to Miriam on the way when you came out of Egypt.
When you lend your brother anything, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.
You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge out to you.
And if the man is poor, you shall not sleep with his pledge.
You shall return and bring the pledge back to him when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his own garment and bless you; and it shall be righteousness in you before Jehovah your God.
You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether one of your brethren or one of the sojourners who is in your land within your gates.
Each day you shall give him his wages, and not let the sun go down on it, for he is poor and is sustaining his soul with it; lest he cry out against you unto Jehovah, and it be sin in you.
Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
You shall not pervert justice due the sojourner or the fatherless, nor take a widow’s garment as a pledge.
But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Jehovah your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.
When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow; and Jehovah your God shall bless you in all the work of your hands.
When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.
When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow.
And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.
If there is a dispute between men, and they come to court, that the judges may judge them, and they justify the righteous and condemn the wicked,
then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie prostrate and be beaten in his presence, according to his guilt, by number.
He may beat him forty times and no more, lest he should exceed this and beat him with many stripes above these, and your brother be degraded in your eyes.
You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.
If brothers dwell together, and one of them dies and has no son, the widow of the dead man shall not be married to a strange man outside the family; her husband’s brother shall go in to her, take her as his wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her.
And it shall be that the firstborn son which she bears shall succeed to the name of his dead brother, that his name not be blotted out of Israel.
But if the man does not desire to take his brother’s wife, then his brother’s wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husband’s brother refuses to raise up a name to his brother in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.
If after the elders of his city have summoned him and spoken to him, he has stood firm and said, I do not desire to take her,
then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, spit in his face, and answer and say, So shall it be done to the man who will not build up the house of his brother.
And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who had his sandal removed.
If two men strive with one another, and the wife of one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of the one striking him, and puts out her hand and grabs him by the genitals,
then you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not pity.
You shall not have in your bag a stone and a stone weight, a great and small.
You shall not have in your house an ephah and ephah, a large and small.
You shall have perfect and just weight stones, a perfect and just ephah; that your days may be prolonged in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.
For all who do such things, all who do unrighteously, are an abomination unto Jehovah your God.
Remember what Amalek did to you on the way as you were coming forth out of Egypt,
how he met you on the way and attacked your rear, all the feeble ones following at the rear, when you were exhausted and weary; and he did not fear God.
Therefore it shall be, when Jehovah your God has given you rest from your enemies all around, in the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, that you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens. You shall not forget.
And it shall be, when you come into the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you as an inheritance, and you have possessed it and dwelt in it,
that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground, which you shall bring from your land that Jehovah your God is giving to you, and put it in a basket and go to the place where Jehovah your God chooses to establish His name.
And you shall go to the one who is priest in those days, and say to him, I declare today unto Jehovah your God that I have come to the land which Jehovah has sworn to our fathers to give to us.
And the priest shall take the basket out of your hand and set it down before the altar of Jehovah your God.
And you shall answer and say before Jehovah your God: My father was an Aramean, about to perish, and he went down to Egypt and sojourned there, few in number; and there he became a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
And the Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and laid cruel labor upon us.
And we cried out unto Jehovah the God of our fathers, and Jehovah heard our voice and looked upon our affliction and our labor and our oppression.
And Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders.
And He has brought us to this place and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;
and now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land which you, O Jehovah, have given me. And you shall set it before Jehovah your God, and bow down before Jehovah your God.
And you shall rejoice in every good thing which Jehovah your God has given to you and your house, you and the Levite and the sojourner who is among you.
When you have finished tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year; the year of tithing; and have given it to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat within your gates and be filled,
then you shall say before Jehovah your God: I have removed the holy things from my house, and also have given them to the Levite, the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, according to all Your commandments which You have commanded me; I have not transgressed Your commandments, nor have I forgotten them.
I have not eaten any of it when in mourning, nor have I removed any of it for an unclean use, nor given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah my God, and have done according to all that You have commanded me.
Look down from Your holy habitation, from Heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land which You have given to us, as You have sworn to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to do these statutes and judgments; therefore you shall take heed to do them with all your heart and with all your soul.
Today you have declared Jehovah to be your God, and to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, His commandments, and His judgments, and to obey His voice.
And today Jehovah has declared you to be His treasured people, as He has promised you; for you to keep all His commandments,
and to make you high above all nations which He has made, in praise, in name, and in honor, and that you may be a holy people unto Jehovah your God, as He has spoken.
And Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people, saying: Keep all the commandments which I am commanding you today.
And it shall be, on the day when you cross over the Jordan to the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, that you shall set up for yourselves large stones, and whitewash them with lime.
And you shall write on them all the Words of this Law, when you have crossed over, that you may enter the land which Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah the God of your fathers has promised you.
Therefore it shall be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that on Mount Ebal you shall set up these stones, which I am commanding you today, and you shall whitewash them with lime.
And there you shall build an altar unto Jehovah your God, an altar of stones; you shall not use an iron tool on them.
You shall build with whole stones the altar of Jehovah your God, and offer burnt offerings on it unto Jehovah your God.
You shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before Jehovah your God.
And you shall write very plainly on the stones all the Words of this Law.
And Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying, Be silent and listen, O Israel: This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God.
Therefore you shall obey the voice of Jehovah your God, and do His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today.
And Moses charged the people on the same day, saying,
These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin;
and these shall stand on Mount Ebal to curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
And the Levites shall speak with a loud voice and say to all the men of Israel:
Cursed is the one who makes a graven or molten image, an abomination to Jehovah, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor’s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who makes the blind to wander off the road. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who perverts the justice due the sojourner, the fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who lies with any kind of animal. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who strikes his neighbor secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to strike the blood of an innocent soul. And all the people shall say, Amen!
Cursed is the one who does not confirm all the Words of this Law. And all the people shall say, Amen!
And it shall come to pass, if you take heed to obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all His commandments which I am commanding you today, that Jehovah your God will set you high above all nations of the earth.
And all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of Jehovah your God:
Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the field.
Blessed shall be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your livestock, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flocks.
Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out.
Jehovah shall cause your enemies who rise against you to be stricken before your face; they shall come out against you one way and flee before you seven ways.
Jehovah shall command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you put your hand, and He will bless you in the land which Jehovah your God is giving to you.
Jehovah will establish you as a holy people unto Himself, as He has sworn unto you, if you keep the commandments of Jehovah your God and have walked in His ways.
And all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of Jehovah, and they shall be afraid of you.
And Jehovah will make you exceed in prosperity, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, in the land of which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers to give to you.
Jehovah will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow.
And Jehovah will make you the head and not the tail; you shall be above only, and not be beneath, if you heed the commandments of Jehovah your God, which I am commanding you today, and take heed to do them.
And you shall not turn aside from any of the words which I am commanding you this day, to the right or the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
But it shall come to pass, if you do not obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to take heed to do all His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today, that all these curses shall come upon you and overtake you:
Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.
Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, the offspring of your cattle and the increase of your flocks.
Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
Jehovah will send upon you cursing, turmoil, and rebuke in all that you set your hand to do, until you are destroyed and until you perish quickly, because of the evil of your doings in which you have forsaken Me.
Jehovah will make the plague cling to you until He has consumed you from off the land which you are going in to possess.
Jehovah will strike you with consumption, with fever, with inflammation, with burning fever, with the sword, with blight, and with mildew; they shall pursue you until you perish.
And your heavens over your head shall be bronze, and the earth under you shall be iron.
Jehovah will make the rain of your land into dust and powder; from the heavens it shall come down upon you until you are destroyed.
Jehovah will cause you to be stricken before your enemies; you shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them; and you shall be an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
Your carcasses shall be food for all the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth, and no one shall frighten them away.
Jehovah will strike you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors, with the scab, and with the itch, from which you cannot be healed.
Jehovah will strike you with madness and blindness and bewilderment of heart.
And you shall grope at noonday, as a blind man gropes in darkness; you shall not prosper in your ways; you shall be only oppressed and plundered all your days, and no one shall deliver you.
You shall betroth a wife, but another man shall lie with her; you shall build a house, but you shall not dwell in it; you shall plant a vineyard, but shall not begin to eat.
Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it; your donkey shall be violently taken away from before you, and shall not be restored to you; your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall have no one to rescue them.
Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.
A nation whom you have not known shall eat the fruit of your land and your produce, and you shall be only oppressed and crushed continually.
Thus you shall be driven mad because of the sight which your eyes see.
Jehovah will strike you in the knees and on the legs with severe boils which cannot be healed, and from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.
Jehovah will bring you and the king whom you set over you to a nation which neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods; wood and stone.
And you shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all the nations where Jehovah shall drive you.
You shall carry much seed out to the field but gather little in, for the locust shall consume it.
You shall plant vineyards and tend them, but you shall neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.
You shall have olive trees throughout all your territory, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off.
You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity.
Locusts shall dispossess all your trees and the produce of your land.
The sojourners among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower.
He shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him; he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
Moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you, until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He has commanded you.
And they shall be upon you for a sign and a wonder, and upon your seed perpetually.
Because you did not serve Jehovah your God with joy and gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things,
therefore you shall serve your enemies, whom Jehovah will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in need of everything; and He will put a yoke of iron upon your neck until He has destroyed you.
Jehovah will bring a nation against you from afar, from the ends of the earth, as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand,
a nation of fierce countenance, which does not regard the face of the old nor show favor to the young.
And they shall eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your land, until you are destroyed; they shall not leave you grain or new wine or oil, or the offspring of your cattle or the increase of your flocks, until they have destroyed you.
They shall besiege you at all your gates until your high and fortified walls, in which you trust, come down throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which Jehovah your God has given to you.
You shall eat the fruit of your own womb, the flesh of your sons and your daughters whom Jehovah your God has given to you, in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemies shall distress you.
The eye of the man who is tender and very delicate shall quiver with hostility toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the rest of his children whom he leaves behind,
so that he will not give to any of them the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.
The eye of the tender and dainty woman among you, who would not have ventured to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and tenderness, will quiver with hostility toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son and her daughter,
and toward her afterbirth which comes forth from between her feet and her children whom she bears; for she shall eat them secretly for lack of everything in the siege and desperate straits in which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates.
If you do not take heed to do all the Words of this Law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and awesome name, JEHOVAH GOD,
then Jehovah will bring upon you and your seed extraordinary plagues; great and long lasting plagues; and evil long lasting sicknesses.
Moreover He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt, of which you were afraid, and they shall cleave to you.
Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in this Book of the Law, will Jehovah bring upon you to destroy you.
You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars of heaven in multitude, because you would not obey the voice of Jehovah your God.
And it shall be, that just as Jehovah has rejoiced over you to do you good and multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to destroy you and annihilate you; and you shall be torn away from off the land which you are going in to possess.
And Jehovah will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known; wood and stone.
And among those nations you shall find no rest, nor shall the sole of your foot have a resting place; but there Jehovah shall give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and fainting soul.
Your life shall hang in doubt before you; you shall fear day and night, and have no assurance of life.
In the morning you shall say, Oh, that it were evening! And at evening you shall say, Oh, that it were morning! because of the fear which terrifies your heart, and because of the sight which your eyes see.
And Jehovah will take you back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I had said to you, You shall never see it again. And there you shall have been sold to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
These are the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them in Horeb.
And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that Jehovah has done before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land;
the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders.
Yet Jehovah has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this very day.
And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.
You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.
And when you came to this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we struck them.
We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
Therefore keep the Words of this covenant, and do them, that you may be wise in all that you do.
All of you are standing today before Jehovah your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officials, all the men of Israel;
your little ones and your wives; and the sojourner who is in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;
to enter into the covenant with Jehovah your God, and into His oath, which Jehovah your God is making with you today,
to establish you today as a people for Himself, to be, Himself, your God, just as He has spoken to you, and as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
I am making this covenant and this oath, not only with you,
but with him who stands here with us today before Jehovah our God, as well as with him who is not here with us today
(for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by,
and you saw their abominations and their idols among them of wood and stone and silver and gold);
so that there not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from Jehovah our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations, and that there not be among you a root bearing venom or bitterness;
and so it not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he has blessed himself in his heart, thinking, I shall have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart; and thus to snatch away the watered with the thirsty.
Jehovah will not consent to forgive him; for then the anger of Jehovah and His jealousy shall smoke against that man, and every curse that is written in this book shall lie down upon him, and Jehovah shall blot out his name from under the heavens.
And Jehovah shall separate him from all the tribes of Israel for evil, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law,
so that your children of the generations to come, who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which Jehovah has laid upon it, shall utter:
The whole land is brimstone, salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it sprout, nor does any grass grow there, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in His anger and His wrath.
And all the nations shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus unto this land? What is the meaning of this great burning anger?
Then people shall say: Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which He had made with them to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
for they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that He had not apportioned to them.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against this land, to bring upon it every curse that is written in this Book.
And Jehovah uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.
Jehovah our God hides Himself; but reveals Himself to us and to our children forever, to do all the Words of this Law.
And it shall come to pass, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where Jehovah your God has thrust you away,
and you return to Jehovah your God and obey His voice, according to all that I am commanding you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul,
that Jehovah your God will bring you back from captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations where Jehovah your God has scattered you.
If you are thrust out to the ends of the heavens, from there Jehovah your God will gather you, and from there He will fetch you.
And Jehovah your God will bring you into the land which your fathers had possessed and you had possessed. He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.
And Jehovah your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed, to love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live.
And Jehovah your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and upon those who were hating you, who had persecuted you.
And you shall return and obey the voice of Jehovah and do all His commandments which I am commanding you today.
Jehovah your God will make you abound in every work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb, in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your land for good. For Jehovah will again rejoice over you for good, as He has rejoiced over your fathers,
if you obey the voice of Jehovah your God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
For this commandment which I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you to understand, nor is it far off.
It is not in the heavens, for you to think: Who shall ascend into the heavens for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?
Nor is it beyond the sea, for you to think: Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?
But the Word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.
Behold, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil;
in that I am commanding you today to love Jehovah your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and Jehovah your God will bless you in the land which you are going in to possess.
But if your heart turns away so that you will not obey, and have drawn away, and bowed down to other gods and served them,
I have declared to you today that you shall be exterminated to perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land which you are crossing over the Jordan to go in and possess.
I call Heaven and earth to bear witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live;
to love Jehovah your God, to obey His voice, and to cleave unto Him, for He is your life and the length of your days; to dwell in the land which Jehovah has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them.
And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
And he said to them: I am one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer go out and come in. And Jehovah has said to me, You shall not cross over this Jordan.
Jehovah your God Himself is crossing over before you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua himself is crossing over before you, as Jehovah has spoken.
And Jehovah will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them.
Jehovah will give them up before you, to do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for Jehovah your God, He is the One who is going with you. He will not abandon you nor forsake you.
And Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the eyes of all Israel, Be strong and of good courage, for you shall go with this people into the land which Jehovah has sworn to their fathers to give to them, and you shall cause them to inherit it.
And Jehovah, He is going before you. He will be with you; He will not abandon you nor forsake you. Do not fear nor be dismayed.
And Moses wrote this Law and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and to all the elders of Israel.
And Moses commanded them, saying: At the end of every seven years, at the appointed time in the year of release, at the Feast of Booths,
when all Israel comes to appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this Law before all Israel in their ears.
Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the sojourner who is within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear Jehovah your God and take heed to do all the Words of this Law,
and that their children, who have not known it, may hear and learn to fear Jehovah your God all the days you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
And Jehovah said to Moses, Behold, the day has drawn near for you to die. Summon Joshua, and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, that I may commission him. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.
And Jehovah appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tent.
And Jehovah said to Moses: Behold, you shall rest with your fathers; and this people will rise up and commit adultery with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they are going in to be among them, and they will forsake Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
And My anger will burn against them in that day, and I shall forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
And I will conceal to hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.
Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for Me against the children of Israel.
When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I have sworn to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves and grown fat, then they will have turned to other gods and served them; and they will have provoked Me and broken My covenant.
And it shall be, when many evils and troubles find them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their seed, for I know the imagination of their works even today, even before I bring them into the land of which I have sworn to give to them.
Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
And He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I have sworn to them, and I shall be with you.
So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this Law in a book, when they were finished,
that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, saying:
Take this Book of the Law, and put it inside the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, to be there as a witness against you;
for I know your rebellion and your stiff neck. If today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against Jehovah, then how much more after my death?
Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears and call Heaven and earth to testify against them.
For I know that after my death you will pervert yourselves to corruption, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.
And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song to their conclusion:
Give ear, O Heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
Let my teaching drop as the rain, my speech distill as the dew, as raindrops on the tender herb, and as showers upon the grass.
For I proclaim the name of Jehovah; ascribe greatness to our God.
He is the Rock, His work is perfect; for all His ways are justice, a Mighty God of truth and without injustice; righteous and upright is He.
They have corrupted themselves; they are not His children, because of their blemish: a perverse and crooked generation.
Do you deal thus with Jehovah, O foolish and unwise people? Is He not your Father, who bought you? Has He not made you and established you?
Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will say to you:
When the Most High divided their inheritance to the nations, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
For Jehovah’s portion is His people; Jacob is the allotment of His inheritance.
He found him in a desert land and in the wasteland, a howling wilderness; He encircled him, He instructed him, He kept him as the pupil of His eye.
As an eagle stirs up its nest, hovers over its young, spreading out its wings, taking them up, carrying them on its wings,
so Jehovah alone led him, and there was no foreign god with him.
He made him ride in the heights of the earth, that he might eat the produce of the fields; He made him suck honey from the rock, and oil from the rock of flint;
butter from the cattle, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs; and rams of the sons of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.
But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; you grew fat, you grew thick, you are gorged! And he forsook the God who had made him, and treated with contempt the Rock of his salvation.
They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked Him to anger.
They sacrificed to demons, not to God, to gods they had not known, to new gods come lately, that your fathers had not feared.
Of the Rock who begot you, you are unmindful, and have forgotten the Mighty God who brought you forth.
And when Jehovah saw it, He spurned them, because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.
And He said, I will hide My face from them, I will see what their end will be, for they are a perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.
They have provoked Me to jealousy by what is not the Mighty God; they have moved Me to anger by their vanities. So I will provoke them to jealousy by those who are not a people; I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.
For a fire has been kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest Sheol; it shall consume the earth with her produce, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
I will heap evil upon them; I will use up My arrows upon them.
They shall be wasted with hunger, devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction; I will also send against them the teeth of beasts, with the poison of the serpents of the dust.
The sword from outside, and the terror from within, shall bereave the young man and virgin, the nursing child and the man of gray hairs.
I have said, I will dash them in pieces, I will bring to an end the memory of them from among men,
had I not feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should misunderstand, lest they should say, our hand is high; and Jehovah has not done all this.
For they are a nation void of counsel, nor is there any understanding in them.
Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Jehovah had delivered them up?
For their rock is not like our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.
Their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of vipers.
Is this not laid up in store with Me, sealed up among My treasures?
Vengeance is Mine, and recompense; their foot shall slip in due time; for the day of their calamity is near, and the things prepared have made haste upon them.
For Jehovah will judge His people and have compassion on His servants, when He sees that their power is gone, and there is no one remaining, bond or free.
He will say, Where are their gods, the rock in which they sought refuge?
Who ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you, and be your refuge.
See now that I, even I, am He, and there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; nor is there any who can deliver out of My hand.
For I raise My hand to the heavens, and say, As I live forever,
if I whet My glittering sword, and My hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to My enemies, and repay those who hate Me.
I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the heads of the commanders of the enemy.
Rejoice, O nations, with His people; for He will avenge the blood of His servants, and render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land and His people.
And Moses came with Joshua the son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people.
And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel,
and He said to them: Set your hearts on all the words which I am testifying against you today, that you command your children to take heed to do all the Words of this Law.
For these are not empty words to you, for it is your life; and by this Word you shall prolong your days in the land where you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.
And Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day, saying:
Go up into this mountain of Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, across from Jericho; view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel as a possession;
and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, even as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people;
because you have trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not honor Me in the midst of the children of Israel.
Yet you shall see the land before you, though you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.
Now this is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
And he said: Jehovah has come from Sinai, and dawned on them from Seir; He has shone forth from Mount Paran, and He has come with ten thousands of saints; from His right hand a fiery Law for them.
Yes, He loves the people; all His saints are in Your hand; they sit down at Your feet; everyone receives Your Words.
Moses has commanded a Law for us, a heritage for the congregation of Jacob.
And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.
Let Reuben live, and not die, and let his men be numbered.
And this he said of Judah: Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people; let his hands be sufficient for him, and may You be a help against his enemies.
And of Levi he said: Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your Godly man, whom You tested at Massah, and with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;
who says of his father and mother, I have not seen them; nor has he acknowledged his brothers, or known his own children; for they have kept Your Word and guarded Your covenant.
They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, and Israel Your Law. They shall put incense before Your nose, and a whole burnt offering upon Your altar.
Bless his strength, O Jehovah, and accept the work of his hands; strike the loins of those who rise against him, and of those who hate him, that they rise not again.
Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of Jehovah shall dwell in safety by Him, who shelters him all the day long; and he shall dwell between His shoulders.
And of Joseph he said: Blessed of Jehovah is his land, with the excellence of the heavens, with the dew, and the deep lying beneath,
with the excellent yield of the sun, with the excellent produce of the months,
with the chief things of the ancient mountains, with the excellence of the enduring hills,
with the excellence of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of Him who dwelt in the bush; let it come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.
His glory is like a firstborn bull, and his horns like the horns of the oryx; together with them He shall thrust the peoples to the ends of the earth; they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and Issachar in your tents!
They shall call the peoples to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hidden in the sand.
And of Gad he said: Blessed is he who enlarges Gad; he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm and the crown of the head.
He saw the first part for himself, because a lawgiver’s portion was reserved there. He came with the heads of the people; he has administered the justice of Jehovah, and His judgments with Israel.
And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion’s whelp; he shall leap from Bashan.
And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of Jehovah, possess the west and the south.
And of Asher he said: Asher is most blessed of sons; let him be acceptable to his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.
Your sandals shall be iron and bronze; as your days, so your strength.
There is no one like the Mighty God of Jeshurun, riding the Heavens for your help, and in His majesty upon the clouds.
The God of old is your refuge, and underneath are the eternal arms. He will thrust out the enemy before you, and say, Destroy!
And Israel shall dwell alone in safety, the fountain of Jacob in a land of grain and new wine; his heavens shall also drop dew.
Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by Jehovah, the shield of your help and the sword of your majesty! Your enemies shall cower before you, and you shall tread down their high places.
And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And Jehovah showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan,
all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western Sea,
the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.
And Jehovah said to him, This is the land of which I have sworn to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed. I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.
So Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab, according to the mouth of Jehovah.
And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but no one knows his grave to this day.
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eyes had not dimmed nor had his natural vigor abated.
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. And the days of weeping and mourning for Moses ended.
And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the Spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face,
in all the signs and wonders which Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land,
and by all the mighty hand and all the great terror which Moses had done in the eyes of all Israel.
And after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah, it came to pass that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying:
Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them; to the children of Israel.
Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon I have given to you, as I have said to Moses.
From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory.
No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not abandon you nor forsake you.
Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I have sworn to their fathers to give to them.
Only be strong and very courageous, that you may take heed to do according to all the Law which Moses My servant has commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go.
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may take heed to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.
Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions for yourselves, for within three days you are crossing over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God is giving you to possess.
And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying,
Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God is giving you rest and has given you this land.
Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses has given you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them,
until Jehovah has given your brethren rest, as He has given you, and they also have taken possession of the land which Jehovah your God is giving to them. Then you shall return to possess the land of your inheritance, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.
So they answered Joshua, saying, All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
Just as we have heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only Jehovah your God be with you, as He was with Moses.
Whoever rebels against your mouth and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men from Shittim to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, especially Jericho. So they went, and came to the house of a harlot woman named Rahab, and lodged there.
And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the land.
And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the land.
And the woman took the two men and hid them; and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men departed. Where the men have gone I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.
(But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.)
And the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
And before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,
and said to the men: I know that Jehovah has given you the land, that the terror of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted before you.
For we have heard how Jehovah dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
And as soon as we heard these things, our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for Jehovah your God, He is God in the heavens above and on earth beneath.
Now therefore, I beg you, swear to me by Jehovah, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father’s house, and give me a true token,
and save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our souls from death.
And the men answered her, Our lives for yours, if you tell none of this business of ours. And it shall be, when Jehovah gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.
Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was on the side of the wall; she dwelt in the wall.
And she said to them, Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers return; and afterward you may go your way.
And the men said to her: We will be exempt from this oath of yours which you have made us swear,
unless, when we come into the land, you bind this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you have let us down; and you shall bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household into your house.
And it shall be that whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head if a hand is laid on him.
And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you have made us swear.
And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.
They departed and went into the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but did not find them.
So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and recounted to him all that happened to them.
And they said to Joshua, Truly Jehovah has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the land have melted before us.
And Joshua arose early in the morning; and they set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before crossing over.
So it was, after three days, that the officers went through the camp;
and they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God, and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it.
Yet there shall be a distance between you and it of about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed this way before.
And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow Jehovah will do wonders among you.
And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify you in the eyes of all Israel, and they shall know that, as I was with Moses, so I am with you.
And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, you shall remain standing in the Jordan.
And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of Jehovah your God.
And Joshua said, By this you shall know that the living Mighty God is among you, and that He will destroy to dispossess before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites:
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan.
Now therefore, take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.
And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they shall stand in a heap.
So it was, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the whole time of harvest),
that the waters which came down from upstream stood still, and rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that is beside Zaretan. Thus the waters that went down into the sea of the plain, the Salt Sea, stopped, and were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.
And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over the Jordan, that Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying:
Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe,
and command them, saying, Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you lodge tonight.
Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from each tribe;
and Joshua said to them: Cross over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, What are these stones to you?
Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for all time.
And the children of Israel did so, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, at the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
Thus, the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over.
And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the ark of Jehovah and the priests crossed over before the people.
And the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them.
About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before Jehovah for battle, to the plains of Jericho.
On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the eyes of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.
And Jehovah spoke to Joshua, saying,
Command the priests who bear the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.
Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come up out of the Jordan.
And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks as before.
Now the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they camped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.
And the twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.
And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: When your sons ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What are these stones?
then you shall let your children know, saying, Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land;
for Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as Jehovah your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over,
that all the peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah, that it is mighty, that you may fear Jehovah your God all your days.
So it was, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of Israel until we had crossed over, that their heart melted; and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the children of Israel.
At that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make flint knives for yourself, and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.
And Joshua made flint knives for himself, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, after they had come out of Egypt.
For all the people who came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness, on the way as they came out of Egypt, had not been circumcised.
For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people who were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not obey the voice of Jehovah; to whom Jehovah swore that He would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn to their fathers that He would give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
And Joshua circumcised their sons whom He raised up in their place; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.
So it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp to be healed.
And Jehovah said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. Therefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
And the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening on the wilderness plains of Jericho.
And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and roasted grain, on the very same day.
And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are You for us or for our adversaries?
And He said, No, but as Commander of the army of Jehovah I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and prostrated himself, and said to Him, What does my Lord speak to His servant?
And the Commander of the army of Jehovah said to Joshua, Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you are standing is holy. And Joshua did so.
Now Jericho was closed, shut up before the children of Israel; no one going out, and no one coming in.
And Jehovah said to Joshua: Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand, its king, and the mighty men of valor.
You shall go around the city, all the men of war; you shall go all around the city once. Thus you shall do six days.
And seven priests shall bear seven shofars of rams’ horns before the ark. And the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the shofars.
And it shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the shofar, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.
And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven shofars of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah.
And he said to the people, Pass along, and go around the city, and let him who is armed go along before the ark of Jehovah.
So it was, when Joshua spoke to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven shofars of rams’ horns before Jehovah went along and blew the shofars, with the ark of the covenant of Jehovah following behind.
The armed men went before the priests who blew the shofars, with the rear guard coming along behind the ark, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.
And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, You shall not shout or cause your voice to be heard, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, Shout! Then you shall shout.
So the ark of Jehovah went around the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp and lodged in the camp.
And Joshua arose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of Jehovah.
And seven priests bearing seven shofars of rams’ horns before the ark of Jehovah proceeded to walk and blew with the shofars. And the armed men went before them, the rear guard coming behind the ark of Jehovah, while they proceeded blowing the shofars.
And the second day they went around the city once and returned to the camp. Thus they did six days.
But it came to pass on the seventh day that they arose early, about the dawning of the day, and went around the city seven times in the same manner. Only, on that day they went around the city seven times.
And the seventh time it happened, when the priests had blown the shofars, that Joshua said to the people: Shout! For Jehovah has given you the city!
And the city shall be devoted unto Jehovah, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we had sent.
And you shall altogether keep from the devoted things, that you not be accursed when you take of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
And all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are holy unto Jehovah; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah.
So the people shouted when the priests blew the shofars. And it happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofars and the people shouting with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. And the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they captured the city.
And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.
And Joshua had said to the two men who had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house, and from there bring out the woman and all that she has, as you have sworn to her.
And the young men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had. And they brought out all her family and set them outside the camp of Israel.
And they burned the city and all that was in it with fire. Only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah.
And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot, her father’s house, and all that she had. And she dwells in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.
And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before Jehovah who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay its foundation with his firstborn, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.
Thus Jehovah was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the land.
But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the devoted things, for Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted things; so the anger of Jehovah burned against the children of Israel.
Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is next to Beth Aven, to the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people toil there, for they are few.
So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai.
And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
And Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Jehovah until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they threw dust on their heads.
And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all; to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!
O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies?
For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear it, and surround us, and cut off our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?
And Jehovah said to Joshua: Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face?
Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I have commanded them. For they have even taken some of the devoted things, and have both stolen and deceived; and they have also put it among their own stuff.
Therefore the sons of Israel were not able to stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they are accursed. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you.
Get up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: There is a devoted thing in your midst, O Israel; you are not able to stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted thing from among you.
In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which Jehovah takes shall come according to families; and the family which Jehovah takes shall come by households; and the household which Jehovah takes shall come man by man.
And it shall be that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of Jehovah, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.
So Joshua arose early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
He brought near the family of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought near the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
And he brought near his house man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to Jehovah the God of Israel, and make confession to Him, and please tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me.
And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel, and this is what I have done:
When I saw among the spoils a beautiful garment from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.
So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the silver under it.
And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before Jehovah.
And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
And Joshua said, Why have you troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble you this day! And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.
And they raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. And Jehovah turned back from His burning anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.
And Jehovah said to Joshua: Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king. Only its spoils and its cattle you shall take as plunder for yourselves. Lay an ambush for the city behind it.
So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor and sent them away by night.
And he commanded them, saying: Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind the city. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.
And I and all the people with me shall approach the city; and it shall come about, when they come out against us as at the first, that we shall flee before them.
For they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city, for they will think, They are fleeing before us as at the first. Therefore we will flee before them.
Then you shall rise up from the ambush and seize the city, for Jehovah your God has delivered it into your hand.
And it shall be, when you have taken the city, that you shall set the city on fire. According to the word of Jehovah you shall do. See, I have commanded you.
Joshua therefore sent them out; and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night among the people.
And Joshua rose up early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
And all the people of war who were with him went up and drew near; and they came before the city and camped on the north side of Ai. Now a valley lay between them and Ai.
So he took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
And when they had set the people, all the army that was on the north of the city, and its rear guard on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
And it happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that the men of the city hurried and arose early and went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place before the plain. But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by way of the wilderness.
So all the people of Ai were assembled to pursue them. And they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.
There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. So they left the city open and pursued Israel.
And Jehovah said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand. And Joshua stretched out the javelin in his hand toward the city.
And those in ambush rose up quickly out of their place; they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand, and they entered the city and took it, and hurried to set the city on fire.
And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to the heavens. So they had no strength to flee this way or that way, and the people who had fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai.
And the others came out of the city against them; so they were caught in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side. And they struck them down, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness where they pursued them, and when they all had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.
And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand; all the people of Ai.
For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
Only the livestock and the spoils of that city Israel took as plunder for themselves, according to the word of Jehovah which He had commanded Joshua.
And Joshua burned Ai and made it a perpetual heap, a desolation to this day.
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening. And as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded and they took his corpse down from the tree, cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raise over it a great heap of stones that remains to this day.
And Joshua built an altar unto Jehovah the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,
as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: an altar of whole stones on which no man has wielded an iron tool. And they offered upon it burnt offerings unto Jehovah, and sacrificed peace offerings.
And there, in the presence of the children of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which he had written.
And all Israel, with their elders and officers and judges, stood on either side of the ark before the priests, the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, the sojourner as well as he who was born among them. Half of them were in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
And afterward he read all the Words of the Law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law.
There was not a Word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, with the women, the little ones, and the sojourners who were living among them.
And it came to pass when all the kings who were by the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of the Great Sea toward Lebanon; the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; heard about it,
that they gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one mouth.
But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
they did shrewdly, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and bound up,
old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry and in crumbs.
And they went to Joshua, to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, We have come from a distant land; now therefore, make a treaty with us.
And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Perhaps you are dwelling among us; so how can we make a treaty with you?
But they said to Joshua, We are your servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are you, and where do you come from?
So they said to him: Your servants have come from a very distant land, because of the name of Jehovah your God; for we have heard of His fame, and all that He has done in Egypt,
and all that He has done to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan; to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants; now therefore, make a treaty with us.
This bread of ours we took hot for our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now behold, it is dry and crumbly.
And these wineskins which we filled were new, and behold, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.
And the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask at the mouth of Jehovah.
And Joshua made peace with them, and made a treaty with them to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made the treaty with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, dwelling among them.
And the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim.
But the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel. And all the congregation grumbled against the leaders.
Then all the leaders said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Jehovah the God of Israel; now therefore, we cannot touch them.
This we will do to them: We will let them live, that wrath not be upon us because of the oath which we have sworn to them.
And the leaders said to them, Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders have spoken to them.
And Joshua summoned them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you, when you are dwelling among us?
Now therefore, you are cursed, and none of you shall fail to be slaves, woodcutters and drawers of water for the house of my God.
And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was reported and told to your servants that Jehovah your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you; therefore we were greatly afraid for our souls because of you, and have done this thing.
And now behold, we are in your hands; do with us as seems good and right in your eyes to do.
Thus he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they did not kill them.
And that day Joshua made them woodcutters and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Jehovah, in the place which He would choose, even to this day.
Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,
that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,
Come up to me and help me, that we may strike Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.
And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; not a man of them shall stand before you.
Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.
And Jehovah routed them before Israel, struck them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the way that goes to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
And it happened, as they fled before Israel and were on the descent of Beth Horon, that Jehovah cast down large hailstones from the heavens upon them as far as Azekah, and they died. There were more who died from the hailstones than the sons of Israel had killed with the sword.
Then Joshua spoke to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel, and he said in the eyes of Israel: Sun, stand still over Gibeon; and Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
And the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the people took vengeance upon their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of the heavens, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.
And there has been no day like that, before it or after it, that Jehovah heeded the voice of a man; for Jehovah fought for Israel.
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
And it was reported to Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.
And Joshua said, Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them.
And do not stay there yourselves, but pursue your enemies, and strike their rear guard. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for Jehovah your God has delivered them into your hand.
And it happened, while Joshua and the sons of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who had escaped entered fortified cities.
And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.
And Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.
And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings. And they drew near and put their feet on their necks.
And Joshua said to them, Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus Jehovah will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.
And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hung them on five trees; and they were hanging on the trees until evening.
And so at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.
On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them; all the souls who were in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah; and they fought against Libnah.
And Jehovah also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it.
And Jehovah delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.
From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it.
They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the souls who were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.
And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword; its king, all its cities, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in it.
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and they fought against it.
And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.
Thus Joshua conquered all the lands of the mountains, and the south and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded.
And Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea as far as Gaza, and all the land of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon.
All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Jehovah the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard these things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,
and to the kings who were from the north, in the mountains, in the plain south of Chinnereth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,
to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains, and the Hivite below Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
And they went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.
And when all these kings had met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
And Jehovah said to Joshua, Do not be afraid before them, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.
So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and fell upon them.
And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them and pursued them to Greater Sidon, to the Brook Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they struck them until they left none of them remaining.
And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had spoken to him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.
And Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms.
And they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left breathing; and he burned Hazor with fire.
Thus all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded.
But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, which Joshua burned.
And all the spoils of these cities and the livestock, the sons of Israel took as plunder for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left no one breathing.
As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant, thus Moses had commanded Joshua, and thus Joshua did. He did not turn aside from anything of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Thus Joshua took all this land: the mountains, all the south, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the plain; the mountains of Israel and its lowlands,
from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings, and struck them down and killed them.
Joshua made war many days with all those kings.
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All the others they took in battle.
For it was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, and that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
And at that time Joshua came and cut off the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod.
Thus Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Jehovah had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
These are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck, and whose land they dispossessed on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the River Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon and ruled half of Gilead, from Aroer, on the bank of the River Arnon, from the middle of that river, even as far as the River Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites,
and the eastern plain from the Sea of Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain (the Salt Sea), the way to Beth Jeshimoth, and southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
And Og, king of Bashan, and his territory, of the remnant of the giants, who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
and reigned in Mount Hermon, over Salcah, over all Bashan, as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
These Moses the servant of Jehovah and the sons of Israel had struck; and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it as a possession to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
And these are the kings of the land which Joshua and the sons of Israel conquered on this side of the Jordan, on the west, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon as far as Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions,
in the mountains, in the lowlands, in the plains, in the slopes, in the wilderness, and in the south; the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
the king of Aphek, one; the king of Sharon, one;
the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of the nation of Gilgal, one;
the king of Tirzah, one. All the kings, thirty-one.
Now Joshua was old, advanced in years. And Jehovah said to him: You are old, advanced in years, and there remains very much land yet to be possessed.
This is the land that yet remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all Geshuri,
from Sihor, before Egypt, to the border of Ekron northward (which is counted as Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites;
from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;
the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon as far as the entrance to Hamath;
all the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon as far as Misrephoth Maim, and all the Sidonians; them I will dispossess before the sons of Israel; only, divide it by lot to Israel as an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
Now therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
With them the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses has given them, beyond the Jordan eastward, as Moses the servant of Jehovah has given them:
from Aroer on the bank of the River Arnon, and the town that is in the midst of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon;
all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the children of Ammon;
Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salcah;
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants; for Moses had struck and dispossessed them.
Nevertheless the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maachathites, but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
Only to the tribe of Levi he had given no inheritance; the sacrifices by fire unto Jehovah the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He had spoken to them.
And Moses had given to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families.
Their territory was from Aroer, the bank of the River Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
Heshbon and all its cities in the plain: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,
Jahaza, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
Kirjathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the mountain of the valley,
Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth;
all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses had struck with the commanders of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, who were princes of Sihon dwelling in the land.
The sons of Israel also killed with the sword Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner, among their slain.
And the border of the sons of Reuben was the border of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.
Moses also gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.
Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer, which is before Rabbah,
and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir,
and in the valley Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as its border, as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth, on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.
Moses also gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families:
Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, sixty cities;
half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families.
These are what Moses had distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan, from Jericho eastward.
But to the tribe of Levi Moses had given no inheritance; Jehovah the God of Israel, was their inheritance, as He had spoken to them.
These are what the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel divided up as possessions.
Their inheritance was by lot, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.
For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them.
For the sons of Joseph were two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to dwell in, with their common lands for their livestock and their property.
As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.
Then the sons of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him: You know the word which Jehovah had spoken to Moses the man of God concerning you and me in Kadesh Barnea.
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as it was in my heart.
Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed Jehovah my God.
And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and of your sons perpetually, because you have fully followed Jehovah my God.
And now, behold, Jehovah has kept me alive, as He said, these forty-five years, ever since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old.
As yet I am as strong this day as on the day that Moses sent me; just as my strength was then, so now is my strength for war, both to go out and to come in.
Now therefore, give me this mountain of which Jehovah spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fortified. It may be that Jehovah will be with me, and I shall be able to drive them out as Jehovah has spoken.
And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he fully followed Jehovah the God of Israel.
And the name of Hebron formerly was Kirjath Arba (Arba was a great man among the Anakim). And the land had rest from war.
This, then, was the lot of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families: The border of Edom at the Wilderness of Zin southward was the southern extremity.
And their southern border began at the shore of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward.
Then it went out to the southern side of the ascent of Akrabbim, passed along to Zin, ascended on the south side of Kadesh Barnea, passed along to Hezron, went up to Adar, and went around to Karkaa.
From there it passed toward Azmon and went out to the Brook of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. This shall be your southern border.
The east border was the Salt Sea as far as the end of the Jordan. And the border on the northern edge began at the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan.
The border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
And the border went up toward Debir from the Valley of Achor, and it turned northward toward Gilgal, which is in front of the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley. The border continued toward the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel.
And the border went up by the valley of the Son of Hinnom to the southern slope of the Jebusites (which is Jerusalem). The border went up to the top of the mountain before the Valley of Hinnom westward, at the end of the Valley of Rephaim northward.
And the border went around from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and extended to the cities of Mount Ephron. And the border went around to Baalah (which is Kirjath Jearim).
And the border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north (which is Chesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed on to Timnah.
And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward. And the border went around to Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and extended to Jabneel; and the border ended at the sea.
The west border was the Great Sea. This is the border of the sons of Judah all around according to their families.
And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a share among the sons of Judah, according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirjath Arba, which is Hebron (Arba was the father of Anak).
Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak from there: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, born to Anak.
And he went up from there to the inhabitants of Debir (formerly the name of Debir was Kirjath Sepher).
And Caleb said, He who strikes Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.
And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you wish?
She answered, Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the south, give me also springs of water. So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families:
The cities at the extremities of the tribe of the sons of Judah, toward the border of Edom in the south, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,

And in the mountains: Shamir, Jattir, Sochoh,
Dannah, Kirjath Sannah (which is Debir),
Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities with their villages;

Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim) and Rabbah: two cities with their villages.
In the wilderness: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah,
Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi: six cities with their villages.
As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
The lot of the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan, by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho through the mountains to Bethel,
and went out from Bethel to Luz, passed along to the border of the Archites at Ataroth,
and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, as far as the border of Lower Beth Horon to Gezer; and it ended at the sea.
Thus the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took possession.
The border of the sons of Ephraim, according to their families: The border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth Addar as far as Upper Beth Horon.
And the border went out toward the sea on the north side of Michmethath; then the border went around eastward to Taanath Shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah.
And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth and Naarah, reached to Jericho, and came out at the Jordan.
The border went out from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and it ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families.
And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
And they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day and are serving under tribute.
There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph: for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given Gilead and Bashan.
And there was a lot for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families: for the sons of Abiezer, the sons of Helek, the sons of Asriel, the sons of Shechem, the sons of Hepher, and the sons of Shemida; these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.
But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the leaders, saying, Jehovah had commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers. Therefore, according to the mouth of Jehovah, he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers.
Ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan,
because the daughters of Manasseh had inherited an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.
And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, that lies before Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.
Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim.
And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.
Southward it was Ephraim’s, northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was its border. It met up with Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
And in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, Ibleam and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of En Dor and its daughter-villages, the inhabitants of Taanach and its daughter-villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; three high regions.
Yet the sons of Manasseh could not dispossess those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.
And it happened, when the sons of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive them out to dispossess them.
And the sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you given us only one lot and one portion to inherit, since we are a numerous people, inasmuch as Jehovah has blessed us until now?
And Joshua answered them, If you are a numerous people, then go up to the forests and clear out a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.
And the sons of Joseph said, The mountains are not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages and those who are of the Valley of Jezreel.
And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and Manasseh, saying, You are a numerous people and have great power, you shall not have only one lot,
but the mountains shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it shall be yours to its extremities; for you shall dispossess the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots and are strong.
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them.
But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.
And Joshua said to the children of Israel: How long will you be slack to go and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers has given to you?
Provide from among you three men for each tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise up and go through the land, plot it out according to their inheritance, and come back to me.
And they shall divide it into seven parts. Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north.
You shall therefore plot out the land into seven parts and bring the map here to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God.
But the Levites have no portion among you, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan to the east, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given to them.
And the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to plot out the land, saying, Go, walk through the land, survey it, and come back to me, and I shall cast lots for you here before Jehovah at Shiloh.
So the men went, passed through the land, and plotted it out in a book into seven territories by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh.
And Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh before Jehovah, and there Joshua distributed the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.
And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up alongside Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.
The border went over from there toward Luz, beside Luz (which is Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that is on the south side of Lower Beth Horon.
And the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that lies before Beth Horon southward; and it ended at Kirjath Baal (which is Kirjath Jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the west side.
The south side began at the end of Kirjath Jearim, and the border extended on the west and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
And the border came down to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, beside the city of the Jebusites on the south, and descended to En Rogel.
And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, before the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.
Then it passed along toward the north side of the plains, and went down to the plains.
And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; and the border ended at the north bay at the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
The Jordan was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to its borders all around, according to their families.
And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, the valley of Keziz,
Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
Avim, Parah, Ophrah,
Chephar Haammoni, Ophni, and Gaba: twelve cities with their villages;
Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah,
Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
Zelah, Eleph, Jebus (which is Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kirjath: fourteen cities with their villages. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.
The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. And their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah.
They had in their inheritance Beer-sheba (Sheba), Moladah,
Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,
Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,
Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteen cities and their villages;
Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan: four cities and their villages;
and all the villages that were all around these cities as far as Baalath Beer, Ramah of the south. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families.
The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was included in the portion of the sons of Judah, for the portion of the sons of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the sons of Simeon had their inheritance within their inheritance.
The third lot came out for the sons of Zebulun according to their families, and the border of their inheritance was as far as Sarid.
Their border went toward the west and to Maralah, went to Dabbasheth, and extended along the brook that is in front of Jokneam.
Then from Sarid it turned eastward toward the sunrise along the border of Chisloth Tabor, and went out toward Daberath, going up to Japhia.
And from there it passed along on the east of Gath Hepher, toward Eth Kazin, and extended to Rimmon, to Neah.
And the border went around it on the north side to Hannathon, and ended in the valley of Jiphthah El;
and included Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
The fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the sons of Issachar according to their families.
And their territory went to Jezreel, and included Chesulloth, Shunem,
Haphraim, Shion, Anaharath,
Rabbith, Kishion, Abez,
Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez.
And the border reached to Tabor, Shahazimah, and Beth Shemesh; their border ended at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families.
And their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
Alammelech, Amad, and Mishal; it reached to Mount Carmel westward, along the brook Shihor Libnath.
It turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon; and it reached to Zebulun and to the Valley of Jiphthah El, then northward beyond Beth Emek and Neiel, going past Cabul on the left,
including Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
And the border turned to Ramah and to the fortified city of Tyre; from there the border turned to Hosah, and ended at the sea by the region of Achzib.
Included also were Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
The sixth lot came out to the sons of Naphtali, for the sons of Naphtali according to their families.
And their border began at Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, Adami Nekeb, and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum; it ended at the Jordan.
And the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there toward Hukkok; it extended to Zebulun on the south side and Asher on the west side, and ended at Judah by the Jordan toward the sunrise.
And the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,
Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,
Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh: nineteen cities with their villages.
This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.
The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families.
And the territory of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,
Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Jethlah,
Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the region near Joppa.
And the border of the sons of Dan went beyond these, because the sons of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and took it; and they struck it with the edge of the sword, dispossessed it, and dwelt in it. They called Leshem, Dan, after the name of their father Dan.
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
When they had made an end of dividing the land as an inheritance according to their borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun.
According to the mouth of Jehovah they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim. And he built the city and dwelt in it.
These were the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel divided as an inheritance by lot at Shiloh before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting. Thus they made an end of dividing up the land.
Jehovah also spoke to Joshua, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying: Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I have spoken to you by the hand of Moses,
that the slayer who kills a soul accidentally or unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
And when he flees to one of those cities, and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declares his matter in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to themselves, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, but did not hate him beforehand.
And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.
So they appointed Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountains of Naphtali, Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and Kirjath Arba (which is Hebron) in the mountains of Judah.
And on the other side of the Jordan, across from Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead, of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, of the tribe of Manasseh.
These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who sojourns among them, that whoever kills a soul accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, to stand before the congregation.
Then the heads of the fathers of the Levites came near to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, Jehovah has commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their common lands for our cattle.
And the sons of Israel gave to the Levites from their inheritance, at the mouth of Jehovah, these cities and their common lands:
And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites. And the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah, from the tribe of Simeon, and from the tribe of Benjamin.
The rest of the sons of Kohath had ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim, from the tribe of Dan, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.
And the sons of Gershon had thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar, from the tribe of Asher, from the tribe of Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
The sons of Merari according to their families had twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben, from the tribe of Gad, and from the tribe of Zebulun.
And the sons of Israel gave these cities with their common lands by lot to the Levites, as Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses.
And they gave from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon these cities which are designated by name,
which were for the sons of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the sons of Levi; for theirs was the first lot.
And they gave them Kirjath Arba (Arba was the father of Anak), which is Hebron, in the mountains of Judah, with the common land surrounding it.
But the fields of the city and its villages they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his possession.
Thus to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Libnah with its common land,
Jattir with its common land, Eshtemoa with its common land,
Holon with its common land, Debir with its common land,
Ain with its common land, Juttah with its common land, and Beth Shemesh with its common land: nine cities from those two tribes;
and from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its common land, Geba with its common land,
Anathoth with its common land, and Almon with its common land: four cities.
All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their common lands.
And the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, the rest of the sons of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot from the tribe of Ephraim.
For they gave them Shechem with its common land in the mountains of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the slayer), Gezer with its common land,
Kibzaim with its common land, and Beth Horon with its common land: four cities;
and from the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its common land, Gibbethon with its common land,
Aijalon with its common land, and Gath Rimmon with its common land: four cities;
and from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with its common land and Gath Rimmon with its common land: two cities.
All the ten cities with their common lands were for the rest of the families of the sons of Kohath.
Also to the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, they gave Golan in Bashan with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), and Be Eshterah with its common land: two cities;
and from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its common land, Daberath with its common land,
Jarmuth with its common land, and En Gannim with its common land: four cities;
and from the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its common land, Abdon with its common land,
Helkath with its common land, and Rehob with its common land: four cities;
and from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Hammoth Dor with its common land, and Kartan with its common land: three cities.
All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their common lands.
And to the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its common land, Kartah with its common land,
Dimnah with its common land, and Nahalal with its common land: four cities;
and from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its common land, Jahaz with its common land,
Kedemoth with its common land, and Mephaath with its common land: four cities;
and from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its common land (a city of refuge for the slayer), Mahanaim with its common land,
Heshbon with its common land, and Jazer with its common land: four cities in all.
So all the cities for the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities with their common lands.
Every one of these cities had its common land surrounding it; thus were all these cities.
Thus Jehovah gave to Israel all the land of which He had sworn to give to their fathers, and they took possession of it and dwelt in it.
And Jehovah gave them rest all around, according to all that He had sworn to their fathers. And not a man of all their enemies stood against them; Jehovah delivered all their enemies into their hand.
Not a word failed of any good thing which Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.
Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
and said to them: You have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you.
You have not left your brethren these many days, to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God.
And now Jehovah your God has given rest to your brethren, as He has promised them; now therefore, return and go to your tents and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of Jehovah has given you on the other side of the Jordan.
But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the Law which Moses the servant of Jehovah has charged you, to love Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to cleave unto Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.
Now to the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half of it Joshua gave a possession among their brethren on this side of the Jordan, westward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,
and spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren.
And the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they had obtained according to the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And when they came to the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan; an altar of great appearance.
And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar across from the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, at the border of the children of Israel.
And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered together at Shiloh to go to war against them.
Then the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead,
and with him ten leaders, each one a chief leader of a father’s house of every tribe of Israel; and each one was the head of the house of his father among the thousands of Israel.
And they came to the sons of Reuben, to the sons of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
Thus says the whole congregation of Jehovah: What treachery is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following Jehovah, in that you have built for yourselves an altar, that you might rebel this day against Jehovah?
Was the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed to this day, and there was a plague in the congregation of Jehovah,
but that you must turn away this day from following Jehovah? And it shall be, if you rebel today against Jehovah, that tomorrow He will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
Nevertheless, if the land of your possession is unclean, then cross over to the land of the possession of Jehovah, where the tabernacle of Jehovah stands, and take possession among us; but do not rebel against Jehovah, nor rebel against us, by building yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God.
Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man was not the only one to die in his iniquity.
Then the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel:
Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, Jehovah, the Mighty God of gods, He knows, and let Israel itself know; if it is in rebellion, or if in treachery against Jehovah, do not save us this day.
If we have built ourselves an altar to turn from following Jehovah, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to offer peace offerings on it, let Jehovah Himself exact it.
But we have done it in this manner out of concern, thinking, In time to come your sons may speak to our sons, saying, What have you to do with Jehovah the God of Israel?
For Jehovah has made the Jordan a border between you and us, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad. You have no portion in Jehovah. Thus your sons would make our sons cease to fear Jehovah.
Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,
but that it may be a witness between you and us and our generations after us, that we may perform the service of Jehovah before Him with our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your sons may not say to our sons in time to come, You have no portion in Jehovah.
Therefore we thought that it shall be, when they say this to us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Look at the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers have made, though not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between you and us.
Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah, to turn from following Jehovah this day, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of Jehovah our God which is before His tabernacle.
And when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation, the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh had spoken, it pleased them.
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the sons of Manasseh, This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us, because you have not committed this treachery against Jehovah. Now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah.
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders, returned from the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought back word to them.
And the thing was good in the eyes of the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of going against them in battle, to destroy the land where the sons of Reuben and Gad were living.
And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar, Witness, For it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.
Now it came to pass, many days after Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua had grown old and advanced in age.
And Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, their heads, their judges, and their officers, and said to them: I have become old and advanced in age.
You have seen all that Jehovah your God has done to all these nations because of you, for Jehovah your God is He who was fighting for you.
Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, as far as the Great Sea westward.
And Jehovah your God will thrust them out before you and dispossess them before your faces. Thus you shall possess their land, as Jehovah your God has spoken to you.
Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, that you not turn aside from it to the right hand or to the left,
and that you not go among these nations, these remaining among you. You shall not make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause anyone to swear by them; you shall not serve them nor bow down to them,
but you shall cleave unto Jehovah your God, as you have done to this day.
For Jehovah has driven out before you great and mighty nations; but as for you, no one has been able to stand before you to this day.
One man of you shall chase a thousand, for Jehovah your God is He who is fighting for you, as He has spoken to you.
Therefore take diligent heed to your souls, to love Jehovah your God.
But if you turn back, to go away and cleave to the remnant of the nations; these that remain among you; and make marriages with them, and go in to them and they to you,
know and understand that Jehovah your God will no longer dispossess these nations before you. But they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.
Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth. And you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing has failed of all the good things which Jehovah your God has spoken concerning you. All of them have come to pass for you; not one word of them has failed.
Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you which Jehovah your God has spoken to you, so Jehovah will bring upon you every evil thing, to destroy you from this good land which Jehovah your God has given to you.
When you have transgressed the covenant of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them, then the anger of Jehovah will burn against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given to you.
And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and summoned the elders of Israel, their heads, their judges, and their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Your fathers (Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor) dwelt on the other side of the River in ancient times; and they served other gods.
And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac.
To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to what I have done among them. Afterward I have brought you out.
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.
And they cried out unto Jehovah; and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And your eyes saw what I have done in Egypt. And you dwelt in the wilderness many days.
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them before you.
Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you.
But I was not willing to heed Balaam; therefore he continued to bless you. And I delivered you out of his hand.
And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the lords of Jericho fought against you; also the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand.
I sent the hornet before you which drove them out before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword or with your bow.
I have given you a land for which you have not labored, and cities which you have not built, and you dwell in them; you are eating of the vineyards and olive groves which you have not planted.
Now therefore, fear Jehovah, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers have served on the other side of the River and in Egypt. Serve Jehovah!
And if it seems evil to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers have served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah.
And the people answered and said: Far be it from us to forsake Jehovah to serve other gods;
for Jehovah our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who has done those great signs before our eyes, and preserved us in all the way that we have gone and among all the people through whom we have passed.
And Jehovah drove out before us all the people, including the Amorites who were living in the land. We also will serve Jehovah, for He is our God.
And Joshua said to the people, You cannot serve Jehovah, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous Mighty God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
If you forsake Jehovah and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do evil and consume you, after He has done you good.
And the people said to Joshua, No, but we will serve Jehovah!
And Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Jehovah for yourselves, to serve Him. And they said, We are witnesses.
Now therefore, he said, put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel.
And the people said to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and established for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took a large stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah.
And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which He has spoken to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.
So Joshua sent the people away, each to his inheritance.
And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died, being one hundred and ten years old.
And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Serah, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua, who had known all the works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.
And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the sons of Joseph.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill belonging to Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the mountains of Ephraim.
Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked Jehovah, saying, Who shall first go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?
And Jehovah said, Judah shall go up. Behold I have delivered the land into his hand.
And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory. And Simeon went with him.
And Judah went up, and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they struck ten thousand men at Bezek.
And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
And Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
And Adoni-Bezek said, Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me. Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
Now the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the south, and in the lowlands.
Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)
And Caleb said, Whoever strikes Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.
And it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you wish?
And she said to him, Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the south, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
Now the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, had gone up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.
Judah also took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.
Thus Jehovah was with Judah. And they dispossessed the mountains, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron.
And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he dispossessed from there the three sons of Anak.
But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Jehovah was with them.
And the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)
And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, Please show us the entrance to the city, and we will deal kindly with you.
So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.
And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.
However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its daughter-villages, or Taanach and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its daughter-villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its daughter-villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.
And it came to pass, when Israel had become strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive out to dispossess them.
Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put to tribute.
Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.
But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.
Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. And the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put to tribute under them.
And the Amorites squeezed the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;
but the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph became heavy, they were put to tribute.
And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
And the Angel of Jehovah came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: I led you up from Egypt and brought you into the land of which I had sworn to your fathers; and I said, I will never break My covenant with you.
And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall pull down their altars. But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?
Therefore I also have said, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
And it came about, when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.
Thus they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there unto Jehovah.
And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.
Thus the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, who had seen all the great works of Jehovah which He had done for Israel.
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.
And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.
When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who had not known Jehovah nor the work which He had done for Israel.
And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and served the Baals;
and they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they went after other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked Jehovah to anger.
They forsook Jehovah and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who plundered them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
Wherever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had said, and as Jehovah had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.
Nevertheless, Jehovah raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.
Yet they would not heed their judges, but they committed adultery with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked, to obey the commandments of Jehovah; they did not do so.
And when Jehovah raised up judges for them, Jehovah was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity before their groaning because of those oppressing and thrusting at them.
And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they would turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, by going after other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They have not failed from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He said, Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I have commanded their fathers, and has not obeyed My voice,
I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua has left when he died,
so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the way of Jehovah, to walk in it as their fathers have kept it, or not.
Therefore Jehovah left those nations, without driving them out quickly; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
Now these are the nations which Jehovah left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan
(only so that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it),
namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods.
And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. They forgot Jehovah their God, and served the Baals and groves.
Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.
And when the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and Jehovah delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.
And the land had rest for forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. So Jehovah strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And he gathered to himself the sons of Ammon and Amalek, went and struck Israel, and took possession of the City of Palm Trees.
And the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.
And when the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah, Jehovah raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man with his right hand impeded. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
Now Ehud made himself a sword (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and girded it under his clothes on his right thigh.
And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)
And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who were carrying the tribute.
But he himself turned back from the graven images that were at Gilgal, and said, I have a secret matter for you, O king. He said, Keep silence. And all who were standing by him went out from him.
And Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool roof chamber). And Ehud said, I have a word from God for you. So he arose from his seat.
And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
And the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and his excrement came out.
Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
And when he had gone out, his servants came to look, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they thought, Surely he is covering his feet in the cool chamber.
So they waited till they were ashamed, and behold he was not opening the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And behold, their master was fallen dead on the floor.
And Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the graven images and slipped away to Seirah.
And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the shofar in the mountains of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came down with him from the mountains, with him before them.
And he said to them, Follow me, for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.
And at that time they struck about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped.
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel.
When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim.
And the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.
And she was dwelling under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.
And she sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, Has not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded: Go and proceed to Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;
and I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand.
And Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!
And she said, I will walk to go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.
And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men at his feet, and Deborah went up with him.
Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the plain at Zaanaim, near Kedesh.
And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.
And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this is the day in which Jehovah has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not Jehovah gone out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind him.
And Jehovah routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.
But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not one was left.
However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear. And when he had turned aside to her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.
And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. So she opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.
And he said to her, Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, Is there any man here? you shall say, No.
Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. Thus he died.
And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, I will show you the man whom you are seeking. And when he went into her tent, behold, Sisera was lying dead with the peg in his temple.
So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.
And the hand of the sons of Israel continued and proceeded to grow stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan.
Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying:
When commanders lead in Israel, when the people willingly offer themselves, bless Jehovah!
Hear, O kings! Give ear, O princes! I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah; I will make music unto Jehovah the God of Israel.
Jehovah, when You went out from Seir, when You marched from the field of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, even the clouds dropped water;
the mountains flowed before Jehovah, this Sinai, before Jehovah the God of Israel.
In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were deserted, and the travelers walked along the byways.
Village life ceased, it ceased in Israel, until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.
They chose new gods; then there was war in the gates; not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.
My heart is with the governors of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!
Sing out, you who ride on white donkeys, who sit on carpets, and who walk along the road.
At the sound where they divide the flocks among the places to draw water, there they shall recount the righteous acts of Jehovah, the righteous acts to His village dwellers in Israel; then the people of Jehovah shall go down to the gates.
Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead your captives captive, O son of Abinoam!
Then the remnant came down and had dominion over the kings of the nations; for me Jehovah trod down the mighty.
Out of Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek. After you, Benjamin, with your peoples, from Machir came down governors, and from Zebulun those who bear the staff of scribes.
And the commanders of Issachar were with Deborah; as was Issachar, so was Barak, sent on foot into the valley. Among the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart.
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks? At the divisions of Reuben were great searchings of heart.
Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, and why did Dan remain on ships? Asher continued at the seashore, and stayed by his landings.
Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their souls even to death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the field.
The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of silver.
They fought from the heavens; the stars from their courses fought against Sisera.
The torrent of Kishon swept them away, that ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon. O my soul, tread on in strength!
Then the horses’ hooves pounded, the galloping, galloping of his steeds.
Curse Meroz, said the Angel of Jehovah, curse its inhabitants bitterly, because they did not come to the help of Jehovah, to the help of Jehovah against the mighty.
Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; blessed is she among women in the tent.
He asked for water, she gave milk; she brought out curds in a lordly bowl.
She stretched her hand to the tent peg, her right hand to the workman’s hammer; she has hammered Sisera, she has destroyed his head, she has pierced and struck through his temple.
At her feet he has bowed down, he has fallen, he has lain down; at her feet he has bowed down, he has fallen; where he has bowed down, there he has fallen destroyed.
The mother of Sisera has looked through the window, and cried out through the lattice, Why has his chariot delayed to come? Why have the hoof beats of his chariot waited?
Her wise ladies answered her, Yea, she answers herself:
Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: to each chief warrior a girl to love; for Sisera, plunder of dyed garments, plunder of garments embroidered and dyed, two pieces of dyed embroidery for the necks of the plunderers?
Thus let all Your enemies perish, O Jehovah! But let those who love Him be like the sun when it goes forth in its might. Thus the land was quiet forty years.
And the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. So Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years,
and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. In the face of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, the caves, and the strongholds which are in the mountains.
So it was that when Israel had sown, the Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the sons of the East would come up against them.
And they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor donkey.
For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as the abundance of locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it.
And Israel was brought exceedingly low before Midian, and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.
And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah because of the Midianites,
that Jehovah sent a man who was a prophet unto the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage;
and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
Also I said to you, I am Jehovah your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed My voice.
And the Angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was threshing wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from before the Midianites.
And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him, and said to him, Jehovah is with you, you mighty man of valor!
Gideon said to Him, O my lord, if Jehovah is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all His miracles which our fathers told us about, saying, Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt? But now Jehovah has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
And Jehovah turned to him and said, Go in this might of yours, and you shall deliver Israel from the hand of the Midianites. Have I not sent you?
And he said to Him, O my Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold my company is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
And Jehovah said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.
And he said to Him, If now I have found favor in Your eyes, then perform a sign for me, that it is You speaking with me.
Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set it before You. And He said, I will wait until you come back.
And Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought them out to Him under the terebinth tree and brought them near.
And the Angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
Then the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened bread; and fire rose up out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight.
And Gideon perceived that He was the Angel of Jehovah. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord Jehovah! For I have seen the Angel of Jehovah face to face.
And Jehovah said to him, Peace unto you; do not fear, you shall not die.
And Gideon built an altar there unto Jehovah, and called it Jehovah Shalom. To this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
Now it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that your father has, and chop down the grove that is beside it;
and build an altar unto Jehovah your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the grove which you shall chop down.
And Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as Jehovah had spoken to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night.
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the grove that was beside it was chopped down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar which had been built.
And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And when they had inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.
Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has chopped down the grove that was beside it.
And Joash said to all who stood against him, Would you plead for Baal? Would you deliver him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been torn down!
Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he has torn down his altar.
Then all the Midianites and Amalekites, the sons of the east, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
And the Spirit of Jehovah clothed Gideon; and he blew the shofar, and the Abiezrites assembled behind him.
And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also assembled behind him. He also sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
And Gideon said to God, If You are delivering Israel by my hand as You have said,
behold, I am putting a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will deliver Israel by my hand, as You have spoken.
And it was so. When he arose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
Then Gideon said to God, Do not let Your anger burn against me, but let me speak just once more: Let me prove, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.
And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.
Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him arose early and encamped beside the well of Harod, so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.
And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites into their hands, that Israel not glorify itself against Me, saying, My own hand has delivered me.
Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him turn back and depart early from Mount Gilead. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
And Jehovah said to Gideon, The people are still too many; bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there. And it shall be, that of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, This one shall not go with you, the same shall not go.
So he brought the people down to the water. And Jehovah said to Gideon, Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.
And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.
And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped I will deliver you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.
So the people took provisions and their shofars in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
And it came to pass on the same night that Jehovah said to him, Rise up, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.
But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,
and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. And he went down with Purah his servant to the extremity of the armed men who were in the camp.
Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the sons of the east, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore for multitude.
And when Gideon came, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, I have dreamed a dream: Behold, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent lay flat.
And his companion answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.
And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he bowed down. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, Arise, for Jehovah has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.
And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a shofar into each man’s hand, with empty jars, and torches inside the jars.
And he said to them, Look at me and do likewise; and behold, when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:
When I blow the shofar, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the shofars on every side of the whole camp, and say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!
So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the shofars and shattered the jars that were in their hands.
And the three companies blew the shofars and shattered the jars; they held the torches in their left hands and the shofars in their right hands for blowing; and they cried out, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!
And each man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.
And when the three hundred blew the shofars, Jehovah set every man’s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.
And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and chased after the Midianites.
And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and seize from them the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the waters as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.
And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.
Now the men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites? And they strongly complained against him.
So he said to them, What have I done now in comparison to you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison to you? Then their anger toward him subsided when he spoke those words.
And when Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men with him crossed over, exhausted but still pursuing.
And he said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
And the rulers of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?
And Gideon said, Therefore, when Jehovah has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will thresh your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!
And he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.
So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come back in peace, I will tear down this tower!
Now Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of all the army of the sons of the east; for one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen.
And Gideon went up by the way of those who dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he struck the army while the camp felt secure.
And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.
Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle at sunrise.
And he seized a young man of the men of Succoth and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the rulers of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men.
And he came to the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you have taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?
And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he gave knowledge to the men of Succoth.
And he tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor? And they answered, As you are, so were they; each one with the appearance of the son of a king.
And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As Jehovah lives, if you had let them live, I would not have killed you.
And he said to Jether his firstborn, Rise up and kill them! But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.
So Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise up yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength. So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, both you and your son, and your son’s son also; for you have delivered us from the hand of Midian.
And Gideon said to them, I shall not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; Jehovah shall rule over you.
And Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder. For they had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.
And they answered, We will extend to give them. And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder.
And the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple garments which were on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were around their camels’ necks.
And Gideon made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, Ophrah. And all Israel committed adultery with it there. It became a snare to Gideon and to his house.
Thus Midian was subdued before the sons of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. And the land was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon.
And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
And Gideon had seventy sons proceeding from his loins, for he had many wives.
And his concubine in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
And Gideon the son of Joash died at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned back and committed adultery with the Baals, and established Baal-Berith as their god.
Thus the children of Israel did not remember Jehovah their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies all around;
nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) according to all the good he had done for Israel.
Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
Please speak in the ears of all the lords of Shechem: Which is better for you, for all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal to rule over you, or for one to rule over you? Remember that I am your own flesh and bone.
And his mother’s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the ears of all the lords of Shechem; and their heart was inclined after Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.
And they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the house of Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men, who went after him.
And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he had hidden himself.
And all the lords of Shechem gathered together, all the house of Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree that was situated at Shechem.
Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them: Listen to me, you lords of Shechem, that God may listen to you!
The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, Reign over us!
But the olive tree said to them, Should I cease from my fatness, with which they honor God and men, and go to sway over the trees?
Then the trees said to the fig tree, You come and reign over us!
But the fig tree said to them, Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to sway over the trees?
Then the trees said to the vine, You come and reign over us!
But the vine said to them, Should I cease my new wine, which cheers both God and men, and go to sway over the trees?
Then all the trees said to the bramble, You come and reign over us!
And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me as king over you, then come and seek refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon!
Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the dealings of his hands;
for my father fought for you, cast aside his own soul, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian;
but you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the lords of Shechem, because he is your brother;
if then you have dealt in truth and integrity towards Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
But if not, let fire come from Abimelech and devour the lords of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come from the lords of Shechem and from the house of Millo and devour Abimelech!
And Jotham fled and escaped; and he went to Beer and dwelt there, away from the face of Abimelech his brother.
After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years,
God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem; and the lords of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,
that the wrong done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and upon the lords of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.
And the lords of Shechem set an ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was reported to Abimelech.
Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the lords of Shechem trusted him.
And they went out into the fields, and gathered grapes from their vineyards and trod them, and rejoiced. And they went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him?
Would therefore that this people were given into my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. So he said to Abimelech, Increase your army and come out!
And when Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.
And he sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they are fortifying the city against you.
Now therefore, rise up by night, you and the people with you, and lie in wait in the field.
And it shall be in the morning as the sun rises, that you shall rise up early and rush upon the city; and when he and the people with him come out against you, you shall do to them as your hand shall find to do.
So Abimelech and all the people with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people with him rose up from the ambush.
And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains! But Zebul said to him, You are seeing the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.
And Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, people are coming down from the midst of the land, and another company is coming from the plain by way of the fortunetellers.
Then Zebul said to him, Where indeed is your mouth now, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Are not these the people whom you have despised? Go out now and fight with them.
So Gaal went out before the lords of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded, to the entrance of the gate.
Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so as to not dwell in Shechem.
And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they reported to Abimelech.
And he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field, watching. And behold, the people were coming out of the city; and he rose up against them and struck them.
And Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the other two companies rushed upon all who were in the fields and struck them.
And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; he took the city and killed the people who were in it; and he broke down the city and sowed it with salt.
And when all the lords of the tower of Shechem heard it, they entered the underground chambers of the house of the god Berith.
And it was reported to Abimelech that all the lords of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.
And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid it on his shoulder; then he said to the people with him, What you have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.
So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put them against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.
Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it.
But there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, and all the men and women, all the lords of the city, fled there and shut themselves in; and they went up to the top of the tower.
So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
And a certain woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.
And he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, Draw your sword and kill me, that they not say of me, A woman killed him. So his young man thrust him through, and he died.
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place.
Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers.
And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned upon their own heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
After Abimelech there arose to deliver Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim.
He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.
After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years.
And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, which are called Havoth Jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
And Jair died and was buried in Camon.
And the children of Israel again did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and served the Baals and Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook Jehovah and did not serve Him.
So the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel; and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and into the hands of the sons of Ammon.
And that year they shattered and oppressed the children of Israel; for eighteen years, all the children of Israel who were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, in Gilead.
Moreover the sons of Ammon also crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.
And the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah, saying, We have sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!
So Jehovah said to the children of Israel, Did I not deliver you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites and from the sons of Ammon and from the Philistines?
Also the Sidonians and Amalekites and Maonites have oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand.
Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more.
Go and cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.
And the children of Israel said to Jehovah, We have sinned! Do to us whatever seems good in Your eyes; only deliver us this day, we pray.
And they put away the foreign gods from among them and served Jehovah. And His soul was grieved because of Israel’s troubles.
Then the sons of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel assembled together and encamped in Mizpah.
And the people, the rulers of Gilead, said to one another, Who is the man who will begin the fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, but he was the son of a woman of prostitution; and Gilead begot Jephthah.
Gilead’s wife bore sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, You shall have no inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman.
And Jephthah fled from before his brothers and dwelt in the land of Tob; and worthless men collected around Jephthah and went out with him.
It came to pass after a time that the sons of Ammon made war against Israel.
And so it was, when the sons of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
And then they said to Jephthah, Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the sons of Ammon.
So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did you not hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, That is why we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you take me back to fight against the sons of Ammon, and Jehovah delivers them up before me, shall I be your head?
And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Jehovah is witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah.
And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against my land?
And the king of the children of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those lands peaceably.
And Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,
and said to him, Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon;
for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let me pass through your land. But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained in Kadesh.
And they went along through the wilderness and bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Please let us pass through your land into our place.
But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
And Jehovah the God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that land.
They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
And now Jehovah the God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites before His people Israel; should you then possess it?
Will you not possess whatever Chemosh your god gives you to possess? Thus, whatever Jehovah our God dispossesses before us, we will possess.
And now, are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them?
While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why have you not recovered them within that time?
Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you are wronging me by fighting against me. May Jehovah, the Judge, render judgment this day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.
However, the king of the children of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah had sent him.
Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on over toward the sons of Ammon.
And Jephthah vowed a vow unto Jehovah, and said, If You will give over to deliver up the sons of Ammon into my hands,
then it shall be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, shall surely be Jehovah’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.
So Jephthah passed over toward the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and Jehovah delivered them into his hands.
And he struck them from Aroer as far as Minnith; twenty cities; and to Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
And when Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his daughter was coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
And it came to pass when he saw her, that he tore his clothes and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have given my word unto Jehovah, and I cannot go back on it.
So she said to him, My father, if you have opened your mouth unto Jehovah, do unto me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because Jehovah has taken vengeance upon your enemies, the sons of Ammon.
And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.
And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he did to her according to the vow which he had vowed. She had known no man. And it became a custom in Israel,
that the daughters of Israel went four days each year, year after year, to recount the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
Then the men of Ephraim gathered together, crossed over toward Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, Why did you cross over to fight against the sons of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you with fire!
And Jephthah said to them, My people and I were in a great struggle with the sons of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands.
So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I put my soul into my hands and crossed over against the sons of Ammon; and Jehovah delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?
Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites.
The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, Let me cross over, the men of Gilead would say to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No,
then they would say to him, Then say, Shibboleth! And he would say, Sibboleth, for he could not speak it right. Then they would take him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. There fell at that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim.
And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
He had thirty sons. And he sent thirty daughters in marriage outside, and brought in thirty daughters from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years.
And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years.
Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites.
Again the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
Now there was a certain man from Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren and had borne no children.
And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman and said to her, Behold now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.
Now therefore, take heed and do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean.
For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
And the woman came and told her husband, saying, A Man of God has come to me, and His countenance was like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I did not ask Him where He was from, and He did not tell me His name.
And He said to me, Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.
Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah, and said, O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the boy who is to be born.
And God heeded the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
And the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me!
And Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, Are You the Man who spoke to the woman? And He said, I am.
And Manoah said, Now let Your words come to pass! What are the ordinances for the boy, and what are his works?
And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Of all that I have said to the woman let her take heed.
She shall not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I have commanded her let her take heed.
And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, Please let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.
And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah, Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you shall offer it unto Jehovah. (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of Jehovah.)
And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?
And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why do you ask after My name, seeing it is incomprehensible?
So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah. And He did an extraordinary thing while Manoah and his wife were watching;
it happened as the flame went up toward the heavens from the altar; that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar! And Manoah and his wife were watching this, and they fell on their faces to the ground.
And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and his wife. Then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of Jehovah.
And Manoah said to his wife, We shall die the death, because we have seen God!
But his wife said to him, If Jehovah had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have told us such things as these at this time.
And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson; and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.
And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move upon him at the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
Now Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines.
So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.
Then his father and mother said to him, Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.
But his father and mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.
So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came roaring toward him.
And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.
Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she was pleasing in the eyes of Samson.
After some days, when he returned to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion.
And he took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. And when he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
So his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men usually did this.
And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
And Samson said to them, Let me propound a riddle to you. If you expound to declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.
But if you are not able to declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. And they said to him, Propound your riddle, that we may hear it.
And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And for three days they were not able to expound the riddle.
But it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, Entice your husband, that he may expound the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to make us poor? Is that not so?
Then Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, You only hate me! You do not love me! You have propounded a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not expounded it to my father or my mother; so should I declare it to you?
And she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. And she declared the riddle to the sons of her people.
And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down: What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle!
And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had declared the riddle; thus his anger burned. And he went up to his father’s house.
And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.
After some days, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a young goat. And he said, Let me go in to my wife, into her room. But her father would not permit him to go in.
Her father said, I thought in my heart that you hated her like an enemy; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.
And Samson said to them, This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines when I am doing evil to them!
And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned tail to tail, and put a torch between the two tails.
When he had set the torches on fire, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion. So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.
And Samson said to them, Since you did a thing like this, I shall avenge myself on you, and after that I will cease.
And he struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of Etam.
And the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and were spread out at Lehi.
And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? So they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.
Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines rule over us? What is this you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so I have done to them.
But they said to him, We have come down to bind you, to deliver you into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.
And they spoke to him, saying, No, but we will tie to bind you and deliver you into their hand; but we will not put you to death. And they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. And the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon him; and the ropes that were on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds melted from his hands.
And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck a thousand men with it.
Then Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey I have slain a thousand men!
And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.
And he became very thirsty; so he cried out to Jehovah and said, You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
And God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot woman there, and went in to her.
When the Gazites were told, saying, Samson has come here! they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the gate of the city. They were quiet all night, saying, In the morning, when it is daylight, we shall kill him.
And Samson lay down till midnight; then he arose at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two gateposts, pulled them up, bar and all, put them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill that is before Hebron.
Afterward it happened that he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
And the rulers of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, Entice him, and find out where his great strength lies, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.
And Delilah said to Samson, Please tell me where your great strength lies, and with what you may be bound to afflict you.
And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven fresh shoots, not yet dried, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
So the rulers of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh shoots, not yet dried, and she bound him with them.
Now men were lying in wait, staying with her in the room. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! But he broke the shoots as a strand of yarn breaks when it touches fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
Then Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Now, please tell me with what you may be bound.
So he said to her, If they bind to tie me with new ropes with which no work has been done, then I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
Therefore Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And men were lying in wait, staying in the room. But he broke them off his arms like thread.
Delilah said to Samson, Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you may be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head into the web of the loom;
so she wove it tightly with the batten of the loom, and said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled out the batten and the web from the loom.
Then she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great strength lies.
And it came to pass, when she had pressed upon him daily with her words and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death,
that he told her all his heart, and said to her, No razor has ever come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite unto God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and summoned the rulers of the Philistines, saying, Come up once more, for he has told me all his heart. So the rulers of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.
And she made him sleep on her knees, and called for a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. And she began to afflict him, and his strength depart from him.
And she said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! So he awoke from his sleep, and thought, I will go out as before, at other times, and shake myself free! But he had not perceived that Jehovah had departed from him.
And the Philistines took him and bored out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze fetters, and he was grinding in the prison house.
However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
Now the rulers of the Philistines gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice. And they said: Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands!
And when the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said: Our god has delivered into our hands our enemy, the destroyer of our land, and the one who multiplied our dead.
And it happened, when their hearts were feeling good, that they said, Summon Samson, that he may play for us. So they summoned Samson from the prison house, and he made sport before them. And they made him stand between the pillars.
And Samson said to the lad who held his hand, Let me feel the pillars which support the house, that I may lean on them.
Now the house was full of men and women. All the rulers of the Philistines were there; about three thousand men and women on the roof watching while Samson made sport.
And Samson called out to Jehovah, saying, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray! Strengthen me, I pray, only this once, O God, that I may once take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes!
And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and he braced himself against them, one on his right and the other on his left.
And Samson said, Let my soul die with the Philistines! And he pushed with all his might, and the house fell upon the rulers and all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than he had killed in his life.
And his brothers and all his father’s house came down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had judged Israel twenty years.
Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, and about which you had sworn an oath, even saying it in my ears; behold the silver is with me, I have taken it. And his mother said, Blessed of Jehovah are you, my son!
So when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly consecrated the silver from my hand unto Jehovah for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; now therefore, I will return it to you.
Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a graven image, and a molten image; and they were in the house of Micah.
And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod and household idols; and he confirmed the hand of one of his sons, who became his priest.
In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he was a Levite, and sojourned there.
And the man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn wherever he could find a place. And he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he made his way.
And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn wherever I may find.
And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance. So the Levite went in.
And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him.
And Micah confirmed the hand of the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
Then Micah said, Now I know that Jehovah will be good to me, since I have a Levite as priest!
In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance for itself to dwell in; for until that day their inheritance among the tribes of Israel had not fallen to them.
So the children of Dan sent five men of their family from their territory, men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and search it. They said to them, Go, search the land. So they went to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.
While they were at the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, Who has brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?
And he said to them, Thus and so has Micah done for me. He hired me, and I am his priest.
So they said to him, Please inquire of God, that we may know whether the journey on which we go will be prosperous.
And the priest said to them, Go in peace. The way in which you go is before Jehovah.
So the five men departed and went to Laish. They saw the people who were there, how they dwelt safely, in the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure. There was no possession of restraint putting them to shame for anything. They were far from the Sidonians, and they had no business with anyone.
And the spies came back to their brethren at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said to them, What is your report?
So they said, Arise, let us go up against them. For we have seen the land, and behold it is very good. Will you sit still? Do not be sluggish to go to enter to possess the land.
When you go, you will come to a secure people and a large land. For God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.
And six hundred men of the family of the Danites set out from there, from Zorah and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war.
And they went up and encamped in Kirjath Jearim in Judah. (Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind Kirjath Jearim.)
And they passed on from there to the mountains of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
Then the five men who had gone to spy out the land of Laish answered and said to their brethren, Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, household idols, a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore, consider what you should do.
And they turned aside there, and came to the house of the young Levite man, to the house of Micah, and asked after his welfare.
And the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
And the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up, entered there, took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten image. And the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men who were armed with weapons of war.
And when these went into Micah’s house and took the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten image, the priest said to them, What are you doing?
And they said to him, Be quiet, put your hand over your mouth, and come with us; be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the household of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
So the priest’s heart was glad; and he took the ephod, the household idols, and the graven image, and went among the people.
Then they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.
When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.
And they called out to the sons of Dan. So they turned their faces and said to Micah, What ails you, that you have assembled together?
And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you have gone away. Now what more do I have? How can you say to me, What ails you?
And the sons of Dan said to him, Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest men of bitter souls fall upon you, and you lose your soul, with the souls of your household!
And the children of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
And they took what Micah had made, and the priest who had belonged to him, and went to Laish, to a people quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire.
There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no business with anyone. It was in the valley next to Beth Rehob. So they rebuilt the city and dwelt there.
And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel. However, the name of the city formerly was Laish.
And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
And they set up for themselves Micah’s graven image which he had made, all the days the house of God was in Shiloh.
And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning in the remote areas of the mountains of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself, a woman from Bethlehem in Judah.
But his concubine committed adultery against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four months of days.
And her husband rose up and went after her, to speak to her heart, to bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him.
And his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.
And it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, Sustain your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, Please accept my invitation to stay the night, and let your heart be merry.
And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law pressed upon him; so he turned back and lodged there.
And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, Please sustain your heart. So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.
And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, Behold, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. Behold, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go your way early, so that you may go to your tent.
However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose up and departed, and came to a place opposite Jebus (which is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.
They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.
But his master said to him, We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.
And he said to his servant, Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and lodge in Gibeah or in Ramah.
And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.
And they turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open place of the city, for no one received them into his house to lodge.
And behold, an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was sojourning in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites.
And when he lifted up his eyes, he saw the traveling man in the open place of the city; and the old man said, Where are you going, and where do you come from?
And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote areas of the mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of Jehovah. But no one is receiving me into his house,
even though we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.
And the old man said, Peace to you! However, let all your needs be upon me; only do not spend the night in the open place.
So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, certain men of the city, sons of wickedness surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring out the man who has come to your house, that we may know him.
And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not do this disgraceful folly.
Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them whatever seems good to your eyes; but to this man do not do such a disgraceful thing!
But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her wantonly all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.
Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was, till it was light.
And when her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, behold the woman, his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.
And he said to her, Get up and let us be going. But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man rose up and went to his place.
And when he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces with her bones, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
And so it was that all who saw it said, No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. Determine, take counsel, and speak up!
So all the sons of Israel came out, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.
And the chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew the sword.
(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?
And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, My concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to lodge.
And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They had thought to kill me, but instead they have humbled my concubine so that she died.
So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the land of the inheritance of Israel, because they have committed lewdness and disgraceful folly in Israel.
Behold, all of you are sons of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
And all the people rose up as one man, saying, None of us shall go to his tent, nor shall any turn away to his house;
but now this is the thing which we shall do to Gibeah: We shall go up against it by lot.
We shall take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to carry provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the disgrace that they have done in Israel.
So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united as one man.
And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What is this evil that has been done among you?
Now therefore, deliver up the men, the sons of wickedness who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel! But the sons of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel.
And the sons of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the sons of Israel.
And from their cities at that time the sons of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred choice men.
Among all this people were seven hundred choice men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.
And the sons of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, Which of us shall go up first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Judah first!
And the sons of Israel arose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
And the sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day destroyed down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of Israel.
And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again set the battle in array at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day.
And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until evening, and asked counsel of Jehovah, saying, Shall I again draw near for battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin? And Jehovah said, Go up against him.
So the sons of Israel approached the sons of Benjamin on the second day.
And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and destroyed down to the ground eighteen thousand men of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.
And all the children of Israel, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before Jehovah and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.
And the sons of Israel inquired of Jehovah (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease? And Jehovah said, Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.
And Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.
And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times.
And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
And the sons of Benjamin thought, They are struck down before us, as at first. But the sons of Israel had said, Let us flee and draw them away from the city into the highways.
So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel’s men in ambush burst forth from their places in the plain of Geba.
And ten thousand choice men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was heavy. But the Benjamites did not know that evil was upon them.
And Jehovah struck down Benjamin before Israel. And the sons of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred of Benjamin; all who drew the sword.
So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were struck down. And the men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they had trusted on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.
And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush drew out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.
Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city,
whereupon the men of Israel turned around in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they thought, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.
But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and behold the whole city had gone up in smoke to the heavens.
And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that evil had come upon them.
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; and the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst.
They surrounded Benjamin, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the rising sun.
And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.
And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they thrust upon five thousand of them on the highways; and pursued them to Gidom, and killed two thousand men.
So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon for four months.
And the men of Israel turned back against the sons of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword; entire cities, beasts, and all who were found. They also set fire to every city they found.
Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, saying, None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.
And the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening, and lifted up their voices and wept with great weeping,
and said, O Jehovah the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?
And it came to pass the next morning, that the people arose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to Jehovah? For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up to Jehovah at Mizpah, saying, He shall die the death.
And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, One tribe is cut off from Israel today.
What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Jehovah not to give them our daughters as wives?
And they said, What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to Jehovah? And, behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.
For when the people were numbered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there.
And the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.
And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man by lying with him.
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
And the whole congregation sent word to the sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.
And Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.
And the people grieved for Benjamin, because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?
And they said, There must be an inheritance for the remnant of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel.
However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.
Then they said, Behold, there is a yearly feast of Jehovah in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.
Therefore they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go, lie in wait in the vineyards,
and watch; and when the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; and go to the land of Benjamin.
And it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be gracious to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, thus making yourselves guilty of your oath.
And the sons of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. And they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.
So the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they departed from there, every man to his inheritance.
In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did what was right in his own eyes.
Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the land of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.
The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the land of Moab and remained there.
Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
And they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.
Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two children and her husband.
Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the land of Moab, for she had heard in the land of Moab that Jehovah had visited His people by giving them bread.
Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother’s house. Jehovah deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
Jehovah grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband. And she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept.
And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people.
And Naomi said, Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Are there yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
Turn back, my daughters, go; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons,
would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of Jehovah has gone out against me!
And they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
And she said, Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.
But Ruth said: Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.
Where you die, I will die, and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts you and me.
When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.
So the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that all the city was in a stir because of them; and they said, Is this Naomi?
And she said to them, Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
I went out full, and Jehovah has brought me back home empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since Jehovah has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?
Thus Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the land of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
Now Naomi had an acquaintance, a kinsman of her husband, a mighty man of wealth of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz.
And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Please let me go to the fields, and glean heads of grain after him in whose eyes I may find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the fields belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Jehovah be with you! And they answered him, Jehovah bless you!
Then Boaz said to his servant who was appointed over the reapers, Whose young woman is this?
And the servant who was appointed over the reapers answered and said, It is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the land of Moab.
And she said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she sat a little in the house.
Then Boaz said to Ruth, You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women.
Let your eyes be on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.
And she fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?
And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully reported to me, all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you have not known before.
May Jehovah reward your work, and full wages be given you by Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge.
And she said, Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken to the heart of your maidservant, though I am not like one of your maidservants.
And Boaz said to her at mealtime, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar. So she sat beside the reapers, and he held out parched grain to her; and she ate and was satisfied, and had some left over.
And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.
Also let grain from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave it that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.
So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
And she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out and gave to her what had been left over after she had been satisfied.
And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? And where have you worked? Blessed is the one taking notice of you. So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.
And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of Jehovah, who has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead! And Naomi said to her, This man is next of kin to us, a kinsman redeemer.
And Ruth the Moabitess said, He also said to me, You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.
And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that you not be fallen upon in another field.
So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek a secure rest for you, that it may be well with you?
Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our kinsman? Behold, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.
Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, dress up and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you shall do.
And she said to her, All that you say to me I will do.
So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had charged her.
And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was glad, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
And it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet.
And he said, Who are you? So she answered, I am Ruth, your maidservant. Spread your skirt over your maidservant, for you are a kinsman redeemer.
And he said, Blessed are you of Jehovah, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.
And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you speak, for all the people of my town know that you are a woman of strength.
Now it is true that I am a kinsman redeemer; however, there is a kinsman redeemer closer than I.
Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be that if he will redeem you, good, let him do it. But if he does not want to redeem you, then I will be your kinsman redeemer, as Jehovah lives! Lie down until morning.
So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. And he said, Do not let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.
And he said, Bring the shawl that is on you and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six ephahs of barley, and laid it on her. And she went into the city.
And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Is that you, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done for her.
And she said, These six ephahs of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Do not go empty to your mother-in-law.
Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.
And Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the kinsman redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So he said, Ho there, you! Turn aside and sit down here. So he came aside and sat down.
And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.
And he said to the kinsman redeemer, Naomi, who has come back from the land of Moab, has sold the piece of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech.
And I thought to uncover your ear to say, Buy it in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you. And he said, I will redeem it.
Then Boaz said, On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy it from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.
And the kinsman redeemer said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem it.
Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to establish anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was an attestation in Israel.
Therefore the kinsman redeemer said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself; and he drew off his sandal.
And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.
Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.
And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Jehovah make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
May your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the seed which Jehovah shall give to you from this young woman.
So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, Jehovah gave her conception, and she bore a son.
And the women said to Naomi, Blessed is Jehovah, who has not left you this day without a kinsman redeemer; and may his name be famous in Israel!
And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.
And Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and nursed him.
Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron;
Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab;
Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;
Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed;
Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the mountains of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
And this man went up from his city year after year to bow down and sacrifice unto Jehovah of Hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests unto Jehovah there.
And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters.
But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, although Jehovah had closed up her womb.
And her rival also provoked her to vexation, to make her tremble, because Jehovah had closed up her womb.
And so it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of Jehovah, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.
Then Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why does your heart quiver? Am I not better to you than ten sons?
So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of Jehovah.
And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah and wept with weeping.
And she vowed a vow and said, O Jehovah of Hosts, if You will look to see the affliction of Your handmaid and remember me, and not forget Your handmaid, but will give Your handmaid a male child, then I shall give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.
And it happened, as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli was watching her mouth.
Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk.
So Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!
And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of intense spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.
Do not consider your handmaid for a daughter of worthlessness, for out of the abundance of my anxiety and vexation I have spoken until now.
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.
And she said, Let your handmaid find favor in your eyes. So the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.
And they arose early in the morning and bowed down before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and Jehovah remembered her.
So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked for him from Jehovah.
Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, Not until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah and remain there always.
And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in your eyes; wait until you have weaned him. Only may Jehovah establish His word. So the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah at Shiloh: the child, the boy.
And they slaughtered a bull, and brought the boy to Eli.
And she said, O my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here to pray unto Jehovah.
For this boy I prayed, and Jehovah granted me my petition which I have asked of Him.
Therefore I also have given him unto Jehovah; as long as he lives he is loaned unto Jehovah. And he bowed down before Jehovah there.
And Hannah prayed and said: My heart has rejoiced in Jehovah; my horn has been exalted in Jehovah. My mouth has been enlarged over my enemies, because I have rejoiced in Your salvation.
No one is holy like Jehovah, for there is no one besides You, nor is there any rock like our God.
Talk no more so very proudly; let no arrogance come out of your mouth, for Jehovah is the Mighty God of knowledge; and by Him actions are weighed.
The bows of the mighty are broken, and those stumbling have been girded with strength.
Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, and the hungry have ceased to hunger. Even the barren has borne seven, and she who has many children has become feeble.
Jehovah kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and brings up.
Jehovah makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up.
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, to set them among princes and make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah’s, and He set the world upon them.
He guards the feet of His saints, but the wicked are silent in darkness. For man does not prevail by might.
The adversaries of Jehovah are broken in pieces; from the heavens He thunders against them. Jehovah judges the ends of the earth. He gives strength to His king, and exalts the horn of His anointed.
And Elkanah went to his house at Ramah, and the child served Jehovah before Eli the priest.
Now the sons of Eli were sons of wickedness; they did not know Jehovah.
And the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fleshhook in his hand while the flesh was boiling.
And he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and the priest would take for himself all that the fleshhook brought up. Thus they did in Shiloh to all Israel who came there.
Also, before they burned the fat with smoke, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, Give flesh for roasting to the priest, for he will not take boiled flesh from you, but raw.
And if the man said to him, It is time to burn the fat to make it smoke, then you may take as much as your soul desires; he would then answer him, No, but you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force.
Therefore the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah, for the men had spurned the offering of Jehovah.
But Samuel was serving before Jehovah, even as a boy, girded with a linen ephod.
Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him year after year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Jehovah give you seed from this woman for the petition which has been loaned unto Jehovah. And they went to their place.
And Jehovah visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew up with Jehovah.
Now Eli was very old; and he heard everything his sons did to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I am hearing of your evil dealings from all the people.
No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I am hearing. You cause the people of Jehovah to transgress.
If a man sins against man, God will judge him. But if a man sins against Jehovah, who shall intercede for him? Nevertheless they did not heed the voice of their father, because Jehovah desired to kill them.
And the boy Samuel grew in stature, and in favor both with Jehovah and men.
And a man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Have I not revealed to show Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?
Did I not choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer upon My altar, to burn incense, and to bear the ephod before Me? And did I not give to the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel?
Why do you kick at My sacrifice and at My offering which I have commanded for My dwelling place, and honor your sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel My people?
Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel says: I said indeed that your house and the house of your father would walk before Me forever. But now Jehovah says: Far be it from Me! For those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.
Behold, the days are coming that I will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s house, so that there shall not be an old man in your house.
And you shall see an adversary in My dwelling place, despite all the good which God did for Israel. And there shall not be an old man in your house for all time.
And any of your men whom I do not cut off from My altar shall be to consume your eyes and grieve your soul. And all the increase of your house shall die as young men.
And this shall be a sign to you that shall come upon your two sons, upon Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die, both of them.
Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who shall do according to what is in My heart and in My soul. I will build him a lasting house, and he shall walk before My anointed for all time.
And it shall come to pass that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and say, Please, join me to the priesthood, that I may eat a piece of bread.
And the boy Samuel served Jehovah before Eli. And the Word of Jehovah was rare in those days; visions were not breaking through.
And it came to pass at that time, while Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes had begun to grow dim that he could not see,
and the lamp of God had not yet gone out in the temple of Jehovah where the ark of God was, where Samuel was lying down,
that Jehovah called, Samuel. And he answered, Here am I!
And he ran to Eli and said, Here I am, for you called me. And he said, I have not called; go back and lie down. And he went and lay down.
And Jehovah called yet again, Samuel. So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for you called me. He answered, I have not called, my son; go back and lie down.
(Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, nor was the Word of Jehovah yet revealed to him.)
And Jehovah called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for you did call me. Then Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.
Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you shall say, Speak, Jehovah, for Your servant is listening. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
And Jehovah came and stood and called as at other times, Samuel! Samuel! And Samuel answered, Speak, for Your servant is listening.
And Jehovah said to Samuel: Behold, I am doing something in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.
In that day I shall carry out against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.
For I have declared to him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he has known, because his sons are being despicable, and he has not restrained them.
And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.
And Samuel lay down until morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel was afraid to make known the vision to Eli.
Then Eli summoned Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here I am.
And he said, What is the word that He has spoken to you? Please do not hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He has spoken to you.
And Samuel told him the matter, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah. Let Him do what is good in His eyes.
And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.
And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was being established as a prophet of Jehovah.
And Jehovah appeared again in Shiloh. For Jehovah revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the Word of Jehovah.
And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
And the Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined the battle, Israel was struck down before the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men at the battle line in the field.
And when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has Jehovah struck us down today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from Shiloh to us, that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies.
So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
And when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth shook.
And when the Philistines heard the sound of the shout, they said, What is this sound of great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews? Then they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp.
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp! And they said, Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before.
Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck Egypt with all the plagues in the wilderness.
Be strong and be like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be like men, and fight!
So the Philistines fought, and Israel was struck down, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
And a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and earth on his head.
And when he came, behold Eli was sitting on a seat by the wayside, watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and reported, all the city cried out.
When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, What is this sound of tumult? And the man came quickly and reported to Eli.
Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes had become set that he could not see.
And the man said to Eli, I am the one who came from the battle line, and I have fled today from the battle line. And he said, What happened, my son?
And the messenger answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, have died; and the ark of God has been taken.
And it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, due to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her pangs came upon her.
And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Do not fear, for you have borne a son. But she did not answer, nor was her heart set on it.
And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel! because the ark of God had been taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.
And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it next to Dagon.
And when those of Ashdod arose early the next day, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah. So they took Dagon and put him back on his place.
And when they arose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. The head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were broken off on the threshold; only Dagon’s torso was left to him.
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon those of Ashdod, and He ravaged them and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territories.
And when the men of Ashdod saw how it was, they said, The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand has been severe upon us and Dagon our god.
Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the rulers of the Philistines, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought to Gath. So they brought around the ark of the God of Israel.
And so it was, after they had brought it around, that the hand of Jehovah was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out on them.
Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!
So they sent and gathered together all the rulers of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people. For there was a death panic throughout all the city, because the hand of God had been very heavy there.
And the men who had not died were stricken with tumors, and the cry of the city went up to the heavens.
And the ark of Jehovah was in the land of the Philistines seven months.
And the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah? Make known to us how we shall send it to its place.
And they said, If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty; but turn it back to return it to Him with a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.
So they said, What is the trespass offering which we shall return to Him? And they answered, Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the rulers of the Philistines. For the same plague was upon all of you and upon your rulers.
Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your mice that are ruining the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lighten His hand from off you, from off your gods, and from off your land.
Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
Now therefore, make a new cart, take two milk cows which have never been yoked, and when you have tied the cows to the cart, take their calves home, away from them.
And take the ark of Jehovah and set it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a trespass offering in a chest by its side; and send it away, and let it go.
And watch: if it goes up the way to its own territory, to Beth Shemesh, then He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we shall know that it is not His hand that has struck us; it has happened to us by chance.
And the men did so: They took two milk cows and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.
And they set the ark of Jehovah on the cart, and the chest with the gold mice and the images of their tumors.
And the cows headed straight for the way to Beth Shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the rulers of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.
Now those of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
And the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; and a large stone was there. And they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering unto Jehovah.
And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah and the chest that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. And the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices that day unto Jehovah.
And when the five rulers of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a trespass offering unto Jehovah: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;
and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five rulers, both fortified cities and rural villages, even as far as the large stone of Abel on which they set the ark of Jehovah, which stone remains to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
And He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah. He struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people mourned because Jehovah had struck the people with a great slaughter.
And the men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?
And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath Jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah; come down and take it up with you.
And the men of Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of Jehovah, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Jehovah.
So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim many days; it was twenty years. And all the house of Israel mourned after Jehovah.
And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you are returning unto Jehovah with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts for Jehovah, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
So the children of Israel put away the Baals and Ashtaroth, and served Jehovah only.
And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Jehovah for you.
And they gathered together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out before Jehovah. And they fasted that day, and said there, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.
Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard of it, they were afraid before the Philistines.
And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Do not cease to cry out unto Jehovah our God for us, that He may deliver us out of the hand of the Philistines.
And Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering unto Jehovah. And Samuel cried out unto Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him.
And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But Jehovah thundered with a loud noise upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were smitten before Israel.
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car.
And Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, Thus far has Jehovah helped us.
So the Philistines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territories from the hands of the Philistines. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
And he went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places.
And he returned to Ramah, for his home was there. There he judged Israel, and there he built an altar unto Jehovah.
Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel.
The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beer-sheba.
But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
And all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,
and said to him, Behold, you have become old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint us a king to judge us like all the nations.
But the thing made Samuel’s eyes quiver when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Samuel, Consent to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, for Me to not reign over them.
According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day, with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods, so they are doing to you also.
Now therefore, consent to their voice. However, you shall solemnly testify to them, and inform them regarding the manner of the king who shall reign over them.
So Samuel told all the words of Jehovah to the people who were asking him for a king.
And he said, This shall be the manner of the king who shall reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for his own chariots and to be his horsemen, and some will run before his chariots.
He will appoint commanders over his thousands and commanders over his fifties, will set some to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and some to make his implements of war and equipment for his chariots.
He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
And he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants.
He will take a tenth of your seed and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants.
And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and make them do his work.
He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants.
And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and Jehovah will not answer you in that day.
Nevertheless the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but there shall be a king over us,
that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Samuel, Consent to their voice, and cause a king to reign over them. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Each of you go to his city.
Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.
And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the sons of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.
Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, Please, take one of the servants with you, and arise, go search for the donkeys.
And he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.
And when they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father leave the donkeys and become concerned about us.
And he said to him, Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and he is an honorable man; all that he speaks succeeds to come to pass. Now let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.
Then Saul said to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?
And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold, I have here at hand one fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.
(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: Come, let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)
Then Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.
And as they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
And they answered them and said, Yes, behold he is ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he has come to this city, because there is a sacrifice of the people today at the high place.
As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for today you will find him.
So they went up to the city; and as they were coming into the city, behold, Samuel was coming out to meet them, to go up to the high place.
Now Jehovah had revealed in Samuel’s ear the day before Saul came, saying,
Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may deliver My people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon My people, because their cry has come to me.
And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.
And Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Please tell me, where is the seer’s house?
And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will send you away and will declare to you all that is in your heart.
And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your heart on them, for they have been found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on you and on all your father’s house.
And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken this word to me?
And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place at the head of those who were invited; which were about thirty men.
And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it beside you.
And the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it before Saul. And he said, Behold here is what was reserved. Set it before you and eat; for until this appointed time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
And when they had come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul on the top of the house.
And they arose early; and it was about daybreak that Samuel summoned Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.
And as they were going down to the city limits, Samuel said to Saul, Command the servant to go on ahead of us. And he went on. But you stand here a moment, that I may proclaim to you the Word of God.
Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said: Is it not because Jehovah has anointed you ruler over His inheritance.
When you depart from me today, you will find two men by Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased speaking about the donkeys and has become concerned about you, saying, What shall I do about my son?
Then you shall go on farther and come to the plain of Tabor. There three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.
And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hands.
After that you shall come to the hill of God where the Philistine garrison is. And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying.
And the Spirit of Jehovah will rush upon you, and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man.
And let it be, when these signs come to you, that you do as your hand finds to do; for God is with you.
You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you shall do.
And so it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God changed him with another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day.
When they came there to the hill, there was a group of prophets to meet him; and the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied among them.
And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, What is this that has come upon the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
And a man from there answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb: Is Saul also among the prophets?
And when he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
And Saul’s uncle said to him and his servant, Where did you go? And he said, To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we came to Samuel.
And Saul’s uncle said, Please tell me what Samuel has said to you.
And Saul said to his uncle, He reported to make known to us that the donkeys had been found. But about the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said.
And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah at Mizpah,
and said to the children of Israel, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all kingdoms and from those oppressing you.
But you have today rejected your God, who Himself delivered you out of all your adversities and your afflictions; and you have said to Him, No, set a king over us! Now therefore, present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.
And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they sought him, he could not be found.
Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further, Has the man come here yet? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he is hiding himself among the equipment.
So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
And Samuel said to all the people, Do you see him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is no one like him among all the people? And all the people shouted and said, Long live the king!
Then Samuel explained to the people the ordinances of the king’s office, and wrote it in a book and set it before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and mighty men went with him, whose hearts God had touched.
But the sons of worthlessness said, How can this man deliver us? So they despised him, and brought him no gifts. But he kept silent.
Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.
And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition I will make a covenant with you, to bore out all your right eyes, and bring reproach on all Israel.
And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if there is no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.
So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke the words in the ears of the people. And all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
And behold, Saul was coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, What is with the people, that they weep? And they recounted to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
And the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger burned greatly.
And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen. And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people, and they came out as one man.
And when he numbered them at Bezek, the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
And they said to the messengers who came, Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance. And the messengers came and reported it to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever is good in your eyes.
So it was, the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
And the people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign over us? Set forth the men, that we may put them to death.
But Saul said, Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today Jehovah has worked deliverance in Israel.
And Samuel said to the people, Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.
And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal. There they slaughtered sacrifices of peace offerings before Jehovah, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
And Samuel said to all Israel: Behold, I have heeded your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.
And now, behold the king walking before you; and I am old and gray, and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth to this day.
Look at me. Witness against me before Jehovah and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I received any bribe with which to blind my eyes? I will restore it to you.
And they said, You have not cheated us nor oppressed us, nor have you taken anything from any man’s hand.
And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.
And Samuel said to the people, It is Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
Now therefore, present yourself, that I may plead with you before Jehovah concerning all the righteous acts of Jehovah which He did with you and your fathers:
When Jacob had gone into Egypt, and your fathers cried out unto Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place.
And when they forgot Jehovah their God, He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
And they cried out unto Jehovah, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah and served the Baals and Ashtaroth; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.
And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies all around; and you dwelt in safety.
And when you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us, even though Jehovah your God was your king.
Now therefore, behold the king whom you have chosen and whom you have asked for. And behold, Jehovah has set a king over you.
If you will fear Jehovah and serve Him and obey His voice, and do not rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, then both you and the king who reigns over you shall follow Jehovah your God.
However, if you do not obey the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, then the hand of Jehovah will be against you, as it was against your fathers.
Now therefore, present yourselves and see this great thing which Jehovah will do before your eyes:
Is today not the wheat harvest? I will call to Jehovah, and He will send thunder and rain, that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the eyes of Jehovah, to ask for a king for yourselves.
So Samuel called unto Jehovah, and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.
And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Jehovah your God, that we may not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for a king for ourselves.
And Samuel said to the people, Do not fear. You have done all this evil; yet do not turn aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart.
And do not turn aside to go after vanities which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are nothing.
For Jehovah will not abandon His people, for His great name’s sake, because Jehovah has undertaken to make you a people for Himself.
Moreover, as for me, far be it from me to sin against Jehovah to cease to pray for you; for I have taught you the good and the right way.
Only fear Jehovah, and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.
But if you do wickedly to do evil, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.
Saul was forty years old when he began to reign; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent each man to his tent.
And Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the shofar throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear!
And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel had also become odious to the Philistines. And the people were summoned after Saul at Gilgal.
And the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore for multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth Aven.
And when the men of Israel saw that they were in straits, for the people were distressed, then the people hid in caves, in crevices, in rocks, in holes, and in pits.
And some of the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, with all the people behind him, trembling.
And he waited seven days for Samuel, according to the appointed time; but Samuel had not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
So Saul said, Bring the burnt offering and peace offerings here to me. And he offered the burnt offering.
And it happened, as soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, to bless him.
And Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, When I saw that the people had scattered from me, and that you had not come at the appointed time, and that the Philistines were gathering together at Michmash,
then I said, The Philistines will now come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the face of Jehovah. Therefore I forced myself, and offered a burnt offering.
And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Jehovah your God, which He has commanded you. For now Jehovah would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
But now your kingdom shall not stand. Jehovah has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and Jehovah has ordained him to be ruler over His people, because you have not kept what Jehovah has commanded you.
And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people found with him, about six hundred men.
And Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people found with them remained at Gibeah of Benjamin; and the Philistines encamped at Michmash.
And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned toward the way to Ophrah, to the land of Shual,
another company turned toward the way to Beth Horon, and another company turned toward the way of the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
Now there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines thought, Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.
But all Israel would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle;
and the price for sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads.
So it came about, in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.
And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that was his armorbearer, Come, let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines that is on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
And Saul was sitting at the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men.
Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah at Shiloh, was wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
The one rock was a pillar northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.
And Jonathan said to the young man that was his armorbearer, Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that Jehovah will work for us; for nothing restrains Jehovah, to save by many or by few.
So his armorbearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart. Turn then; behold, I am with you according to your heart.
And Jonathan said, Behold, let us cross over to these men, and we will show ourselves to them.
If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you, then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them.
But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up, for Jehovah has delivered them into our hand; and this will be a sign to us.
So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden.
And the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will teach you something. And Jonathan said to his armorbearer, Come up after me, for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel.
And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet with his armorbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan. And his armorbearer followed, killing them.
That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within an area of land half the size that a yoke of oxen might plow in a day.
And there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was a very great trembling.
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold the multitude had melted away; and they went, striking down one another.
Then Saul said to the people who were with him, Number and see who has gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there.
And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring the ark of God here (for the ark of God was with the sons of Israel that day).
And it happened, while Saul spoke to the priest, that the roar in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.
And Saul and all the people with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and behold every man’s sword was against his neighbor, and there was very great confusion.
Moreover the Hebrews who had previously retreated from the Philistines into the surrounding areas, they also joined the camp of the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines had fled, they also pursued closely after them in the battle.
So Jehovah saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over to Beth Aven.
And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had placed the people under oath, saying, Cursed is the man who eats food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food.
Now all the people of the land came to a forest; and there was honey on the ground.
And when the people had come into the forest, there was the flowing honey; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.
Then one of the people said, Your father adjured the people with an oath, saying, Cursed is the man who eats food this day. And the people were faint.
And Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. See now, how my eyes have brightened because I have tasted a little of this honey.
How much better if the people had eaten to feed themselves today of the spoils of their enemies which they have found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
And they drove back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon; and the people were very faint.
And the people rushed upon the spoils, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate with the blood.
And they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people are sinning against Jehovah to eat with the blood! So he said, You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this moment.
And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me here each man his ox and his sheep, slaughter them here, and eat; and do not sin against Jehovah to eat with the blood. So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered it there.
And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah. This was the first altar that he built unto Jehovah.
And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever is good in your eyes. And the priest said, Let us draw near to God here.
And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel? But He did not answer him that day.
And Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today.
For as Jehovah lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall be executed to death. But not one of all the people answered him.
Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what is good in your eyes.
Therefore Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped.
And Saul said, Cast lots between my son Jonathan and me. And Jonathan was taken.
Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan confessed to him, and said, I have tasted to eat a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Behold, I must die!
And Saul answered, God do so and more also; for you shall be executed to death, Jonathan.
But the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Let it not be! As Jehovah lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.
Then Saul withdrew from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
So when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies all around: against Moab, against the sons of Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he condemned them.
And he dealt with might and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.
The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.
The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
And war with the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant youth, he gathered them to himself.
Samuel also said to Saul, Jehovah has sent me to anoint you king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I will punish Amalek for what he has done to Israel, how he had laid in wait for him on the way when he came up from Egypt.
Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.
So Saul gathered the people together and mustered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah.
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.
And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
And Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is before Egypt.
He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.
And the Word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,
I regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not carried out My words. And it angered Samuel, and he cried out to Jehovah all night.
And when Samuel arose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul has come to Carmel, and behold, he is setting up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.
And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, Blessed are you of Jehovah! I have carried out the Word of Jehovah.
And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice unto Jehovah your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
Then Samuel said to Saul, Be quiet! And I will tell you what Jehovah has said to me last night. And he said to him, Speak.
And Samuel said, When you were little in your own eyes, were you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not Jehovah anoint you king over Israel?
Now Jehovah sent you on a mission, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them to finish them off.
Why then have you not obeyed the voice of Jehovah? Why did you swoop down upon the spoils, and do evil in the eyes of Jehovah?
And Saul said to Samuel, But I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah, and gone on the mission to which Jehovah sent me, and brought back Agag the king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things, the devoted things, to sacrifice unto Jehovah your God in Gilgal.
And Samuel said: Has Jehovah as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in to obey the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.
For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the Word of Jehovah, He also has rejected you from being king.
And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the mouth of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and heeded their voice.
Now therefore, please forgive my sin, and return with me, that I may bow down before Jehovah.
And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you, for you have rejected the Word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected you from being king over Israel.
And as Samuel turned around to go away, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore.
And Samuel said to him, Jehovah has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.
And also the Emminence of Israel will not deal falsely nor repent. For He is not a man, to repent.
And he said, I have sinned; yet honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may bow down before Jehovah your God.
So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul bowed down before Jehovah.
Then Samuel said, Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me. So Agag came to him delighted; for Agag thought, Surely the bitterness of death has past.
But Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before Jehovah at Gilgal.
And Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.
And Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and Jehovah was sorry that He had made Saul king over Israel.
And Jehovah said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided Myself a king among his sons.
And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And Jehovah said, Take a heifer from the herd at your hand, and say, I have come to sacrifice unto Jehovah.
And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I say to you.
And Samuel did what Jehovah spoke, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled to meet him, and said, Do you come in peace?
And he said, In peace. I have come to sacrifice unto Jehovah. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
And it came about, when they came, that he looked at Eliab and thought, Surely the anointed of Jehovah is before Him.
But Jehovah said to Samuel, Do not look at his appearance nor at the height of his stature, because I have refused him. For man does not see as He sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks at the heart.
So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, Neither has Jehovah chosen this one.
Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah has not chosen these.
And Samuel said to Jesse, Are all the young men here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is grazing the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.
And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and good appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!
And Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of Jehovah rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
But the Spirit of Jehovah had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Jehovah had fallen upon him.
And Saul’s servants said to him, Behold, an evil spirit from God is overwhelming you.
Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek out a man who knows how to play the harp; and it shall be that he shall play it with his hand when the evil spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.
So Saul said to his servants, Look now for a man who can play well, and bring him to me.
Then one of the servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who knows how to play, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Jehovah is with him.
Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.
And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by his son David to Saul.
And David came to Saul and stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer.
And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my eyes.
And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp and played with his hand; and Saul was relieved and well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle, and were gathered together at Sochoh, which belongs to Judah; they encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephes Dammim.
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines.
The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.
And a man came out from the camp of the Philistines between the two armies, named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
He had a bronze helmet on his head, and he was wearing a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze.
And he had armor of bronze on his legs, and a bronze gorget between his shoulders.
The stock of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his iron spearhead weighed six hundred shekels; and a shield bearer went before him.
And he stood and called out to the ranks of Israel, and said to them, Why have you come out to be arrayed for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.
If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.
And the Philistine said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. And the man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men.
The three oldest sons of Jesse went out after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
David was the youngest, and the three oldest had gone after Saul.
And David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.
And the Philistine drew near and presented himself morning and evening, forty days.
And Jesse said to his son David, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp.
And carry these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of their thousand, and see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.
Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
And David arose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the battle line and shouting for the battle.
For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, rank against rank.
And David left the things in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and inquired after the welfare of his brothers.
And as he talked with them, behold the man came out from the ranks of the armies of the Philistines, between the two armies, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name; and he spoke according to the same words. And David heard.
And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were very much afraid.
And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who comes up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And it shall be that the man who kills him, the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free from taxes in Israel.
And David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the ranks of the living God!
And the people answered him in this manner, saying, Thus shall it be done for the man who kills him.
Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and your naughty heart, for you have come down to see the battle.
And David said, What have I done now? Was it not just words?
And he turned from him toward another and spoke the same words; and these people answered him according to the first words.
And when the words which David had spoken were heard, they were reported before Saul; and he sent for him.
And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant shall go and fight with this Philistine.
And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
And David said to Saul, Your servant was grazing his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,
I went out after it and struck it, and rescued the lamb out of its mouth; and when it arose against me, I took hold of it by its beard, and struck and killed it.
Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has reproached the ranks of the living God.
Moreover David said, Jehovah, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and Jehovah be with you!
And Saul clothed David with his garments, and he put a bronze helmet on his head, and clothed him with body armor.
And David girded his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them. And David took them off.
Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine.
And the Philistine proceeded to come near to David, with the man carrying the shield before him.
And when the Philistine considered and saw David, he disdained him; for he was only a youth, ruddy and of good appearance.
And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you are coming to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field!
Then David said to the Philistine, You are coming to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I am coming to you in the name of Jehovah of Hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, whom you have reproached.
This day Jehovah will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the heavens and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
Then all this assembly shall know that Jehovah does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is Jehovah’s, and He has given you into our hands.
So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hastened and ran toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.
Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their strong man was dead, they fled.
And the men of Israel and Judah rose up and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron.
And the sons of Israel returned from hotly pursuing the Philistines, and plundered their camps.
And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.
Now when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.
So the king said, Inquire whose son this young man is.
So when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
And Saul said to him, Lad, whose son are you? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return to his father’s house.
And Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
And Jonathan took off the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his garments, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.
And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was pleasing in the eyes of all the people and also in the eyes of Saul’s servants.
And it happened as they were coming, as David was returning from killing the Philistine, that the women came out from all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of the triad.
And the women responded as they played, and said: Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
And Saul was very furious, and the saying made his eyes quiver; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed only thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?
So Saul eyed David from that day forward.
And it happened on the next day that the evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house. So David played music with his hand, as at other times; and there was a spear in Saul’s hand.
And Saul threw the spear, for he thought, I will strike David to the wall! But David turned away from his presence twice.
And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, but had departed from Saul.
Therefore Saul removed him from being with him, and made him his commander over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and Jehovah was with him.
Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him.
But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
And Saul said to David, Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight the battles of Jehovah. For Saul thought, Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.
And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.
Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing was agreeable in his eyes.
And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David a second time, You shall be my son-in-law today.
And Saul commanded his servants, Speak with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delighted in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.
And Saul’s servants spoke those words in David’s ears. And David said, Is it a slight thing in your eyes to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing as how I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?
And the servants of Saul reported to him, saying, In this manner David has spoken.
And Saul said, Thus you shall say to David: The king does not desire any dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
And when his servants told David these words, the thing was agreeable in David’s eyes, to become the king’s son-in-law. And the day had not ended;
therefore David rose up and went out, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.
Thus Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him;
and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.
And the commanders of the Philistines went out to war. And so it was, whenever they went out, that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed.
And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted greatly in David; so Jonathan informed David, saying, My father Saul is seeking to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret place and hide.
And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you; and what I observe, I will inform you.
Thus Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works have been very good toward you.
For he took his soul in his own hands and killed the Philistine, and Jehovah brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then would you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?
So Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, As Jehovah lives, he shall not be killed.
And Jonathan called out to David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was before him as in times past.
And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and struck them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him.
And the evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing music with his hand.
And Saul sought to strike David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped away from Saul’s presence; and he struck the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night.
Saul also sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, informed him, saying, If you do not deliver your soul tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.
So Michal let David down through a window. And he went and fled and escaped.
And Michal took an image and laid it in the bed, put a quilt of goats’ hair at the head, and covered it with clothes.
So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
And Saul sent the messengers back to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, to kill him.
And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a quilt of goats’ hair at the head.
And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go! Why should I kill you?
So David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.
Now it was reported to Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah!
And Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing, stationed over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
And when it was reported to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.
Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is at Sechu. And he asked, and said, Where are Samuel and David? And someone said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. And the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan’s face, What have I done? What is my iniquity, and what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?
And Jonathan said to him, Let it not be! You shall not die! Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will disclose it in my ear. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!
And David swore and said, Your father has perceived to know that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But surely, as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death.
And Jonathan said to David, Whatever your soul desires, I will do it for you.
And David said to Jonathan, Behold tomorrow is the New Moon, and I should remain to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may hide in the field until the third evening.
If your father notices and misses me, then answer, David has asked for himself a leave of absence that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
If he says thus: Good, your servant will be safe. But if he burns with fury, then know that evil is determined by him.
Therefore you shall deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of Jehovah with you. However, if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?
And Jonathan said, Let it not be! For if I perceived to know that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?
Then David said to Jonathan, Who will tell me? Or what if your father answers you harshly?
And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. So both of them went out into the field.
And Jonathan said to David: Jehovah the God of Israel is witness! When I have searched out my father sometime tomorrow, or the third day, and there is good toward David, and I have not disclosed it in your ear,
may Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father to do you evil, then I will disclose it in your ear and send you away, that you may go in peace. And Jehovah be with you as He was with my father.
And you shall not only show me the kindness of Jehovah while I still live, that I not die;
but you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not even when Jehovah has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.
So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let Jehovah require it at the hand of David’s enemies.
And Jonathan again caused David to swear, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
And when you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel.
And I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target;
and there I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I answer to say to him, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; get them and come; then, as Jehovah lives, there is peace for you and nothing else.
But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way, for Jehovah has sent you away.
And as for the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold Jehovah is between you and me forever.
So David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.
Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan rose up, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.
Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, Something has happened to him; he is not clean, surely he is not clean.
And it happened the next day, the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?
And Jonathan answered Saul, David has asked for himself a leave of absence to go to Bethlehem.
And he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and thus my brother has commanded me. And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers. Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.
Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of perverse rebellion! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?
For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he is a son of death.
And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be killed? What has he done?
And Saul threw a spear at him to kill him, by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David.
So Jonathan rose up from the table in burning anger, and ate no food the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David, because his father had shamed him.
And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy was with him.
And he said to the boy, Now run, find the arrows which I am shooting. As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
When the boy had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called out after the boy and said, Is not the arrow beyond you?
And Jonathan called out after the boy, Make haste, hurry, do not delay! So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows and came back to his master.
But the boy did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter.
And Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.
And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose up from a place on the south side, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so.
And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of Jehovah, saying, May Jehovah be between you and me, and between your seed and my seed, forever. So he rose up and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.
And David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And Ahimelech trembled when he met David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no one is with you?
And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has charged me with some business, and said to me, Let no one know anything of the matter about which I am sending you, or what I have commanded you. And I have directed my young men to such and such a place.
Now therefore, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.
And the priest answered David and said, There is no common bread on hand; but there is holy bread, if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.
And David answered the priest, and said to him, Truly, women have been kept from us about three days since I came out. And the vessels of the young men are holy, and in a way the bread is common, even though it was consecrated in the vessel today.
So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the Bread of the Presence which had been taken from before Jehovah, in order to put hot bread in its place on the day when it was taken away.
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah. And his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.
And David said to Ahimelech, Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business came about urgently.
And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it. For there is no other except that one here. And David said, There is none like it; give it to me.
And David rose up and fled that day from the face of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
And the servants of Achish said to him, Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him in dances, saying: Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
And David took these words to heart, and was very much afraid before Achish the king of Gath.
And he changed his behavior in their eyes, acted like a mad man in their hands, scratched marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall into his beard.
Then Achish said to his servants, Behold, see how the man is mad. Why did you bring him to me?
Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this fellow to show madness in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?
David therefore departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam. And when his brothers and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
And everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was of a bitter soul gathered to him. So he became commander over them. And there were about four hundred men with him.
And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.
And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the days that David was in the stronghold.
And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah. So David departed and came into the forest of Hereth.
And when Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered (now Saul was staying in Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him);
then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
All of you have conspired against me, and not one is disclosing in my ear that my son made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and not one of you is sorry for me nor is disclosing in my ear that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day.
Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
And he inquired of Jehovah for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
So the king sent to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who were at Nob. And they all came to the king.
And Saul said, Listen now, son of Ahitub! And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
And Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise up against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?
And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in all your house?
Have I this day begun to inquire of God for him? Let it not be! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, or to any in the house of my father; for your servant has known nothing of all this, little or much.
And the king said, You shall be executed to death, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s house!
And the king said to the guards who stood about him, Turn and kill the priests of Jehovah, because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he was fleeing and did not disclose it in my ear. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priests of Jehovah.
And the king said to Doeg, You turn and fall upon the priests! And Doeg the Edomite turned and fell upon the priests, and killed on that day eighty-five men bearing a linen ephod.
Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep; with the edge of the sword.
Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
And Abiathar reported to David that Saul had killed the priests of Jehovah.
And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would report to inform Saul. I have brought about the death of all the souls of your father’s house.
Stay with me, do not fear; for he who seeks my soul seeks your soul; but with me you shall be safeguarded.
Then they reported to David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah, and they are plundering the threshing floors.
Therefore David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And Jehovah said to David, Go and strike the Philistines, and save Keilah.
And David’s men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?
So David inquired of Jehovah once again. And Jehovah answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah. For I am delivering the Philistines into your hand.
And David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines, struck them with a great slaughter, and led away their livestock. Thus David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
And it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, that he had come down with an ephod in his hand.
And it was reported to Saul that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, God has alienated him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.
And Saul summoned all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
But David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, and said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod here.
Then David said, O Jehovah the God of Israel, Your servant has heard to understand that Saul seeks to come to Keilah to destroy the city because of me.
Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Jehovah the God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down.
Then David said, Will the lords of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And Jehovah said, They will deliver you.
And David and his men, about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he left off to go.
And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in the mountains in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.
And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his soul. And David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a forest.
And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the forest and encouraged his hand in God.
And he said to him, Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. And my father Saul knows that.
And the two of them made a covenant before Jehovah. And David stayed in the forest, and Jonathan went to his house.
Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the forest, in the hill of Hachilah, which is south of the desert?
Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul. Come down, and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.
And Saul said, Blessed are you of Jehovah, for you have had compassion on me.
Please go and find out for sure, know and see the place where his feet are, and who has seen him there; for it has been said that he is crafty and shrewd.
See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I shall go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I shall search for him throughout all the thousands of Judah.
And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain to the south of the desert.
And when Saul and his men went to seek him, they reported it to David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
And Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were encircling David and his men to catch them.
But a messenger came to Saul, saying, Hasten and come, for the Philistines have raided the land!
Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape.
And David went up from there and dwelt in the strongholds at En Gedi.
Now it happened, when Saul had returned from going after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.
Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the mountain goats.
And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. And David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.
And David’s men said to him, This is the day of which Jehovah has said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as is pleasing in your eyes. And David arose and secretly cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe.
And it happened afterward that David’s heart smote him because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
And he said to his men, Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the anointed of Jehovah, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of Jehovah.
So David restrained his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul rose up from the cave and went on his way.
David also rose up afterward, went out of the cave, and called out after Saul, saying, My lord the king! And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and prostrated himself.
And David said to Saul: Why do you listen to the words of men who say, Behold David is seeking to hurt you?
Behold, this day your eyes have seen that Jehovah has delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and some had intended to kill you. But my eye spared you, and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.
Moreover, my father, look! Indeed, see the skirt of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, recognize and consider that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. And yet you are hunting my soul to take it.
Jehovah judge between you and me, and Jehovah avenge me of you. But my hand shall not be against you.
As the proverb of the ancients says, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked. But my hand shall not be against you.
After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom are you pursuing? After a dead dog? After a flea?
Therefore Jehovah is judge, and has judged between you and me, and shall see and plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.
And so it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
And he said to David: You are more righteous than I; for you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil.
And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when Jehovah had delivered me into your hand, you have not killed me.
For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away with good will? Therefore may Jehovah reward you with good for what you have done to me this day.
And now, behold, I know that you shall reign to be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
Therefore swear now to me by Jehovah that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.
And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.
And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered together and mourned for him, and buried him at his home at Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
And there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel, and the man was very great. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
The name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And she was a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance; but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings. And he was of the house of Caleb.
When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and when you have come to Nabal, and asked after his welfare in my name,
you shall say to him: Long life and peace to you, peace to your house, and peace to all that you have!
Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we have not hurt them, nor has there been anything missing from them all the days they were in Carmel.
Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let the young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on a pleasant day. Please give whatever your hand finds to your servants and to your son David.
And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.
And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants these days breaking away each one from his master.
Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?
So David’s young men turned around on their way, returned and came and reported to him all these words.
And David said to his men, Every man gird on his sword. So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went up after David, and two hundred stayed with the supplies.
Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David had sent messengers from the wilderness to bless our master; and he yelled at them.
But the men were very good to us, and we have not been shamed, nor have we missed anything all the days we have traversed with them, when we were in the fields.
They have been a wall to us both by night and day, all the days we were with them keeping the sheep.
Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he is a son of worthlessness, that no one can speak to him.
Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already done, five measures of roasted grain, one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys.
And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I am coming after you. But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
And so it was, as she rode on the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill; and behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; and she met them.
Now David had thought to himself, Surely in vain I have protected all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing has been missing of all that belongs to him. And he has repaid me evil for good.
God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I leave to him by morning light any of those who urinate against a wall.
Now when Abigail saw David, she hastened to dismount from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and prostrated to the ground.
And she fell at his feet and said: On me, my lord, on me be this iniquity! And please let your handmaid speak in your ears, and hear the words of your handmaid.
Please, let not my lord set his heart on this man of worthlessness, Nabal. For as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I, your handmaid, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.
Now therefore, my lord, as Jehovah lives and as your soul lives, since Jehovah has held you back from coming to blood and from delivering yourself with your own hand, now then, let your enemies and those who seek evil upon my lord be as Nabal.
And now this blessing which your handmaid has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who travel on foot with my lord.
Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid; for Jehovah will bring about to prepare an established house for my lord, because my lord is fighting the battles of Jehovah, and evil is not found in you all your days.
If a man arises to pursue you and seek your soul, the soul of my lord shall be bound up in the bundle of life with Jehovah your God; and the souls of your enemies He shall sling out, as from the pocket of a sling.
And it shall come to pass, when Jehovah has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you ruler over Israel,
that this will not be a matter of conscience, nor stumbling of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has delivered himself. But when Jehovah has dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.
And David said to Abigail: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!
And blessed is your discernment and blessed are you, because you have kept me this day from coming to blood and from delivering myself with my own hand.
For indeed, as Jehovah the God of Israel lives, who has kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hastened and come to meet me, surely by morning light there would not have been left to Nabal any who urinate against a wall!
So David received from her hand what she had brought to him, and said to her, Go up to your house in peace. Behold, I have heeded your voice and respected your face.
And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was exceedingly drunk; therefore she did not tell him a word, little or much, until morning light.
And it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, and his wife had informed him of these things, that his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.
And it came to pass, after about ten days, that Jehovah struck Nabal, and he died.
And when David heard that Nabal had died, he said, Blessed is Jehovah, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has kept His servant from evil! For Jehovah has returned the evil of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke to Abigail, to take her as his wife.
And when the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, David has sent us to you to take you to him for a wife.
And she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your handmaid, a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
And Abigail hurried and rose up and rode on a donkey, with five of her maidens going on foot; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; both of them were his wives.
And Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah, before the desert?
Then Saul rose up and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert, by the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
David therefore sent out spies, and knew for sure that Saul had come.
And David rose up and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. And Saul was lying within the entrenchment, with the people encamped all around him.
Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with you.
So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and behold Saul was lying down sleeping within the entrenchment, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people were lying all around him.
Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him with the spear, into the earth one time; and I will not strike him again.
And David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him; for who can stretch out his hand against the anointed of Jehovah, and be guiltless?
David said furthermore, As Jehovah lives, Jehovah shall strike him, or his day shall come to have died, or he shall go out to battle and will have perished.
Jehovah forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the anointed of Jehovah. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that are by his head, and let us go.
So David took the spear and the jug of water by Saul’s head, and they got away; and no man saw it or knew it or awoke. For they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them.
And David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, with a great distance between them.
And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Do you not answer, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you, calling out to the king?
And David said to Abner, Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.
This thing that you have done is not good. As Jehovah lives, you are sons of death, because you have not guarded your master, the anointed of Jehovah. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.
And Saul recognized David’s voice, and said, Is that your voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?
Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If Jehovah has stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if it is the sons of men, may they be cursed before Jehovah, for they have driven me out this day from joining in the inheritance of Jehovah, saying, Go, serve other gods.
So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of Jehovah. For the king of Israel has come out to seek a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.
Then Saul said, I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my soul was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have acted foolishly and erred exceedingly.
And David answered and said, Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it.
May Jehovah repay every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for Jehovah has delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the anointed of Jehovah.
And behold, as your soul has been magnified this day in my eyes, so let my soul be magnified in the eyes of Jehovah, and let Him deliver me out of all distress.
Then Saul said to David, May you be blessed, my son David! You shall bring about to do, and shall prevail to accomplish. So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.
And David thought in his heart, Now I shall perish one day at the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than that I should slip away to escape to the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me anymore in any part of Israel. Thus I shall escape out of his hand.
And David arose and crossed over with the six hundred men who were with him to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widowed wife.
And it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.
And David said to Achish, If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the land, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?
So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
Now the number of days that David dwelt in the land of the Philistines was a year and four months.
And David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. For those nations were the inhabitants of the land from antiquity, as you come to Shur, as far as the land of Egypt.
And whenever David struck the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing, and returned and came to Achish.
And Achish would say, Did you not make a raid today? And David would say, Against the southern area of Judah, or against the southern area of the Jerahmeelites, or against the southern area of the Kenites.
And David would save alive neither man nor woman, to come to Gath; thinking, Lest they should report on us, saying, Thus has David done. And this was his manner all the days he dwelt in the land of the Philistines.
And Achish believed David, thinking, He has made himself odious to be abhorrent to his people Israel; therefore he will be my servant forever.
Now it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for war, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, You recognize to understand that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.
And David said to Achish, Surely you know what your servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore I shall make you guard over my head all the days.
Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the fortunetellers out of the land.
And the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at Gilboa.
And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
And when Saul inquired of Jehovah, Jehovah did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by the prophets.
Then Saul said to his servants, Find me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En Dor.
And Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And he said, Please divine for me by necromancy, and bring up for me the one I shall say to you.
And the woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and fortunetellers from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my soul, to cause me to die?
And Saul swore to her by Jehovah, saying, As Jehovah lives, no punishment shall befall you for this thing.
Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up for you? And he said, Bring up Samuel.
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!
And the king said to her, Do not be afraid. What have you seen? And the woman said to Saul, I have seen a god-like one ascending out of the earth.
And he said to her, What is his appearance? And she said, An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed down with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.
And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and does not answer me anymore, either by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, to make known to me what I should do.
Then Samuel said: Why then do you ask me, seeing Jehovah has departed from you and is your enemy?
And Jehovah has done for Himself as He has spoken by my hand. For Jehovah has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David.
Because you have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah nor executed His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore Jehovah has done this thing to you this day.
Moreover Jehovah will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. Jehovah will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
Then Saul quickly fell full length on the ground, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.
And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was exceedingly terrified, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you have spoken to me.
Now therefore, please, also listen the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way.
But he refused and said, I will not eat. So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice; and arose from the ground and sat on the bed.
Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it.
And she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.
Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies at Aphek, and Israel encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
And the rulers of the Philistines were passing over by the hundreds and thousands. And David and his men were passing over at the rear with Achish.
Then the commanders of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines, Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days and years? And to this day I have found no fault in him since he defected to me.
But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; so the commanders of the Philistines said to him, Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he make himself pleasing to his master, if not with the heads of these men?
Is this not David, of whom they sang in dances, saying: Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
Then Achish summoned David and said to him, Surely, as Jehovah lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the army is good in my eyes. For to this day I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless you are not pleasing in the eyes of the rulers.
Therefore now, return and go in peace, that you may not do evil in the eyes of the rulers of the Philistines.
And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant as I have been before you to this day, that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are as good in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
Now therefore, rise up early in the morning with your master’s servants who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.
So David and his men arose early in the morning to depart, to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
Now it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had raided the south and Ziklag, struck Ziklag and burned it with fire,
and had taken captive the women and those who were there, from small to great; they did not kill anyone, but carried them away and went their way.
So David and his men came into the city, and behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.
Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their voices and wept, until they had no more strength to weep.
And David’s two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite, had been taken captive.
And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the souls of all the people had become bitter, every man for his sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.
And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, Please bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? Shall I overtake them? And He answered him, Pursue, for you shall reach to overtake them, and rescue to recover all.
So David went, he and the six hundred men with him, and came to the Brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.
But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who had become too exhausted to cross over the Brook Besor.
And they found a man from Egypt in the field, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they let him drink water.
And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. So when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had eaten no bread nor drunk water for three days and three nights.
And David said to him, To whom do you belong, and where are you from? And he said, I am a young man from Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me behind, because three days ago I fell sick.
We had raided the southern area of the Cherethites, in the territory of Judah, and the southern area of Caleb; and we had burned Ziklag with fire.
And David said to him, Can you bring me down to this troop? So he said, Swear to me by God that you will neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.
And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread out over the face of the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoils which they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.
And David struck them from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.
And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David rescued his two wives.
And nothing of theirs was lacking, either small or great, sons or daughters, spoils or anything which they had taken from them; David brought back all.
And David took all the flocks and herds they had driven before those other livestock, and said, This is David’s spoils.
And David came to the two hundred men who had become too exhausted to go after David, whom they also had made to stay at the Brook Besor. So they went out to meet David and to meet the people with him. And when David came near the people, he asked after their welfare.
Then all the wicked and worthless men of those who went with David answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoils that we have recovered, except for every man’s wife and children, that they may lead them away and depart.
But David said, My brethren, you shall not do so with what Jehovah has given to us, who has preserved us and delivered into our hand the troop that came against us into our hand.
For who will heed you in this matter? But as his part is who goes down to the battle, so shall his part be who stays by the supplies; they shall share together.
So it was, from that day forward; he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
And when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoils to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Here is a present for you from the spoils of the enemies of Jehovah;
to those in Bethel, to those in Ramoth of the South, to those in Jattir,
to those in Aroer, to those in Siphmoth, to those in Eshtemoa,
to those in Rachal, to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, to those in the cities of the Kenites,
to those in Hormah, to those in Chorashan, to those in Athach,
to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men had traversed.
Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines closely pursued Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.
The battle was heavy against Saul; and the shooting of the archers found him, and he was writhing with exceeding pain from the shooting of the archers.
And Saul said to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and fell on it.
And when his armorbearer saw that Saul had died, he also fell on his sword, and died with him.
So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that day.
And when the men of Israel on the other side of the valley, and those on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent word throughout the land of the Philistines, to proclaim it in the house of their idols and among the people.
And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth Shan.
And when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
all the valiant men rose up and traveled all night, and took the corpse of Saul and the corpses of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and burned them there.
And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David remained two days in Ziklag,
that on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and earth on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.
And David said to him, Where have you come from? So he said to him, I have escaped from the camp of Israel.
And David said to him, How did the matter go? Please tell me. And he answered, The people have fled from the battle, many of the people have fallen and died, and Saul and Jonathan his son have died.
And David said to the young man who told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son have died?
And the young man who told him said, As I happened by chance to be on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen closely pursued him.
And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.
And he said to me, Who are you? So I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
He said to me again, Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my soul still remains in me.
So I stood over him and killed him, because I perceived that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.
Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and so did all the men with him.
And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the people of Jehovah and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
Then David said to the young man who told him, Where are you from? And he answered, I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.
And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the anointed of Jehovah?
And David summoned one of the young men and said, Go near, and fall upon him! And he struck him so that he died.
And David said to him, Your blood is on your own head, for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have killed the anointed of Jehovah.
Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,
and he commanded them to teach the sons of Judah the Song of the Bow; behold, it is written in the Book of Jasher:
The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places! How the mighty have fallen!
Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for the shield of the mighty has been rejected as loathsome there! The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan has not turned back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.
Saul and Jonathan were beloved and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they have not been separated. They have been swifter than eagles, they have been stronger than lions.
O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with luxury; who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.
How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan, slain on your high places.
I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been very pleasant to me; your love to me was wonderful, surpassing the love of women.
How the mighty have fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
It happened after this that David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. David said, Where shall I go up? And He said, To Hebron.
So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
And David brought up the men who were with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabesh Gilead were the ones who buried Saul.
So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, You are blessed of Jehovah, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him.
And now may Jehovah show kindness and truth to you. I also will deal kindly with you, because you have done this thing.
Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.
But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim;
and he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.
And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and make sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David.
And each one grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Swords, which is in Gibeon.
And the battle was fierce that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were smitten before the servants of David.
Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel was as fleet of foot as a gazelle in the field.
And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from after Abner.
Then Abner looked behind him and said, Are you Asahel? He answered, I am.
And Abner said to him, Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his spoils for yourself. But Asahel would not turn aside from after him.
And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from after me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then shall I lift up my face to your brother Joab?
However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the back end of the spear, so that the spear came out his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
Joab and Abishai also pursued after Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which is before Giah by the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
And the sons of Benjamin gathered together after Abner and became one band, and took their stand on top of a hill.
Then Abner called to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to turn back from after their brethren?
And Joab said, As God lives, unless you had spoken, surely then by morning the people would have gone up, every one after his brother.
So Joab blew a shofar; and all the people stood still and did not pursue after Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore.
And Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.
And Joab returned from pursuing after Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel.
But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died.
And they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak.
Now there was long warfare between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
And sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widowed wife of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;
the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;
and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.
And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?
Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman?
May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as Jehovah has sworn to him;
to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba.
And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.
And Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring around all Israel to you.
And David said, Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I am asking of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.
And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
And Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.
And her husband went along with her to Bahurim, weeping behind her. And Abner said to him, Go, return. And he returned.
And the words of Abner had come to the elders of Israel, saying, In time past you were desiring David as king over you.
Now then, do it! For Jehovah has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies.
And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin. And Abner also went to speak in the ears of David at Hebron all that was good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.
So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
And behold the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoils with them. And Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
And when Joab and all the troops that were with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner has come to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.
Then Joab came to the king and said, What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you sent him away, and he has left to go?
You realize that Abner the son of Ner has come to deceive you, to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.
And when Joab had left David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.
And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of Asahel his brother.
And afterward, when David heard it, he said, My kingdom and I are guiltless before Jehovah forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
May it whirl about on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.
So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
And David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, Tear your clothes, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And King David walked behind the coffin.
And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
And the king lamented over Abner and said: Should Abner die the death of a fool?
Your hands were not bound nor your feet put into fetters; as a man falls before wicked men, so you have fallen. Then all the people wept over him again.
And when all the people came to give David food to eat while it was still day, David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down!
And all the people took note of it, and it was good in their eyes, even as whatever the king had done was good in the eyes of all the people.
For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been from the king, to kill Abner the son of Ner.
And the king said to his servants, Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?
And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too severe for me. Jehovah shall repay the evildoer according to his evil.
When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his hands fell limp, and all Israel was dismayed.
Now Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of troops. The name of one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin. (For Beeroth also was part of Benjamin,
because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and are sojourning there to this day.)
And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was lame in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon.
And when they had come there, into the middle of the house, as though carrying wheat, they stabbed him in the stomach. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
Now when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain.
And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, who had sought your life. Jehovah has requited vengeance for my lord the king this day upon Saul and his seed.
But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my soul from all distress,
when someone told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good news, I took him and killed him in Ziklag; the reward I gave him for his news.
How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?
And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, cut off their hands and feet, and hung them by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.
Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were the one leading Israel out and bringing them in; and Jehovah said to you, You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.
So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before Jehovah. And they anointed David king over Israel.
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
And the king and his men went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you, thinking, David cannot come in here.
Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. It is the City of David.
And David said on that day, Whoever climbs up by way of the water conduit let him strike down the Jebusites, the lame and the blind, who are hated by David’s soul. Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the City of David. And David built all around from the fortifications and inward.
And David went on and became great, and Jehovah the God of Hosts was with him.
And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and craftsmen and masons. And they built David a house.
Thus David recognized that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted His kingdom for His people Israel.
And David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David.
And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard of it and went down to the stronghold.
The Philistines also went and spread themselves out in the Valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up, for I will deliver up to give the Philistines into your hand.
So David went to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken through my enemies before me, like water bursting forth. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
And they abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them away.
Then the Philistines went up again and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of Jehovah, and He said, You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.
And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, that you shall be decisive. For then Jehovah shall have gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.
And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and he struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.
Again David gathered all the choice men of Israel, thirty thousand.
And David rose up and went, and all the people who were with him from Baale Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of Jehovah of Hosts, who dwells between the cherubim.
And they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.
They brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God; and Ahio was going before the ark.
And David and all the house of Israel were making sport before Jehovah with all manner of fir wood; with harps, with lutes, with tambourines, with rattles and buzzing.
And when they came to Nachon’s threshing floor, Uzzah stretched out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen had fallen.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his error; and he died there by the ark of God.
And David was furious because Jehovah had used violence and burst forth against Uzzah; thus the name of the place is called Perez Uzzah to this day.
And David was afraid of Jehovah that day; and he said, How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me?
So David was not willing to remove the ark of Jehovah to himself into the City of David; but David turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his house.
And it was reported to King David, saying, Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness.
And so it was, when those bearing the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, that he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
And David was dancing before Jehovah with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar.
And as the ark of Jehovah was coming into the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before Jehovah; and she despised him in her heart.
And they brought the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place in the midst of the tent that David had erected for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah.
And when David finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of Hosts.
And he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a cake of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins. And all the people departed, everyone to his house.
Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, uncovering himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the worthless fellows uncovers to reveal himself!
And David said to Michal, It was before Jehovah, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel. Therefore I have danced before Jehovah.
And I have been even more lightly esteemed than this, and humble in my own eyes. But as for the handmaids of whom you have spoken, by them I was honored.
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house, and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies all around,
that the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is dwelling inside tent curtains.
And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart, for Jehovah is with you.
And it happened that night that the Word of Jehovah came to Nathan, saying,
Go and say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah: Would you build a house for Me to dwell in?
For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle.
Wherever I have moved about with all the children of Israel, have I spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?
Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I have taken you from the pastures, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel.
And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who are on the earth.
Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, without being disturbed; nor shall the sons of unrighteousness afflict them anymore, as before,
since the day that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. And Jehovah has declared to you that He will make you a house.
When your days are fulfilled and you have rested with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of men.
But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.
According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.
Then King David went in and sat before Jehovah; and he said: Who am I, O Lord Jehovah? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord Jehovah; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come. Is this the manner of man, O Lord Jehovah?
Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord Jehovah, have known Your servant.
Because of Your Word, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know them.
Therefore You have been magnified, O Lord Jehovah. For there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God has gone to redeem as a people for Himself, to make a name for Himself; and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods?
For You established Your people Israel unto Yourself as Your own people forever; and You, Jehovah, have become their God.
Now, O Jehovah God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have spoken.
And let Your name be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of Hosts is the God over Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.
For You, O Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, have disclosed this in Your servant’s ear, saying, I will build you a house. Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You.
And now, O Lord Jehovah, You are God, and Your Words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You; for You, O Lord Jehovah, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever.
After this it came to pass that David struck the Philistines and subdued them. And David took control of the mother city from the hand of the Philistines.
And he struck Moab, made them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a line. With two lines he measured off those to be put to death, and with one full line those to be kept alive. Thus the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought tribute.
David also struck Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his hand at the River Euphrates.
And David captured seventeen hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots.
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand men of Syria.
And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David wherever he went.
And David took the shields of gold that had belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
Also from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a large amount of bronze.
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck down all the army of Hadadezer,
then Toi sent Joram his son to King David, to ask after his peace and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi); and Joram brought in his hand articles of silver, articles of gold, and articles of bronze.
King David also consecrated these to Jehovah, along with the silver and gold that he had consecrated from all the nations which he had subdued;
from Syria, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, from Amalek, and from the spoils of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
And David made a name for himself when he returned from killing eighteen thousand Syrians in the Valley of Salt.
He also put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And Jehovah gave victory to David wherever he went.
Thus David reigned over all Israel; and David was executing justice and righteousness to all his people.
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests; Seraiah was the scribe;
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief ministers.
Then David said, Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
And there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba. So when they summoned him to David, the king said to him, Are you Ziba? And he said, At your service!
And the king said, Is there not still someone of the house of Saul, to whom I may show the kindness of God? And Ziba said to the king, There is still a son of Jonathan who is lame in his feet.
And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.
Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.
And when Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold your servant!
And David said to him, Do not fear, for I will bring about to deal with you in kindness because of Jonathan your father, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.
He bowed again, and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I?
And the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, I have given to your master’s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s son shall eat bread at my table continually. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
And Ziba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so shall your servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table like one of the king’s sons.
And Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king’s table. And he was lame in both his feet.
It happened after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.
And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. So David sent by the hand of his servants to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
And the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, In your eyes, does David honor your father in sending comforters to you? Has David not sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.
And when they reported it to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.
And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot soldiers; and from the king of Maacah one thousand men, and from Ish-Tob twelve thousand men.
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
And the sons of Ammon came out and set themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate. And the Syrians of Zoba, Beth Rehob, Ish-Tob, and Maachah were by themselves in the field.
And when Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s choicest and set them in battle array to meet the Syrians.
And the rest of the people he put into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might set them in battle array to meet the sons of Ammon.
Then he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall deliver me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to deliver you.
Be strong, and let us be courageous for our people and for the cities of our God. And may Jehovah do what is good in His eyes.
So Joab and the people with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fleeing, they also fled before Abishai, and entered the city. So Joab returned from the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.
And when the Syrians saw that they had been struck down before Israel, they gathered together.
And Hadadezer sent and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River, and they came to Helam. And Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them.
And when it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in battle array to meet David and fought with him.
And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred in chariots and forty thousand horsemen of the Syrians, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.
And when all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they had been smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
And it happened in the spring of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
And it happened at night time, that David arose from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king’s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very pleasant in appearance.
And David sent and inquired after the woman. And someone said, Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her. And when she was sanctified from her uncleanness, she returned to her house.
And the woman conceived; and sent and reported to David, and said, I am with child.
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
And when Uriah came to him, David asked after Joab’s welfare, and the people’s welfare, and the progress of the war.
And David said to Uriah, Go down to your house and wash your feet. So Uriah departed from the king’s house, and a portion of food from the king followed him.
But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
So when they reported to David, saying, Uriah did not go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Did you not come from a journey? Why have you not gone down to your house?
And Uriah said to David, The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped on the face of the land. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
And David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you away. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
And when David summoned him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the strongest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.
So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men.
And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
And Joab sent and reported to David all the things concerning the war,
and charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished speaking of the matters of the war to the king,
if it happens that the king’s wrath arises, and he says to you: Why did you approach so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Uriah the Hittite has died also.
So the messenger went, and came and reported to David all that Joab had sent by him.
And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we were upon them as far as the entrance of the gate.
And the archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the king’s servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite has also died.
And David said to the messenger, Thus you shall say to Joab: Do not let this thing cause your eye to quiver, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen the battle against the city, and overthrow it. And encourage him.
When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband had died, she mourned for her husband.
And when her mourning was passed, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done caused the eyes of Jehovah to quiver.
And Jehovah sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.
The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.
But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him.
And a traveler came to the rich man, who spared to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.
And David’s anger burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, As Jehovah lives, the man who has done this is a son of death!
And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he has done this thing and because he had no pity.
And Nathan said to David, You are the man! Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.
I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you this and that!
Why have you despised the Word of Jehovah, to do evil in His eyes? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up evil against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the eyes of the sun.
For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.
And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah. And Nathan said to David, Jehovah also has put away your sin; you shall not die.
However, because of this matter in which you have caused contempt, for Jehovah to be spurned by His enemies, the child also who is born to you shall die the death.
And Nathan departed to his house. And Jehovah struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and it became sick.
David therefore besought God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.
And the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.
And on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child had died. For they said, Behold, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child has died? He may do some harm!
But when David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child had died. Therefore David said to his servants, Has the child died? And they said, He has died.
So David rose up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.
Then his servants said to him, What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child had died, you arose and ate food.
And he said, While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, Who knows whether Jehovah will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Now Jehovah loved him,
and He sent word by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of Jehovah.
Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and captured the royal city.
And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and I have captured the city of waters.
Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and lay siege against the city and take it, lest I capture the city and it be called after my name.
So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and captured it.
And he took their king’s crown from his head. Its weight was a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city in great abundance.
And he brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over into the brick kiln. Thus he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
After this Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she was a virgin; and it was difficult in Amnon’s eyes to do anything to her.
But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Now Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
And he said to him, Why are you, the king’s son, so low morning after morning? Will you not tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
So Jonadab said to him, Lie down on your bed and make yourself sick. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food before my eyes, that I may see it and eat it from her hand.
So Amnon lay down and made himself sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let Tamar my sister come and make a couple of cakes for me before my eyes, that I may eat from her hand.
And David sent to the house for Tamar, saying, Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded it, made cakes before his eyes, and baked the cakes.
And she took the pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have everyone go out from me. And they all went out from him.
And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the inner room, that I may eat from your hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to Amnon her brother in the inner room.
And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this disgraceful thing!
And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.
However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he forced her and lay with her.
Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise and go!
And she said to him, For what reason? This evil to send me away is worse than the other that you have done to me. But he would not listen to her.
Then he summoned his servant who attended him, and said, Send this woman out away from me, and bolt the door behind her.
And she had on a tunic of many colors, for the king’s virgin daughters wore such robes. And his servant brought her outside and bolted the door behind her.
And Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her tunic of many colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head and went away, crying out as she went.
And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister. He is your brother; do not take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
But when King David heard of all these things, he was extremely furious.
And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad. For Absalom hated Amnon, because he had humbled his sister Tamar.
And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is near Ephraim; and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.
But the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you. And he pressed him, but he would not go, but blessed him.
Then Absalom said, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?
But Absalom pressed him; so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Watch now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Strike Amnon! then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.
And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. And all the king’s sons arose, and each one got on his mule and fled.
And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!
So the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
Then Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon has died. For at the mouth of Absalom this has been determined since the day that he humbled his sister Tamar.
Now therefore, let not my lord the king take this word to heart, to think that all the king’s sons have died; for only Amnon has died.
Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the way along the hillside behind him.
And Jonadab said to the king, Look! The king’s sons have come; according to your servant’s word, so it is.
So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold the king’s sons came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.
But Absalom had fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
So Absalom had fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been comforted concerning Amnon, because he had died.
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman, and said to her, Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning apparel; do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead.
Go to the king and speak to him in this manner. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and prostrated herself, and said, Help, O king!
And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she answered, Truly I am a widow and my husband is dead.
And your handmaid had two sons; and the two fought with each other in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one struck the other and killed him.
And now the whole family has risen up against your handmaid, and said, Deliver him who struck his brother, that we may execute him for the soul of his brother whom he killed; and we will destroy the heir also. Thus they would extinguish my ember that is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the face of the earth.
And the king said to the woman, Go to your house, and I will give command concerning you.
And the woman of Tekoa said to the king, My lord, O king, let the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house, and the king and his throne be guiltless.
And the king said, Whoever says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall not touch you anymore.
And she said, Please let the king remember Jehovah your God, and do not permit the avenger of blood to destroy anymore, that they not destroy my son. And he said, As Jehovah lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground.
Then the woman said, Please, let your handmaid speak another word to my lord the king. And he said, Speak.
And the woman said: Why then have you devised such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this thing as one who is guilty, in that the king does not bring his banished one home again.
For we die the death and are like water poured on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not take away a soul; but has devised plans, so that His banished ones are not thrust away from Him.
Now therefore, I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. And your handmaid thought, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will carry out the word of his handmaid.
For the king will hear and deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
And your handmaid thought, The word of my lord the king will now be comforting; for as the angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil. And Jehovah your God be with you.
Then the king answered and said to the woman, Please do not hide from me anything that I am asking you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king speak.
So the king said, Is the hand of Joab with you in all this? And the woman answered and said, As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab has commanded me, and he has put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.
In order to change around the face of this matter your servant Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.
And the king said to Joab, Behold, I have done this thing. Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.
And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself, and blessed the king. And Joab said, Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, O king, in that the king has done the word of his servant.
So Joab rose up and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
And the king said, Let him return to his own house, but he shall not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, but did not see the king’s face.
Now in all Israel there was no one as handsome as Absalom, and highly praised. From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
And when he shaved his head (at the end of a year of days he shaved it because it was heavy on him; therefore he shaved it), he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels according to the king’s weight stones.
And to Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar. She was a woman of beautiful appearance.
And Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and did not see the king’s face.
Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him. And when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
So he said to his servants, Behold, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
Then Joab arose and came to Absalom’s house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come here, so that I may send you to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still. Now therefore, let me see the king’s face; but if there is iniquity in me, let him put me to death.
So Joab went to the king and reported to him. And when he had summoned Absalom, he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
After this it happened that Absalom provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
And Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. And so it was, whenever anyone who had a dispute came to the king for judgment, that Absalom would call to him and say, What city are you from? And he would say, Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.
Then Absalom would say to him, Behold, your case is good and right; but there is no one from the king to hear you.
Moreover Absalom would say, Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has a dispute or case could come to me, and I would give him justice.
And so it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he put out his hand and took him and kissed him.
In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. Thus Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
And it came to pass after forty years that Absalom said to the king, Please, let me go to Hebron and pay the vow which I have vowed unto Jehovah.
For your servant has vowed a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, If Jehovah brings me back to Jerusalem, then I shall serve Jehovah.
And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.
But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, then you shall say, Absalom is king in Hebron!
And with Absalom went two hundred men invited from Jerusalem, and they went along innocently and did not know anything.
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people with Absalom continually increased.
And a messenger came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom.
And David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; or we shall not escape before Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
And the king’s servants said to the king, We are your servants, ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.
And the king went out with all his household at his feet. But the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.
And the king went out with all the people at his feet, and stopped at the last house of the settlement.
And all his servants passed before him; and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, were passing on before the king.
Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why are you also going with us? Return to your place and remain with the king. For you are a foreigner and also an exile.
You came only recently. Should I make you go here and there with us this day, since I am going wherever I can? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth be with you.
And Ittai answered the king and said, As Jehovah lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.
And David said to Ittai, Go, and cross over. Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who were with him crossed over.
And all the land was weeping with a loud voice, and all the people were crossing over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the wilderness.
And behold Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over out of the city.
And the king said to Zadok, Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Jehovah, He will bring me back and show me both it and His dwelling place.
But if He says thus: I have not delighted in you, then behold, here am I, let Him do to me as is good in His eyes.
The king also said to Zadok the priest, Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
See, I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to report to me.
Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.
And David went up by the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up; and he had his head covered and was going barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went up.
And someone reported to David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Jehovah, I pray, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!
And it happened when David had come to the top of the mountain, where he bowed down before God, that behold Hushai the Archite was coming to meet him with his tunic torn and earth on his head.
And David said to him, If you go on with me, then you will become a burden to me.
But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I was your father’s servant previously, so I will now also be your servant, then you may frustrate the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
And do you not have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be that whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by their hands you shall send to me everything you hear.
So Hushai, David’s friend, went into the city. And Absalom came into Jerusalem.
And when David was a little past the top of the mountain, behold Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
And the king said to Ziba, What do you mean by these? And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.
And the king said, And where is your master’s son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.
Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, all that belongs to Mephibosheth is yours. And Ziba said, I prostrate before you, that I may find favor in your eyes, my lord, O king!
And when King David came to Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came.
And he pelted David and all the servants of King David with stones. And all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: Get out! Get out, you man of blood, you worthless man!
Jehovah has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Jehovah has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you are caught in your own evil, because you are a man of blood!
Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!
But the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because Jehovah has said to him, Curse David. Who then shall say, Why have you done so?
And David said to Abishai and all his servants, See how my son who came from my own body seeks my life; so, why not this Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for thus Jehovah has commanded him.
It may be that Jehovah will look on my affliction, and that Jehovah will repay me with good for his cursing this day.
And as David and his men went along the way, Shimei went along the hillside across from him and cursed as he went, pelted him with stones and kicked up dust.
And the king and all the people with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.
Meanwhile Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, had come to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel with him.
And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Long live the king! Long live the king!
And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why have you not gone with your friend?
And Hushai said to Absalom, No, but whom Jehovah and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I shall remain.
Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve before his son? As I have served before your father, so shall I be before your face.
And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel as to what we shall do.
And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you have become odious to your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.
So they spread out a tent for Absalom on the housetop, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines before the eyes of all Israel.
Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if one had inquired at the Word of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I shall arise and pursue David tonight.
I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and make him afraid. And all the people who are with him will flee, and I will strike only the king.
Then I shall bring back all the people to you. When all return, except the man whom you seek, all the people shall be at peace.
And the words were agreeable to the eyes of Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
And Absalom said, Now call Hushai the Archite also, and we shall hear from his mouth.
And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel has spoken according to these words. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.
And Hushai said to Absalom: The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.
For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are bitter of soul, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
Behold now, he is hidden in some pit, or in some other place. And it will be, when some of them fall at first, that whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.
And even he who is valiant, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will faint and melt away. For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and those who are with him are valiant men.
Therefore I counsel that all Israel be assembled and gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, like the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.
Thus we shall come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we shall fall upon him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we shall pull it into the river, until there is not one pebble found there.
So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For Jehovah had purposed to frustrate the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Jehovah might bring calamity upon Absalom.
And Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, Thus and so has Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have counseled.
Now therefore, send quickly and report to David, saying, Do not spend the night by the fords of the plains of the wilderness, but quickly cross over, that the king and all the people with him not be swallowed up.
Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a slave girl came and reported to them, and they went and reported to King David.
Nevertheless a lad saw them, and reported to Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it.
And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not discovered.
And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They have crossed over the water brook. And when they had searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and reported to King David, and said to David, Arise and cross over the water quickly; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.
So David and all the people with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not crossed over the Jordan.
And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not carried out, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city, put his house in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father’s tomb.
Then David went to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
And Absalom set Amasa over the army instead of Joab. This Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
And it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the children of Ammon, Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, roasted grain and beans, lentils and roasted seeds,
honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him to eat. For they said, The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.
And David mustered the people who were with him, and appointed commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds over them.
And David sent out one third of the people under the hand of Joab, one third under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and one third under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I shall proceed to go out with you myself also.
But the people answered, You shall not go out! For if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us; for you are like ten thousand of us now. You are now more help to us in the city.
And the king said to them, I will do what is good in your eyes. So the king stood beside the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
And the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom. And all the people heard when the king charged the commanders concerning Absalom.
So the people went out into the field to meet Israel. And the battle was in the forest of Ephraim.
The people of Israel were smitten there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand.
And the battle was scattered over the face of all the land, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword had devoured.
And Absalom was encountered before the servants of David. Absalom was riding on a mule, the mule went under the thick boughs of a great terebinth tree, and his head caught in the terebinth; so he was left hanging between the heavens and earth; and the mule which was under him went on.
And a certain man saw it and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth tree!
And Joab said to the man who reported to him, Behold, you have seen; and why did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten shekels of silver and a belt.
And the man said to Joab, Though I were to receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, I would not put forth my hand against the king’s son. For in our ears the king charged you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take heed that no one touches the young man Absalom!
Otherwise I would have dealt falsely against my own soul. For there is nothing hidden from the king, and you yourself would have set yourself against me.
And Joab said, I cannot wait before you. And he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through Absalom’s heart, while he was still alive in the midst of the terebinth tree.
And ten young men who bore Joab’s armor surrounded Absalom, and struck and killed him.
And Joab blew the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing Israel. For Joab had held back the people.
And they took Absalom and cast him into a large pit in the forest, and laid a very large heap of stones over him. And all Israel fled, everyone to his tent.
Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up a pillar for himself, which is in the King’s Valley; for he thought, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. He called the pillar after his own name. And to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.
Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run now and bear good news to the king, how Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies.
And Joab said to him, You are not the man for tidings this day, but you shall bear good news another day. But today you shall not bear good news, because the king’s son is dead.
Then Joab said to Cushi, Go, tell the king what you have seen. So Cushi bowed himself to Joab and ran.
And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, But whatever happens, please let me also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why will you run, my son, since you have no news ready?
But whatever the case, he said, Let me run. So he said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain, and outran Cushi.
Now David was sitting between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate, to the wall, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was running alone.
And the watchman cried out and reported to the king. And the king said, If he is alone, there is news in his mouth. And he proceeded to come and drew near.
Then the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, There is another man running alone! And the king said, He also brings news.
And the watchman said, It looks like the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and comes with good news.
And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, Peace! And he bowed down with his face to the earth to the king, and said, Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delivered up the men who had lifted up their hand against my lord the king!
And king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant and me your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was about.
And the king said, Turn aside and stand here. So he turned aside and remained standing.
And then Cushi came, and Cushi said, Good news, my lord the king! For Jehovah has avenged you this day of all those who were rising up against you.
And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who have risen up against you to do harm, be like that young man!
And the king was disquieted, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he said thus: O my son Absalom; my son, my son Absalom; O that I had died in your place! O Absalom my son, my son!
And it was reported to Joab, Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.
So the deliverance that day was turned into mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, The king is grieved for his son.
And the people stole back into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
And the king had covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!
And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Today you have shamed the faces of all your servants who today have delivered your soul, the souls of your sons and daughters, the souls of your wives and the souls of your concubines,
to love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, that it would have pleased you well.
Now therefore, arise, go out and speak to the heart of your servants. For I swear by Jehovah, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.
And the king arose and sat in the gate. And they announced to all the people, saying, Behold, the king is sitting in the gate. So all the people came before the king. For everyone of Israel had fled to his tent.
Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king has rescued us out of the hand of our enemies, he has delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled from the land because of Absalom.
But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why are you being silent to bring back the king?
So King David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his house?
You are my brethren, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?
And say to Amasa, Are you not my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of the army before me all the days, in place of Joab.
And he inclined the hearts of all the men of Judah, as one man, so that they sent this word to the king: Return, you and all your servants!
And the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah had come to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king across the Jordan.
And Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was from Bahurim, hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they had rushed over the Jordan before the king.
And a ferryboat went across to carry over the king’s household, and to do good in his eyes. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan.
And he said to the king, Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember how your servant acted perversely on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem, that the king should take it to heart.
For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I am the first to come today of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the anointed of Jehovah?
And David said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?
Therefore the king said to Shimei, You shall not die. And the king swore to him.
And Mephibosheth the son of Saul had come down to meet the king. And he had not attended to his feet, nor done his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace.
And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?
And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king, because your servant is lame.
And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king, but my lord the king is like the angel of God. Therefore do what is good in your eyes.
For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king. Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out anymore to the king?
And the king said to him, Why do you speak anymore of your matters? I have said, You and Ziba divide the land.
And Mephibosheth said to the king, Even let him take it all, inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house.
And Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim and went across the Jordan with the king, to send him across the Jordan.
Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years old. And he had sustained the king while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.
And the king said to Barzillai, Come across with me, and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem.
But Barzillai said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
I am today eighty years old. Can I discern between the good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king?
Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me with such a reward?
Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what is good in your eyes.
And the king answered, Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what is good in your eyes. And whatever you choose of me, I will do for you.
And all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.
And the king passed on over to Gilgal, and Chimham passed along with him. And all the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.
And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king, his household, and all David’s men with him across the Jordan?
So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is next of kin to us. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense? Or has he given us any gift?
And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king; therefore we also have more in David than you. Why then have you despised us; were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king? Yet the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
And there met them there a man of worthlessness, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a shofar, and said: We have no part in David, nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel!
So every man of Israel withdrew from David, and followed after Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, stayed close to their king.
And David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in confinement and sustained them, but did not go in to them. Thus they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
And the king said to Amasa, Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and present yourself.
So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah. But he delayed beyond the appointed time which David had designated.
And David said to Abishai, Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and be snatched away before our eyes.
So Joab’s men, with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, went out after him. And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt with a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he went forth, it fell out.
Then Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
But Amasa was not aware of the sword that was in Joab’s hand. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and his entrails poured out on the ground; and he did not strike him again. Thus he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
And one of Joab’s men stood near Amasa, and said, Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David; follow after Joab!
But Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came upon him stopped.
When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after him.
And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who were with Joab were destroying the wall to throw it down.
Then a wise woman cried out from the city, Hear, Hear! Please say to Joab, Come nearby, that I may speak with you.
When he had come near to her, the woman said, Are you Joab? He answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. And he answered, I am listening.
So she spoke, saying, They used to talk in former times, saying, They shall inquire to ask at Abel, and thus they would end the matter.
I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?
And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy!
That is not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. So the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
And the woman in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. Then he blew a shofar, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.
And Joab was over all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
Adoram was over the tribute; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
Sheva was scribe; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
and Ira the Jairite was a chief minister to David.
Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David besought the face of Jehovah. And Jehovah answered, It is because of Saul and his bloody house, because he had killed the Gibeonites.
So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites. The children of Israel had sworn peace to them, but Saul had sought to kill them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.)
Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless the inheritance of Jehovah?
And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us. So he said, Whatever you say, I will do for you.
And they answered the king, As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us, that we should be annihilated from remaining in any of the territories of Israel,
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them before Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul, whom Jehovah chose. And the king said, I will deliver them.
But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she had borne to Saul; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite;
and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before Jehovah. So they fell, all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
Now Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until the waters poured on them from the heavens. And she did not allow the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.
And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the town square of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa.
And he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who were hanged.
And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin in Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. Thus they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
And the Philistines were at war again with Israel. And David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint.
And Ishbi-Benob, who was of the sons of the giants, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of bronze, who was bearing a new sword, intended to kill David.
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, You shall go out no more with us to battle, that you not quench the lamp of Israel.
And it happened after this that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was of the sons of the giants.
Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed one from Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giants.
And when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
These four were born to the giants in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song, on the day when Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.
And he said: Jehovah is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer;
the God of my rock, in whom I will trust; my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; my Savior, You save me from violence.
I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised; thus shall I be saved from my enemies.
When the waves of death surrounded me, the floods of ungodliness terrified me;
the sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me;
in my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; and He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry entered His ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the heavens quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.
Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth; coals were kindled by it.
He bowed the heavens also, and came down with darkness under His feet.
He rode upon a cherub, and flew; and He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness booths around Him, dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
From the brightness before Him coals of fire were kindled.
Jehovah thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice.
He sent out arrows and scattered them; lightning bolts, and He discomfited them.
And the channels of the sea were seen, the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuke of Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.
He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.
They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but Jehovah was my support.
He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.
Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.
For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not acted wickedly against my God.
For all His judgments were before me; and as for His statutes, I did not turn aside from them.
I was also whole before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore Jehovah has recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness before His eyes.
With the faithful You show Yourself kind; with a mighty man of integrity You show Yourself upright;
with the pure You show Yourself pure; and with the perverse You show Yourself twisted.
You save the lowly people; but Your eyes are upon the haughty, whom You bring down.
For You are my lamp, O Jehovah; Jehovah causes my darkness to shine.
For by You I run against a troop; by my God I leap over a wall.
As for the Mighty God, His way is perfect; the Word of Jehovah is proven; He is a shield to all who seek refuge in Him.
For who is the Mighty God, except Jehovah? And who is a rock, except our God?
The Mighty God is my refuge and strength, and He makes my way whole.
He makes my feet like the deer, and sets me on my high places.
He teaches my hands to do battle, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your affliction has made me great.
You enlarged my steps under me, so my feet have not slipped.
I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them; and did not turn back until they were destroyed.
And I destroyed and shattered them, so that they could not rise; they fell under my feet.
For You girded me with strength for battle; those rising against me You caused to bow under me.
You have also given me the necks of my enemies, so that I annihilated those who hated me.
They looked, but there was no one to save; even to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.
And I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pulverized them like the mire of the streets, and I stamped them out.
You also delivered me from the strivings of my people. You kept me as the head of the nations; a people I have not known serve me.
Sons of foreigners cower before me; when they hear with the ear, they obey me.
Sons of foreigners fade away, and are afraid in their holes.
Jehovah lives! Blessed is my Rock! Exalted is God, the Rock of my salvation!
It is the Mighty God who avenges me, and brings down the peoples under me;
He delivers me from my enemies. You also lift me up above those rising against me; You deliver me from the violent man.
Therefore I give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, among the nations, and sing unto Your name.
He is the tower of salvation to His king, and shows mercy to His anointed, unto David and his seed forevermore.
Now these are the last words of David. Thus says David the son of Jesse; thus says the man raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel:
The Spirit of Jehovah has spoken by me, and His Word was on my tongue.
The God of Israel has said, the Rock of Israel has spoken to me: He who rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
And he shall be like the light of the morning when the sun rises, a morning without clouds, like the tender grass springing out of the earth, by clear shining after rain.
Although my house is not so with the Mighty God, yet He has made with me a perpetual covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For all my salvation and all my desire, will He not make it grow?
But the sons of worthlessness shall all be as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with the hand.
But the man who touches them must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they shall be burned with fire to be burned in their place.
These are the names of David’s mighty men: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the commanders. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he killed eight hundred men at one time.
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel retreated.
He rose up and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. Jehovah brought about a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.
And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines.
But he took his stand in the middle of the plot, delivered it, and struck the Philistines. And Jehovah brought about a great deliverance.
And three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam. And the company of the Philistines encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
And David longed and said, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of the water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah.
And he said, Far be it from me, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their souls? Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.
And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of another three. He lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name among these three.
Was he not the most honored of three? Therefore he became their commander. However, he did not attain to the first three.
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two from Moab that were like lions. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
And he killed an Egyptian, a spectacular man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; so he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty ones.
He was more honored than the thirty, but he had not attained to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
Abiezer the Anathothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
Heleb the son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,
Benaiah a Pirathonite, Hiddai from the brooks of Gaash,
Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
Eliahba the Shaalbonite (of the sons of Jashen), Jonathan,
Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite (armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
and Uriah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
Again the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.
So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people.
And Joab said to the king, Now may Jehovah your God add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king desire this thing?
Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. Therefore Joab and the commanders of the army went out from before the king to number the people of Israel.
And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the right side of the town which is in the midst of the valley of Gad, and toward Jazer.
Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon;
and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to the south of Judah as far as Beer-sheba.
So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
And David’s heart was smitten after he had numbered the people. So David said to Jehovah, I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O Jehovah, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.
And when David arose in the morning, the Word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,
Go and say to David, Thus says Jehovah: I am setting before you three things; choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.
So Gad came to David and reported to him; and he said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of plague in your land? Now consider and see what word I shall take back to Him who sent me.
And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Let us fall now into the hand of Jehovah, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.
So Jehovah sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men of the people died.
And when the Angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, Jehovah was moved to compassion regarding the evil, and said to the Angel who was destroying the people, Enough! Now restrain your hand. And the Angel of Jehovah was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
Then David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the Angel who was striking the people, and said, Surely I have sinned, and I have committed iniquity; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father’s house.
And Gad came that day to David and said to him, Go up, build an altar unto Jehovah on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
And David, according to the word of Gad, went up as Jehovah commanded.
And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar unto Jehovah, that the plague may be restrained from the people.
And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever is good in his eyes. Behold, the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood.
All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king. And Araunah said to the king, May Jehovah your God accept you.
And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will buy to acquire it from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings unto Jehovah my God for free. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was restrained from Israel.
Now King David was old, advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, for he could not get warm.
Therefore his servants said to him, Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and serve him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.
So they sought for a beautiful girl throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
The girl was very beautiful; and she served the king, and ministered to him; but the king did not know her.
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
(Now his father had not hurt him at any time by saying, Why have you done so? He was also very good in appearance. And his mother had borne him after Absalom.)
And he spoke with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they went after Adonijah and helped him.
But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David were not with Adonijah.
And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants.
But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or Solomon his brother.
So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it?
Come now, please let me counsel you with advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
Depart and go to King David and say to him, Have you not sworn to your maidservant, my lord, O king, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?
Then, while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.
So Bathsheba came into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.)
And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. And the king said, What can I do for you?
And she said to him, My lord, you have sworn by Jehovah your God to your maidservant, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.
So now, behold, Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you have not known about it.
He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.
And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king lies down with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.
And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
And they reported to the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed down to the king with his face to the ground.
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?
For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they said, Long live King Adonijah!
But he has not invited me; me your servant, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.
Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king, and you have not declared to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
Then King David answered and said, Summon Bathsheba to me. So she came before the king and stood before the king.
And the king swore and said, As Jehovah lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress,
just as I have sworn to you by Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place, thus I shall do this day.
And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did homage to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever!
And King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came in before the king.
And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel; and blow the shofar, and say, Long live King Solomon!
And when you have come up after him, he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen! Thus says Jehovah the God of my lord the king.
As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so shall He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.
So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.
And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon!
And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent with their sound.
And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why is the city in such a commotion?
And while he was still speaking, behold Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest came in. And Adonijah said to him, Come in, for you are a mighty man, and bring good news.
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, No rather, our lord King David has made Solomon king.
The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule.
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is all stirred up. This is the sound that you have heard.
Also Solomon has sat down on the throne of the kingdom.
And moreover the king’s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed.
Also the king has said, Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, with my eyes seeing it!
So all the guests who were with Adonijah trembled, and rose up, and each one went his way.
And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.
And Solomon said, If he is a son of worth, not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if evil is found in him, he shall die.
So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.
And the days drew near for David to die, and he charged Solomon his son, saying:
I am going the way of all the earth; be strong, therefore, and be a man.
And keep the charge of Jehovah your God: to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;
that Jehovah may establish His word which He has spoken concerning me, saying, If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, He said, there shall not fail to be a man on the throne of Israel.
Moreover you know also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed. And he shed the blood of war in peacetime, and put the blood of war on the belt around his waist, and on the sandals on his feet.
Therefore do according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace.
But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those eating at your table, for they came to me when I fled before Absalom your brother.
And behold, with you is Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who cursed me with grievous cursing in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by Jehovah, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.
Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man and know what you ought to do to him; but bring his gray hair down to the grave with blood.
So David rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David.
The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years.
And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David; and his kingdom was firmly established.
And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come in peace? And he said, In peace.
Moreover he said, I have something to say to you. And she said, Speak.
And he said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces toward me, to reign. However, the kingdom has been turned around, and has become my brother’s; for it was his from Jehovah.
Now I ask one petition of you; do not turn away my face. And she said to him, Speak.
And he said, Please speak to King Solomon, for he will not turn away your face; that he would give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.
And Bathsheba said, Very well, I will speak for you unto the king.
Bathsheba therefore came to King Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed down to her, and sat down on his throne and had a throne set for the king’s mother; and she sat at his right hand.
And she said, I am asking one small petition of you; do not turn away my face. And the king said to her, Ask it, my mother, for I will not turn away your face.
So she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.
And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, Now why are you asking for Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother; for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
And King Solomon swore by Jehovah, saying, May God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own soul!
Now therefore, as Jehovah lives, who has confirmed me and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has established a house for me, as He has promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day!
So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him and he died.
And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are a man deserving of death; but I will not put you to death this day, because you have carried the ark of the Lord Jehovah before my father David, and because you were afflicted in every thing in which my father was afflicted.
Thus Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest unto Jehovah, to fulfill the word of Jehovah which He had spoken concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.
And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned aside after Adonijah, though he had not turned aside after Absalom. So Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and took hold of the horns of the altar.
And it was reported to King Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and behold, he is by the altar. So Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
So Benaiah went to the tent of Jehovah, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come out! And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought back word to the king, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him and bury him, that you may turn aside from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood which Joab has shed.
Thus Jehovah shall return his blood upon his own head, who has fallen upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, without the knowledge of my father David: Abner the son of Ner, the commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, the commander of the army of Judah.
Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed forever. But upon David and his seed, upon his house and his throne, there shall be peace forever from Jehovah.
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
And the king appointed Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army, and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.
And the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there anywhere.
For it shall be, on the day that you go out and have crossed over the Brook Kidron, consider to understand that you shall be executed to death; your blood shall be on your own head.
And Shimei said to the king, The word is good. As my lord the king has spoken, thus your servant will do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two slaves of Shimei fled to Achish the son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they reported to Shimei, saying, Behold, your slaves are at Gath!
So Shimei rose up, saddled his donkey, and went to Achish at Gath to seek his slaves. And Shimei went and brought his slaves from Gath.
And it was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
So the king sent and summoned Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make you swear by Jehovah, and warn you, saying, Consider to understand that on the day you go out and have gone anywhere, you shall be executed to death? And you said to me, The word I have heard is good.
Why then have you not kept the oath of Jehovah and the commandment that I have charged you with?
The king said moreover to Shimei, You know, as your heart acknowledges, all the evil that you did to my father David; therefore Jehovah shall return your evil upon your own head.
But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah forever.
So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went out and fell upon him, and he died. Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
And Solomon made himself son-in-law to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter; and he brought her into the City of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of Jehovah, and the wall all around Jerusalem.
The people were sacrificing at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of Jehovah until those days.
And Solomon loved Jehovah, walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he was sacrificing and burning incense at the high places.
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
At Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, Ask; what shall I give you?
And Solomon said: You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You have given him a son sitting on his throne, as it is this day.
Now, O Jehovah my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I am a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.
And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen, a people too numerous to be numbered or counted for multitude.
Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?
And the word was good in the eyes of Jehovah, that Solomon had asked this thing.
And God said to him: Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice,
behold, I have done according to your words; behold, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you.
And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days.
So if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as your father David has walked, then I will prolong your days.
And Solomon awoke; and behold it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants.
Now two women who were harlots came to the king, and stood before him.
And one woman said, O my lord, this woman and I are dwelling in the same house; and I gave birth while she was in the house.
Then it happened on the third day after I gave birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we were together; no one was with us in the house, except the two of us in the house.
And this woman’s son died in the night, because she had lain on him.
So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
And when I arose in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, behold, he was not my son whom I had borne.
And the other woman said, No! But the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son. And the first woman said, No! But the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
And the king said, The one says, This is my son, who lives, and your son is the dead one; and the other says, No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.
And the king said, Bring me a sword. So they brought a sword before the king.
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.
Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for her womb yearned for her son; and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and do not put him to death! But the other said, Let him be neither mine nor yours, but divide him.
So the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and do not put him to death; she is his mother.
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered, and they feared his presence; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to execute justice.
Thus King Solomon was king over all Israel.
And these were his officials: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;
Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, over the army; Zadok and Abiathar, the priests;
Azariah the son of Nathan, over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest and the king’s friend;
Ahishar, over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda, over the labor force.
And Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month of the year.
These are their names: Ben-Hur, in the mountains of Ephraim;
Ben-Deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan;
Ben-Hesed, in Arubboth; to him belonged Sochoh and all the land of Hepher;
Ben-Abinadab, in all the regions of Dor; he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as wife;
Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth Shean, which is beside Zaretan below Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as the other side of Jokneam;
Ben-Geber, in Ramoth Gilead; to him belonged the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, in Gilead; to him also belonged the region of Argob in Bashan; sixty large cities with walls and bronze gate-bars;
Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
Ahimaaz, in Naphtali; he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife;
Baanah the son of Hushai, in Asher and Aloth;
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin;
Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan. He was the only deputy who was in the land.
Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.
And Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour, sixty kors of meal,
ten fatted oxen, twenty oxen from the pastures, and one hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fatted fowl.
For he was ruling over all the region on this side of the River from Tiphsah even to Gaza, namely over all the kings on this side of the River; and he had peace on every side all around him.
And Judah and Israel dwelt securely, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan as far as Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
And these deputies, each man in his month, provided food for King Solomon and for all who came to King Solomon’s table. They left nothing lacking.
They also brought barley and straw to the assigned places, for the horses and steeds, each man according to his charge.
And God gave Solomon wisdom and exceedingly great understanding, and breadth of heart like the sand on the seashore.
Thus Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt.
For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.
He spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were one thousand and five.
He also spoke of trees, from the cedar tree of Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish.
And men of all nations, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram had loved David all his days.
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:
You know how my father David could not build a house unto the name of Jehovah his God because of the wars that were around him on every side, until Jehovah had put them under the soles of his feet.
But now Jehovah my God has given me rest all around; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.
And behold, I am intending to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God, as Jehovah has spoken to my father David, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house unto My name.
Now therefore, command that they cut down cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.
And so it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed is Jehovah this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people!
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: I have agreed to the things which you have sent me, and I will do all your desire concerning the cedar and cypress timber.
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you direct me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by giving food for my household.
And Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress timber according to all his desire.
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty kors of beaten oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.
Thus Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom, as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made an alliance together.
And King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men.
And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the labor force.
And Solomon had seventy thousand carrying burdens, and eighty thousand hewing stone in the mountains,
besides three thousand three hundred from the chiefs of Solomon’s deputies, who ruled the people who did the work.
And the king commanded, and they quarried large stones, costly stones, and hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
Thus Solomon’s builders, Hiram’s builders, and the Giblites cut and prepared timber and stones to build the house.
And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of Jehovah.
Now the house which King Solomon built for Jehovah, its length was sixty cubits, its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits.
The porch in front of the sanctuary of the house was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the width of the porch extended ten cubits from the front of the house.
And for the house he made window frames with shutters.
Against the wall of the house he built chambers all around, against the walls of the house, all around the temple and the inner sanctuary. Thus he made chambers all around.
The lowest chamber was five cubits wide, the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the house, so that the support beams would not be fastened into the walls of the house.
And the house, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or ax or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.
The doorway for the middle level was on the right side of the house. They went up by a winding staircase to the middle level, and from the middle to the third.
Thus he built the house and finished it, and he paneled the house with beams and planks of cedar.
And he built chambers against the entire house, each five cubits high; they were attached to the house with cedar beams.
And the Word of Jehovah came to Solomon, saying:
Concerning this house which you are building, if you walk in My statutes, execute My judgments, keep all My commandments to walk in them, then I will establish My word with you, which I have spoken unto your father David.
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake My people Israel.
Thus Solomon built the house and finished it.
And he built the walls of the house on the inside with cedar boards; from the walls of the house to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with planks of cypress.
And he built twenty-cubits at the rear of the house, from floor to the walls, with cedar boards; he built it inside for the inner sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.
And in front of the inner house the rest of the temple was forty cubits long.
And on the cedar inside the house were carvings of gourds and open flowers. All was of cedar; no stone was seen.
And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the house, to set the ark of the covenant of Jehovah there.
The faces of the inner sanctuary were twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. And he overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the altar with cedar.
And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.
The whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house; also he overlaid with gold the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary.
Inside the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits: ten cubits from the end of one wing to the end of the other.
And the other cherub was ten cubits; both cherubim were of the same size and the same shape.
The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.
And he set the cherubim inside the inner house; and they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the house.
He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
And he carved all the walls of the house all around, inside and out, with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, both inside and out.
For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and doorposts were one-fifth.
The two doors were of olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold; and he beat out the gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
And for the door of the temple he also made doorposts of olive wood; one-fourth.
And the two doors were of cypress wood; two panels comprised one folding door, and two panels comprised the other folding door.
And he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them, and overlaid them with gold smoothly fitted to the carved work.
And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.
In the fourth year the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid, in the month of Ziv.
And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. Thus he was seven years in building it.
And Solomon took thirteen years to build his own house; and he finished all his house.
He also built the house of the Forest of Lebanon; its length was one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, with four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars.
And it was paneled with cedar above the beams that were on forty-five pillars, fifteen to a row.
There were windows with beveled frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three tiers.
And all the doorways and doorposts were squared; and window was opposite window in three tiers.
He also made the porch of pillars: its length was fifty cubits, and its width thirty cubits; and in front of them was a porch with pillars, and a threshold in front of them.
- - -
And the house where he dwelt had another court inside the porch, of similar workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this porch for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken as wife.
All these were of costly stones cut to size, sawn with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the coping, and also on the outside to the great court.
The foundation was of costly stones, large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
And above were costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar.
The great court was of three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the inner court of the house of Jehovah and the porch of the house.
Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre.
He was the son of a widow woman from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, engraving in bronze; he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill to work in all workmanship in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.
And he cast two pillars of bronze, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits circled all the way around.
And he made two capitals of cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.
He made a lattice network, with braids of chainwork, for the capitals on top of the pillars: seven for one capital and seven for the other capital.
And he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals on top; and thus he did for the other capital.
The capitals which were on top of the pillars in the hall were made like lilies, four cubits.
The capitals on the two pillars also had pomegranates above, by the belly which was next to the network; and there were two hundred such pomegranates in rows on the other capital all around.
And he set up the pillars by the porch of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz.
The tops of the pillars were made like lilies. Thus the work of the pillars was finished.
And he made the cast sea of ten cubits from brim to brim; it was round all around. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits made a circuit all the way around.
Below its brim round about were gourds all around, ten to a cubit, all the way around the sea. The gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.
It stood on twelve oxen: three turned toward the north, three turned toward the west, three turned toward the south, and three turned toward the east; the sea was set on top of them, and all their back parts were inward.
Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom; and it could hold two thousand baths.
And he made ten carts of bronze; four cubits the length of the one cart, and four cubits the breadth, and three cubits the height.
And this was the work of the cart: they had borders, and there were borders between the stays.
And on the borders that were between the stays were lions, oxen, and cherubim. And a pedestal was on the stays above. And below the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.
And each cart had four wheels of bronze, and axles of bronze. And its four feet were supports to them; under the basin were cast supports with wreaths at each side.
And its opening within and above the capital was a cubit; and its opening was round like the work of a pedestal, a cubit and a half. And also on its opening were carvings; and their borders were square, not round.
And the four wheels were under the borders. And the axles of the wheels were attached to the cart; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.
The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.
And there were four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports were part of the cart itself.
On the top of the cart was a round compass a half cubit in height. And on the top of the cart, its stays and its supports were of the same casting.
On the plates of its stays and on its borders he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around.
Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same cast, one measure, and one shape.
And he made ten basins of bronze; each basin could hold forty baths, and each basin was four cubits. On each of the ten carts was a basin.
And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.
Hiram made the basins, the shovels and the bowls. Thus Hiram finished doing all the work that he did for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah:
the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on top of the pillars;
four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars);
the ten carts, and ten basins on the carts;
the one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
the pots, the shovels, and the bowls. All these articles which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah were of burnished bronze.
In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in the clay ground between Succoth and Zaretan.
And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because there were so very many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
Thus Solomon had all the articles made for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which was the Bread of the Presence;
the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold;
the basins, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house (the Holy of Holies) and for the doors of the house of the temple.
Thus all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and the articles, and He put them in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.
Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, unto King Solomon at Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the City of David, which is Zion.
Therefore all the men of Israel assembled unto King Solomon at the feast in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
So all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
And they brought up the ark of Jehovah, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up.
And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.
For the cherubim spread their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles.
The poles extended so that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place, in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.
Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah,
such that the priests were not able to stand to minister before the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.
Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said that He would dwell in the thick darkness.
I have built to establish for You an exalted house, a fixed place for You to abide continually.
And the king turned his face around and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.
And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has spoke with His mouth to my father David, and with His hand has fulfilled it, saying,
Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, for My name to be there; but I chose David to be over My people Israel.
Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well that it was in your heart.
Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall come from your body, he shall build the house for My name.
Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken; and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has promised; and I have built a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
And there I have fixed a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He had made with our fathers, when He brought them out from the land of Egypt.
Then Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in front of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward the heavens;
and he said: Jehovah the God of Israel, there is no god in the heavens above or on the earth below like You, who keeps Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.
You have kept what You have promised Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.
Therefore, Jehovah the God of Israel, now keep what You have promised Your servant David my father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man sitting before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, to walk before Me as you have walked before Me.
And now I pray, O God of Israel, let Your word be confirmed, which You have spoken to Your servant David my father.
But will God truly dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built!
Yet regard the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You today:
that Your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, toward the place of which You have said, My name shall be there, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.
And may You hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear in Heaven Your dwelling place; and when You hear, forgive.
When anyone sins against his neighbor, and is required to take an oath, and has come to swear an oath before Your altar in this house,
then hear in Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to condemn the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and to justify the righteous, giving him according to his righteousness.
When Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and when they turn back to You and confess Your name, and pray and make supplication to You in this house,
then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to their fathers.
When the heavens are restrained and there is no rain because they have sinned against You; when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,
then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemy besieges them in the land in their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;
whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows the plague of his own heart, and spreads out his hands toward this house:
then hear in Heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and act, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone have known the hearts of all the sons of men),
that they may fear You all the days that they are alive on the face of the land which You have given to our fathers.
Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but has come from a distant land on account of Your name
(for they will hear of Your great name and Your strong hand and Your outstretched arm), when he has come and prayed toward this house,
hear in Heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls upon You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name to fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.
When Your people go out to battle against their enemy, wherever You send them, and when they pray to Jehovah toward the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,
then hear in Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and attend to their cause.
When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You have become angry with them and delivered them to the enemy, and they have taken them captive to the land of the enemy, far or near;
yet when they have returned in their minds in the land where they have been carried captive, and have repented in their hearts, and made supplication to You in the land of those holding them captive, saying, We have sinned and done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
and when they return to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, and have prayed to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name:
then hear in Heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplication, and attend to their cause,
and forgive Your people who have sinned against You, and all their transgressions which they have transgressed against You; and grant them compassion before those who took them captive, that they may have compassion on them
(for they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out of Egypt, out of the midst of the iron furnace),
that Your eyes may be open to the supplication of Your servant and the supplication of Your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they call unto You.
For as You have spoken by the hand of Your servant Moses, You have separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be Your inheritance, when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.
And so it was, when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication unto Jehovah, that he arose before the altar of Jehovah, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to the heavens.
And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:
Blessed is Jehovah, who has given rest to His people Israel, according to all that He has spoken. There has not failed one word of all His good word, which He has spoken by the hand of His servant Moses.
Jehovah our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He not leave us nor forsake us,
that He may incline our hearts unto Himself, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, which He has commanded our fathers.
And may these words of mine, with which I have made supplication before Jehovah, be near Jehovah our God day and night, that He may attend to the cause of His servant and the cause of His people Israel, each matter from day to day,
that all the peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is God; there is no other.
Let your heart therefore be perfect with Jehovah our God, to walk in His statutes and keep His commandments, as at this day.
And the king and all Israel with him were offering sacrifices before Jehovah.
And Solomon offered sacrifices of peace offerings, which he offered unto Jehovah, twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah.
And for that day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before Jehovah our God, seven days and seven more days; fourteen days.
On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the good that Jehovah had done for His servant David, and for Israel His people.
And it came to pass, when Solomon was finished building the house of Jehovah and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he had taken delight to do,
that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
And Jehovah said to him: I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built to put My name there always; and My eyes and My heart will be there all the days.
Now if you walk before Me as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and My judgments,
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I have spoken to David your father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
But if you or your sons go back to turn away from after Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and bow down to them,
then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will send away from before My face; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
And as for this house, which is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and shall hiss, and say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house?
Then they will answer, Because they have forsaken Jehovah their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken up with other gods, and bowed down to them and served them; therefore Jehovah has brought all this evil upon them.
And it happened at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Jehovah and the king’s house
(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), that King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
And Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they were not pleasing to his eyes.
So he said, What kind of cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul, to this day.
And Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
And this is the reason for the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of Jehovah, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.)
And Solomon built Gezer, lower Beth Horon,
Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,
all the storage cities that Solomon had, cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
All the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel;
that is, their sons who were left in the land after them, whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely; from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.
But of the children of Israel Solomon made no slaves, because they were men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
Others were chiefs of the officers who were over Solomon’s work: five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.
When Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her, then he built the Millo.
Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he had built unto Jehovah, and he burned incense on the altar that was before Jehovah. Thus he finished the house.
King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, along with the servants of Solomon.
And they came to Ophir, and carried away four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of Jehovah, she came to test him with hard questions.
She came to Jerusalem with a very great company, with camels bearing spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was on her heart.
And Solomon made known all her matters; there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain it to her.
And when the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, it took her breath away.
Then she said to the king: It was a true word which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom.
However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I have heard.
Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because of Jehovah’s eternal love for Israel, therefore He made you king, to execute justice and righteousness.
And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
And the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, also brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir.
And the king made pillars of the almug wood for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house, and harps and lutes for the singers. There never again came such almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day.
And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given to her according to the hand of the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.
The weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
besides that from the traveling merchants, from the income of traders, from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the land.
And King Solomon made two hundred shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the house of the Forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round at the back; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests.
Twelve lions were standing there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.
All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
For the king had a fleet of ships at sea from Tarshish along with the fleet of Hiram; and once every three years the ships from Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his heart.
Each man was bringing his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.
Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Mikveh; the king’s merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.
Now a chariot that came up out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
But King Solomon loved many foreign women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh: Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
from the nations of whom Jehovah had said to the children of Israel, You shall not go in to them, nor they to you. Truly they will thrust aside your hearts after their gods. These, Solomon clung to in love.
And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives thrust away his heart.
For so it was, when Solomon was old, that his wives thrust his heart aside after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.
For Solomon departed after Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
Solomon did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did not fully follow after Jehovah, like his father David.
And Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, on the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
And he did likewise for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
And Jehovah was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned aside from Jehovah the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
and had charged him concerning this thing, that he should not depart after other gods; but he had not kept what Jehovah had charged.
Therefore Jehovah said to Solomon, Because you have done this, and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have charged you, I will rend to tear the kingdom away from you, and have given it to your servant.
Nevertheless I will not do it in your days, for the sake of your father David; I shall tear it out of the hand of your son.
However I will not tear away the whole kingdom; I shall give one tribe to your son for the sake of my servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem which I have chosen.
And Jehovah raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the seed of the king in Edom.
For it happened, when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had killed every male in Edom
(because for six months Joab remained there with all Israel, until he had cut down every male in Edom),
that Hadad fled to go to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him. Hadad was still a little child.
And they rose up out of Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, apportioned food for him, and gave him land.
And Hadad found great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, that is, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.
And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.
So when Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army had died, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own land.
And Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that behold you are seeking to go to your own land? And he answered, Nothing, however send me away to let me go.
And God raised up another adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of Zobah.
So he gathered men to him and became leader over a band of raiders, when David killed those of Zobah. And they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.
He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon (besides the evil that Hadad did); and he loathed Israel, and reigned over Syria.
And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Solomon’s servant, an Ephrathite from Zereda, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, also lifted up his hand against the king.
And this was the matter for which he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon had built the Millo and repaired the breaches to the City of David his father.
And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw that the young man was industrious, and made him overseer over the burden bearers of the house of Joseph.
And it happened at that time, when Jeroboam had gone out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the way; and he was clothed with a new garment, and the two were alone in the field.
And Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.
And he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I am tearing the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and have given ten tribes to you
(but he shall have one tribe for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel),
because they have forsaken Me, and bowed down to Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways to do what is right in My eyes and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as did his father David.
However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of My servant David, whom I have chosen because he has kept My commandments and My statutes.
But I have taken the kingdom out of his son’s hand and given it to you; ten tribes.
And to his son I will give one tribe, that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Myself, to put My name there.
And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all your soul’s desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
And it shall be, if you heed all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My eyes, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David has done, then I will be with you and build for you an enduring house, as I have built for David, and will give Israel to you.
And I will afflict the seed of David because of this, but not for all time.
Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the Acts of Solomon.
And the days that Solomon had reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
And Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
So it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it (he was still in Egypt, for he had fled from before King Solomon and had been dwelling in Egypt),
that they sent and called for him. Then Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
Your father had made our yoke severe; now therefore, lighten the hard service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he had put on us, and we will serve you.
So he said to them, Go away for three days, then come back to me. And the people departed.
And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, and he said, How do you counsel me to answer these people?
And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to these people today, and serve them, and answer them, and speak agreeable words to them, then they will be your servants all your days.
But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who were standing before him.
And he said to them, What counsel do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father has put on us?
And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you shall speak to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger has become fatter than my father’s loins!
And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.
And the king answered the people harshly, and rejected the counsel which the elders had given him;
and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!
Thus the king did not give heed to the people; for the turn of events was from Jehovah, to establish His word, which Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
And when all Israel saw that the king had not heeded them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now, see to your own house, O David! And Israel departed to their tents.
Thus Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
And King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute, but all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.
Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back, that they sent for him and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand choice men who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
But the Word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,
Thus says Jehovah: You shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel. Let every man return to his house, for this thing has come about from Me. Therefore they obeyed the Word of Jehovah, and returned to go back, according to the Word of Jehovah.
And Jeroboam built Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and dwelt there. Also he went out from there and built Penuel.
And Jeroboam thought in his heart, Now the kingdom may return to the house of David:
If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn back to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and go back to Rehoboam king of Judah.
Therefore the king took counsel, made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!
And he set up one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan.
Now this thing became a sin, for the people went before the one, even as far as Dan.
He made houses on the high places, and made priests from among all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
And Jeroboam instituted a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. Thus he did at Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made. And at Bethel he installed the priests of the high places which he had made.
Thus he offered up on the altar which he had made at Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had contrived in his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and offered sacrifices on the altar and burned incense.
And behold, a man of God went from Judah to Bethel by the Word of Jehovah, and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
And he cried out against the altar by the Word of Jehovah, and said, O altar, altar! Thus says Jehovah: Behold, a son, Josiah by name, shall be born to the house of David; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men’s bones shall be burned on you.
And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign that Jehovah has spoken this: Behold, the altar shall split apart, and the ashes on it shall be poured out.
So it came to pass when King Jeroboam heard the utterance of the man of God, who cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Arrest him! And his hand, which he had stretched forth toward him, withered, so that he could not pull it back to himself.
The altar also was split apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the Word of Jehovah.
And the king answered and said to the man of God, Please entreat the face of Jehovah your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. So the man of God entreated Jehovah, and the king’s hand was restored to him, and became as before.
And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.
But the man of God said to the king, If you were to give me half your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place.
For so it was commanded me by the Word of Jehovah, saying, You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you have come.
So he went another way and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
Now an old prophet dwelt in Bethel, and his sons came and recounted to him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.
And their father said to them, Which way did he go? For his sons had seen which way the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.
And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey for him; and he rode on it,
and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am.
And he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread.
And he said, I cannot return with you nor go in with you; neither can I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place.
For I have been told by the Word of Jehovah, You shall not eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by going the way you came.
And he said to him, I too am a prophet as you are, and an angel has spoken to me by the Word of Jehovah, saying, Bring him back with you to your house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.
So he turned back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
And it happened, as they sat at the table, that the Word of Jehovah came to the prophet who had brought him back;
and he cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Because you have disobeyed the Word of Jehovah, and have not kept the commandment with which Jehovah your God has charged you,
but you turned back, ate bread, and drank water in the place of which He said to you, Eat no bread and drink no water, your corpse shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.
So it was, after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk, that he saddled the donkey for him, the prophet whom he had brought back.
And when he left, a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his corpse was thrown on the road, and the donkey was standing by it. The lion also was standing by the corpse.
And behold, men were passing by and saw the corpse thrown on the road, and the lion standing by the corpse. And they came and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard it, he said, It is the man of God who had been rebellious against the mouth of Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to him.
And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled it.
And he went and found his corpse thrown on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse nor torn the donkey.
And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back. So the old prophet came to the city to mourn, and to bury him.
And he laid the corpse in his own tomb; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
So it was, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
For the word which he has cried out by the Word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
After these events Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but he went back to making priests from among all the people for the high places; whoever wished, he confirmed his hand, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
And this matter was the sin of the house of Jeroboam, so as to annihilate and destroy it from the face of the earth.
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam was sick.
And Jeroboam said to his wife, Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I would be king over this people.
Also take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what shall become of the child.
And Jeroboam’s wife did so; she arose and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes had become fixed by reason of his age.
And Jehovah had said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you something about her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.
And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in the door, that he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why do you pretend to be another person? For I am sent to you with a difficult message.
Go, say to Jeroboam, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Because I have exalted you from among the people, and appointed you ruler over My people Israel,
and tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and yet you have not been as My servant David, who kept My commandments and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do only what was right in My eyes;
but you have done more evil than all who were before you, for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me to anger, and have cast Me behind your back;
therefore behold, I am bringing calamity upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him who urinates against a wall, both bond and free in Israel; I will consume the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away the dung for burning until it is all gone.
The dogs shall eat whoever of Jeroboam dies in the city, and the birds of the heavens shall eat whoever dies in the field; for Jehovah has spoken!
Arise therefore, go to your own house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.
And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave; because out of the whole house of Jeroboam, only in him there is found something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel.
Moreover Jehovah shall raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day. What? Even straightaway!
For Jehovah shall strike Israel, as a reed flutters in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land which He has given to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their groves, provoking Jehovah to anger.
And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who has sinned and has made Israel sin.
And Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. And as she was entering the threshold of the house, the boy died.
And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
The days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years. And he rested with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.
And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
And Judah did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they sinned, more than all that their fathers had done.
For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.
And there were also male temple prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields which Solomon had made.
And King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the chief runners who guarded the door to the king’s house.
And whenever the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom.
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his place.
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.
And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; his heart was not perfect toward Jehovah his God, as was the heart of his father David.
Nevertheless for David’s sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him to establish Jerusalem;
because David had done what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and had not turned aside from anything that He had commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
And the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah. And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
And Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place.
In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah.
And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maachah the daughter of Abishalom.
Asa did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, as did his father David.
And he took away the male temple prostitutes from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
Also he removed Maachah his mother from being queen mother, because she had made a horrible thing in a grove. And Asa cut down her horrible thing and burned it by the Brook Kidron.
But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa’s heart was perfect toward Jehovah all his days.
He also brought into the house of Jehovah the things which his father had set apart, and the things which he himself had set apart: silver and gold and utensils.
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might let no one go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
Then Asa took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and the treasuries of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.
So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel. And he struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinnereth, with all the land of Naphtali.
Now it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in Tirzah.
Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; no one was exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah. But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.
Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam had become king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.
And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel was laying siege to Gibbethon.
Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
And it was so, when he became king, that he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger.
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned twenty-four years.
He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.
Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jehu the son of Hanani, against Baasha, saying:
Inasmuch as I raised you up out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and you have walked in the ways of Jeroboam, and have made My people Israel sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins,
behold, I will consume away after Baasha and after his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
The dogs shall eat whoever dies of Baasha in the city, and the birds of the heavens shall eat whoever dies in the fields.
Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son reigned in his place.
And also the Word of Jehovah came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he had done in the eyes of Jehovah to provoke Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he killed them.
In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, and reigned two years in Tirzah.
Now his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah.
And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.
And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, that he killed all the household of Baasha; he did not leave him one who urinates against a wall, neither of his kinsmen nor of his friends.
Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, according to the Word of Jehovah, which He had spoken against Baasha by the hand of Jehu the prophet,
for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
And the people who were encamped heard it said, Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king. So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
And Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.
And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city had been taken, that he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house down upon himself with fire, and died,
because of the sins which he had sinned in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah, in walking in the ways of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had done to make Israel sin.
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed after Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half after Omri.
But the people following after Omri prevailed over the people following after Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned.
In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, and reigned twelve years. Six years he reigned in Tirzah.
And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill.
And Omri did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and did worse than all who were before him;
for he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin, to provoke Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son reigned in his place.
In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, more than all who were before him.
And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal and bowed down to him.
And he set up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
And Ahab made a grove. Ahab did more to provoke Jehovah the God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.
In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation with Abiram his firstborn, and with his youngest son Segub he set up its gates, according to the Word of Jehovah, which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun.
And Elijah the Tishbite, of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As Jehovah the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except according to my word.
And the Word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
And it will be that you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.
So he went and did according to the Word of Jehovah, for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith, which is before the Jordan.
And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank from the brook.
And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
And the Word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to provide for you.
So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold the widow woman was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Please bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.
And she said, As Jehovah your God lives, I do not have a cake, only a handful of flour in a jar, and a little oil in a jug; and behold, I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
And Elijah said to her, Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son.
For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: The jar of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jug of oil become empty, until the day that Jehovah sends rain upon the face of the earth.
So she went and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate many days.
The jar of flour was not used up, nor did the jug of oil become empty, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of Elijah.
Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was very severe until there was no breath left in him.
So she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my iniquity to remembrance, and to kill my son?
And he said to her, Give me your son. So he took him out of her bosom and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
And he cried out unto Jehovah and said, O Jehovah my God, have You also brought tragedy upon the widow woman who is showing me hospitality, by killing her son?
And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out unto Jehovah and said, O Jehovah my God, I pray, let this child’s soul return into him.
And Jehovah heeded the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back into him, and he revived.
And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, See, your son lives!
Then the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that you are a man of God, and that the Word of Jehovah in your mouth is truth.
And it came to pass after many days that the Word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the face of the earth.
So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and the famine was severe in Samaria.
And Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (Now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly.
For so it was, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.)
And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to destroy any of the livestock.
So they divided the land between them, to pass through it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
And as Obadiah was on his way, behold Elijah met him; and he recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, Is that you, my lord Elijah?
And he answered him, It is I. Go, tell your master, Behold, Elijah is here.
And he said, How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?
As Jehovah your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, He is not here, he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they did not find you.
And now you are saying, Go, tell your master, Behold Elijah is here!
And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of Jehovah will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared Jehovah from my youth.
Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of Jehovah, how I hid one hundred men of the prophets of Jehovah, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
And now you say, Go, tell your master, Behold Elijah is here. He will kill me!
And Elijah said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and reported to him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
And it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Is that you, O troubler of Israel?
And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, in that you have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah and have gone after the Baals.
Now therefore, send and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the groves, who eat at Jezebel’s table.
So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel.
And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long will you be limping between two divided opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow after him. But the people answered him not a word.
Then Elijah said to the people, I alone am left a prophet of Jehovah; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.
Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it; and I will prepare the other bull, and lay it on the wood, but put no fire under it.
Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call upon the name of Jehovah; and the god who answers by fire, He is God. So all the people answered and said, The word is good.
And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first, for you are many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.
So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, O Baal, hear us! But there was no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.
And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.
So they cried aloud, and cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them.
And when midday was past, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.
Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. So all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of Jehovah that was broken down.
And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the Word of Jehovah had come, saying, Israel shall be your name.
And with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
And he put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and said, Fill four waterpots with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.
Then he said, Do it a second time, and they did it a second time; and he said, Do it a third time, and they did it a third time.
And the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.
And it came to pass, at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your Word.
Testify, O Jehovah, testify, that this people may know that You are Jehovah God, and that You have turned their hearts around back to You.
Then the fire of Jehovah fell and consumed the burnt offering, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that was in the trench.
And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces; and they said, Jehovah, He is God! Jehovah, He is God!
And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape! So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.
And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.
So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees,
and said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. So he went up and looked, and said, There is nothing. And seven times he said, Go back.
And it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea! So he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.
And it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel.
And the hand of Jehovah came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
And Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.
And when he saw that, he arose and ran for his life, and came to Beer-sheba of Judah, and left his servant there.
But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he requested for his soul that he might die, and said, It is enough! Now, Jehovah, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers!
And as he lay and slept under a broom tree, behold an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
And he looked, and behold, by his head was a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and turned and lay down.
And the Angel of Jehovah came back the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for you.
And he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights as far as Horeb, the mountain of God.
And there he came into a cave, and spent the night there; and behold, the Word of Jehovah came to him, and He said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?
And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.
And He said, Go out, and stand on the mountain before Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before Jehovah, but Jehovah was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but Jehovah was not in the earthquake;
and after the earthquake a fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire; and after the fire a whisper of a small voice.
And so it was, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave; and behold, a voice came to him, and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?
And he said, I have been very zealous for Jehovah the God of Hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek my soul, to take it away.
And Jehovah said to him: Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you have come there, anoint Hazael as king over Syria.
Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.
It shall be that whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall kill.
Yet I have left in Israel seven thousand, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.
So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.
And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow after you. And he said to him, Turn and go back, for what have I done to you?
So Elisha turned back from after him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen’s implements, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah, and served him.
Now Ben-Hadad the king of Syria gathered all his forces together; thirty-two kings were with him, with horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, and made war against it.
And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says Ben-Hadad:
Your silver and your gold are mine; your lovely wives and children are mine.
And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, just as you say, I and all that I have are yours.
And the messengers came back and said, Thus says Ben-Hadad, saying, Indeed I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children;
but I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants. And it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they shall put it in their hands and take it away.
So the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Notice, please, and see how this man seeks evil, for he sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold; and I have not withheld from him.
And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do not listen or consent.
Therefore he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you sent for to your servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers departed and brought back word to him.
And Ben-Hadad sent to him and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if enough dust is left of Samaria for a handful for each of the people who follow me.
And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not the one who puts on his armor boast like the one who takes it off.
And it happened when Ben-Hadad heard this message, as he and the kings were drinking at the booths, that he said to his servants, Get ready. And they stationed themselves against the city.
And behold, a certain prophet approached Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I am delivering it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
So Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says Jehovah: By the young rulers of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? And he answered, You.
Then he mustered the young rulers of the provinces, and there were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered all the people, all the sons of Israel; seven thousand.
So they went out at noon. Meanwhile Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two kings helping him were getting drunk in the booths.
And the young rulers of the provinces went out first. And Ben-Hadad sent out, and they reported to him, saying, Men have come out of Samaria!
And he said, If they have come out for peace, take them alive; and if they have come out for war, take them alive.
And the young rulers of the provinces went out of the city with the army which followed them.
And each one struck his man; so the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great slaughter.
And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, Go, strengthen yourself; take note, and see what you should do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you.
And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills. Therefore they were stronger than us; but if we fight against them in the plain, will we not be stronger than them.
So do this thing: Remove the kings, each from his place, and put governors in their places;
and you shall muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. Then we shall fight against them in the plain; surely we will be stronger than them. And he heeded their voice and did so.
So it was, at the turn of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
And the sons of Israel were mustered and given provisions, and they went against them. Now the sons of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, while the Syrians filled the land.
And a man of God came and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus says Jehovah: Because the Syrians have said, Jehovah is God of the hills, but He is not God of the valleys, therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
And they encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was that on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians in one day.
And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; where a wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men who were left. And Ben-Hadad fled and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please, let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes around our heads, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will preserve alive your soul.
So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes around their heads, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-Hadad says, Please preserve my soul alive. And he said, Is he still alive? He is my brother.
Now the men observed carefully, and they quickly grasped at this word and said, Your brother Ben-Hadad. And he said, Go, bring him. Then Ben-Hadad came out to him; and he had him come up into the chariot.
And Ben-Hadad said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria. And Ahab said, I will send you away with this treaty. So he made a treaty with him and sent him away.
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor, By the Word of Jehovah, Strike me, please. And the man refused to strike him.
And he said to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, behold, as soon as you depart from me, a lion shall kill you. And as soon as he left him, a lion found him and killed him.
And he found another man, and said, Strike me, please. So the man struck him, to strike and wound him.
And the prophet departed and waited for the king by the road, and disguised himself with a cover over his eyes.
And as the king passed by, he cried out to the king and said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle; and there, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said, Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your soul shall be for his soul, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.
And while your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it.
And he hastened to take the covering away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Because you have sent away out of your hand a man whom I devoted to utter destruction, therefore your soul shall go for his soul, and your people for his people.
So the king of Israel went to his house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.
And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. Or, if it is good in your eyes, I will give you its price in money.
But Naboth said to Ahab, Jehovah forbid that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!
So Ahab went into his house sullen and angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food.
And Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sullen that you are not eating food?
And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for it. And he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.
And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now rule over Israel? Arise, eat food, and let your heart be joyful. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
And she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth.
She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the people;
and seat two men, sons of worthlessness, before him to bear witness against him, saying, You have blasphemed God and the king. Then take him out, and stone him, that he may die.
So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth at the head of the people.
And two men, sons of worthlessness, came in and sat before him; and the men of worthlessness testified against him, against Naboth, before the people, saying, Naboth has blasphemed God and the king! Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died.
Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.
And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but has died.
So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth had died, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
And the Word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who lives in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it.
And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Have you murdered and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah: In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.
So Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah:
Behold, I shall bring evil upon you. I shall take away your posterity, and shall cut off from Ahab in Israel everyone who urinates against a wall, both bond and free.
I have delivered up your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked Me to anger, and made Israel sin.
And concerning Jezebel Jehovah also spoke, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
The dogs shall eat whoever of Ahab dies in the city, and the birds of the heavens shall eat whoever dies in the field.
Surely there had not been one like Ahab who had sold himself to do wickedness in the eyes of Jehovah, which his wife Jezebel had instigated.
And he did exceedingly abominably to follow after the idols, according to all that the Amorites had done, whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and walked about softly.
And the Word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring about the evil in his days; but in the days of his son I will bring about the evil upon his house.
Now three years passed without war between Syria and Israel.
And it came to pass, in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel.
And the king of Israel said to his servants, Have you known that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, but we are being inactive to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth Gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire at the Word of Jehovah today.
So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth Gilead to fight, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so!
Then the king of Israel summoned a certain official and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imlah quickly!
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne, at a vacant spot at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to destroy them.
And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the king’s hand.
And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets with one mouth are agreeable to the king. Please, let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak pleasant things.
And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever Jehovah says to me, that I will speak.
So he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall we refrain? And he answered him, Go and prosper, for Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king!
And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure you to speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
Then he said, I have seen all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep having no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
And Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of Heaven standing by, on His right hand and on His left.
And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one said this, and another was saying that.
Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him.
And Jehovah said to him, In what way? And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all his prophets. And Jehovah said, You shall entice him, and also prevail. Go out and do so.
Therefore now behold, Jehovah has put a spirit of falsehood in the mouth of all these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken calamity against you.
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the spirit from Jehovah go from me to speak to you?
And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!
So the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son;
and say, Thus says the king: Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I come in peace.
And Micaiah said, If you return to come back in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, All you people, pay attention!
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two commanders of his chariots, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.
And so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel! Therefore they turned aside to fight against him, and Jehoshaphat cried out.
And it happened, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.
And the battle increased that day; and the king was propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians, and died at evening. And the blood ran out from the wound onto the floor of the chariot.
And as the sun was going down, a shout went throughout the camp, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own land!
So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria.
And someone washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, the ivory house which he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
Jehoshaphat the son of Asa had become king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
And he walked in all the ways of his father Asa. He did not turn aside from them, doing what was right in the eyes of Jehovah. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for the people offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.
Also Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the might that he showed, and how he made war, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
And the rest of the male temple prostitutes, who had remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed out of the land.
There was then no king in Edom, only a deputy of the king.
Jehoshaphat had made merchant ships to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
Ahaziah the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father and in the ways of his mother and in the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin;
for he served Baal and bowed down to him, and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger, according to all that his father had done.
Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria, and was ill; so he sent messengers and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.
And the Angel of Jehovah spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?
Now therefore, thus says Jehovah: You shall not come down from the bed on which you have gone up, but you shall die the death. And Elijah departed.
And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have you come back?
And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed upon which you have gone up, but you shall die the death.
And he said to them, What kind of man was it who came up to meet you and spoke to you these words?
So they answered him, A hairy man girded with a leather waistband around his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
Then the king sent to him a commander of fifty with his fifty. So he went up to him; and behold, he was sitting on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him: Man of God, the king has said, Come down!
And Elijah answered and said to the commander of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty. And fire came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.
Then he sent to him another commander of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him: Man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly!
And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the heavens and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from the heavens and consumed him and his fifty.
Again, he sent a third commander of fifty with his fifty. And the third commander of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and implored him, and said to him: Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your eyes.
Behold, fire has come down from the heavens and burned up the first two commanders of fifties with their fifties. But let my life now be precious in your eyes.
And the Angel of Jehovah said to Elijah, Go down with him; do not be afraid of him. So he arose and went down with him to the king.
And he said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His Word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed upon which you have gone up, but you shall die the death.
So Ahaziah died according to the Word of Jehovah which Elijah had spoken. Because he had no son, Jehoram became king in his place, in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
And it came to pass, when Jehovah was about to take Elijah up into Heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah and Elisha went from Gilgal.
Then Elijah said to Elisha, Stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to Bethel. But Elisha said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they went down to Bethel.
And the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he said, Yes, I know; keep silent!
Then Elijah said to him, Elisha, stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to Jericho. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So they came to Jericho.
And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, Do you know that Jehovah will take away your master from over you today? And he answered, Yes, I know; keep silent!
Then Elijah said to him, Stay here, please, for Jehovah has sent me on to the Jordan. But he said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you! So the two of them went on.
And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in view of them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.
And Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask! What shall I do for you, before I am taken away from you? And Elisha said, Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.
And he said, You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.
And it happened as they continued on and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into Heaven.
And Elisha was watching and crying out, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces.
He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
And he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, Where is Jehovah the God of Elijah? And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.
And when the sons of the prophets from Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah rests upon Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.
And they said to him, Behold now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.
And when they pressed him till he was ashamed, he said, Send! So they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.
And when they came back to him (for he had stayed in Jericho), he said to them, Did I not say to you, Do not go?
And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.
And he said, Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it. So they brought it to him.
And he went out to the spring of the water, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus says Jehovah: I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.
Thus the waters remain healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he had spoken.
And he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some little boys came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!
And he turned around and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of Jehovah. And two bears came out of the forest and ripped apart forty-two of the children.
And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.
Now Mesha the king of Moab was a raiser of sheep, and he had brought to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.
But it happened, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
So King Jehoram went out of Samaria that day and mustered all of Israel.
And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab? And he said, I will go up; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.
And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, By way of the wilderness of Edom.
So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of a seven days’ journey; and there was no water for the camp, nor for the cattle at their feet.
And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Jehovah by him? So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
And Jehoshaphat said, The Word of Jehovah is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother. But the king of Israel said to him, No, for Jehovah has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
And Elisha said, As Jehovah of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not pay attention to you, nor look at you.
But now bring me a minstrel. And it happened, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Jehovah came upon him.
And he said, Thus says Jehovah: Make this valley full of ditches.
For thus says Jehovah: You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet the valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.
And this is but a slight thing in the eyes of Jehovah; He has also delivered the Moabites into your hand.
Also you shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.
And it happened in the morning, when the grain offering was offered, that behold, water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
And when all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they took their stand at the border.
And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood.
And they said, This is blood; the kings have laid waste to make desolate, and have struck down one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoils!
So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered, striking to kill the Moabites.
And they tore down the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of Kir Haraseth. However the slingers surrounded and struck it.
And when the king of Moab saw that the battle had prevailed against him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.
Then he took his firstborn son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel; so they departed from him and returned to their own land.
Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared Jehovah. And the creditor is coming to take my two children to be his slaves.
And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house? And she said, Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a flask of oil.
Then he said, Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors; empty vessels; do not gather just a few.
And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; and pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.
So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.
And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.
Then she came and reported to the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.
And it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she prevailed upon him to eat food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn aside there to eat food.
And she said to her husband, Behold now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.
Please, let us make a small walled upper room; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; and it shall be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn aside there.
And the day came that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.
And he said to Gehazi his servant, Summon this Shunammite. And when he had summoned her, she stood before him.
And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What shall I do for you? Shall I speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army? She answered, I am dwelling among my own people.
So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly, she has no son, and her husband is old.
And he said, Summon her. When he had summoned her, she stood in the doorway.
And he said, At the appointed time according to the time of life you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!
And the woman conceived and bore a son at the appointed time, according to the time of life, as Elisha had spoken to her.
When the child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.
And he said to his father, My head, my head! So he said to a servant, Carry him to his mother.
When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and died.
And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.
And she called to her husband, and said, Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.
And he said, Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the sabbath. And she said, It will be well.
And she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Lead on and go; do not slacken the pace for me unless I say so.
So she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. And so it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, Behold, the Shunammite!
Please run now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.
And when she came to the man of God at the hill, she took hold of his feet; and Gehazi came near to push her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is bitter, and Jehovah has hidden it from me, and has not told me.
And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?
Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the boy.
And the mother of the boy said, As Jehovah lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So he arose and went after her.
And Gehazi went on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the boy; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and reported to him, saying, The boy has not awakened.
And when Elisha came into the house, behold, the boy was dead, lying on his bed.
So he went in, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed unto Jehovah.
And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.
He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the boy sneezed seven times, and the boy opened his eyes.
And he summoned Gehazi and said, Summon this Shunammite. So he summoned her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.
And she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground, and took up her son and went out.
And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Now there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.
And one of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew, though they did not know what they were.
And they poured out for the men to eat. And it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, Man of God, there is death in the pot! And they could not eat it.
So he said, Then bring some flour. And he put it into the pot, and said, Pour it out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
And a man came from Baal Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and fresh heads of grain in his sack. And he said, Give it to the people, that they may eat.
But his servant said, What? Shall I set this before one hundred men? He said again, Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says Jehovah: They shall eat and have some left over.
So he set it before them; and they ate and had some left over, according to the Word of Jehovah.
Now Naaman, a chief of the army of the king of Syria, was a great and honorable man before his master, because by him Jehovah had given deliverance to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, but a leper.
And the Syrians had gone out on raids, and had brought back captive a little girl from the land of Israel; and she was before Naaman’s wife.
And she said to her mistress, If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria! For he would take away his leprosy.
And he went in and told his master, saying, Thus and thus has spoken the girl, who is from the land of Israel.
And the king of Syria said, Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. So he departed and took in his hand ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing.
Then he came to the king of Israel with the letter which said, As this letter comes to you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may take away his leprosy.
And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, Am I God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to take away his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.
So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
So Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and stood at the door of Elisha’s house.
And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and you shall be clean.
But Naaman was furious, and went away and said, Behold I thought He would go forth to come out to me, and would have stood and called upon the name of Jehovah his God, and waved his hand over the place, and taken away the leprosy.
Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
And his servants came near and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more then, when he says to you, Wash, and be clean?
So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy, and he was clean.
And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take a gift from your servant.
But he said, As Jehovah lives, before whom I stand, I shall take nothing. And he pressed him to take it, but he refused.
So Naaman said, Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but unto Jehovah.
Yet in this thing may Jehovah pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he supports himself on my hand, and I bow down in the house of Rimmon; when I bow down in the house of Rimmon, may Jehovah please pardon your servant in this thing.
And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a short distance.
But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving from his hands what he brought; but as Jehovah lives, I will run after him and take something from him.
So Gehazi ran after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
And he said, All is well. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.
And Naaman said, Please, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him.
And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and deposited them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.
And he went in and stood before his master; and Elisha said to him, Where have you been, Gehazi? And he said, Your servant did not go anywhere.
Then he said to him, Did not my heart go with you when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants?
Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your seed always. And he went out from his presence leprous as snow.
And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, See now, the place where we are dwelling with you is too small for us.
Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell. So he answered, Go.
Then one of them said, Please consent to go with your servants. And he answered, I will go.
So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.
But as one was cutting down a log, the iron ax head fell into the water; and he cried out and said, Alas, master! For it was borrowed.
And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. So he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron floated.
Therefore he said, Pick it up for yourself. So he extended his hand and took it.
Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, My camp will be in such and such a place.
And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.
Then the king of Israel sent someone to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.
Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was enraged over this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, Will you not report to me which of us is for the king of Israel?
And one of his servants said, No one, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.
So he said, Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him. And it was reported to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.
And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, behold, the army was surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?
So he answered, Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.
And Elisha prayed, and said, Jehovah, I pray, open his eyes that he may see. And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to Jehovah, and said, Strike this people, I pray, with blindness. And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek. But he led them to Samaria.
And so it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, Jehovah, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And Jehovah opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria!
Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?
But he answered, You shall not smite them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.
So he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the marauding bands from Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.
And there was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver.
And as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king!
And he said, If Jehovah does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?
And the king said to her, What is troubling you? And she answered, This woman said to me, Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, Give your son, that we may eat him; but she hid her son.
And it happened when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth inside on his flesh.
Then he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today.
And Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man before him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?
And while he was still talking with them, behold, the messenger was coming down to him; and he said, Behold, this evil is from Jehovah; why should I wait for Jehovah any longer?
Then Elisha said, Hear the Word of Jehovah. Thus says Jehovah: Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.
So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, Behold, if Jehovah would make windows in the heavens, could this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.
Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, Why are we sitting here until we will have died?
If we say, We will enter the city, the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we are also dead. Now therefore, come, let us fall to the camp of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall have died.
And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the edge of the Syrian camp, behold, no one was there.
For Jehovah had caused the camp of the Syrians to hear the sound of chariots and the sound of horses, the sound of a great army; so they said to one another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to come upon us!
Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp; their tents, their horses, and their donkeys; and they fled for their lives.
And when the lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it.
Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we are remaining silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king’s household.
So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went to the Syrian camp, and behold, no one was there, no voice of man; only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents as they were.
And the gatekeepers called out, and they reported it to the king’s household inside.
So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, Let me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.
And one of his servants answered and said, Please, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Behold, they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or behold, they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see.
Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them after the Syrian camp, saying, Go and see.
And they went after them to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.
Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians. And a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the Word of Jehovah.
Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate. But the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had spoken, who had spoken when the king came down to him.
So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel, shall be sold tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
And that officer had answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, if Jehovah would make windows in the heavens, could such a thing be? And he had said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.
Thus it happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gate, and he died.
Then Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for Jehovah has called for a famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years.
So the woman arose and did according to the word of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.
And it came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to cry out to the king for her house and for her land.
Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, please, all the great things that Elisha has done.
And it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that behold, the woman whose son he had restored to life, was crying out to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.
And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed a certain officer to her, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the proceeds of the fields from the day that she left the land until now.
And Elisha came to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was reported to him, saying, The man of God has come here.
And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I remain alive of this disease?
So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, Shall I remain alive of this disease?
And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, You shall live to remain alive. However Jehovah has shown me that he shall die the death.
Then he stood still and set his face until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.
And Hazael said, Why is my lord weeping? He answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.
And Hazael said, But what is your servant; a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, Jehovah has shown me that you will become king over Syria.
And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And he answered, He told me that you will live to remain alive.
But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread it over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.
Now in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat having been king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
Yet Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for the sake of his servant David, as He had promised him to give a lamp to him and his sons all their days.
In his days Edom revolted against the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
So Joram passed over to Zair, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
Thus Edom has been in revolt against the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab, for he was the son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians struck Joram.
Then King Joram went back to Jezreel to be healed from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
And Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
Now when you have come there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among his brothers. And when you have brought him to an inner room,
take the flask of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus says Jehovah: I have anointed you king over Israel. And when you have opened the door and fled, do not delay.
So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.
And when he came in, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting. And he said, I have a message for you, commander. And Jehu said, For which one of us? And he said, For you, commander.
And he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of Jehovah, over Israel.
And you shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah, at the hand of Jezebel.
For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I shall cut off from Ahab all those who urinate against a wall in Israel, both bond and free.
Thus I shall make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.
The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot of ground at Jezreel, for there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled.
Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and one of them said to him, Is all well? Why did this madman come to you? And he said to them, You know the man and his talk.
And they said, A lie! Tell us now. So he said, Thus and thus he has spoken to me, saying, Thus says Jehovah: I have anointed you king over Israel.
Then each man hastened to take his garment and put it under him on the top of the steps; and they blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king!
So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria.
But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to be healed from the wounds with which the Syrians had struck him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If you are so minded, let no one leave or escape from the city to go and report it in Jezreel.
So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram was lying there; and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
Now a watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a multitude. And Joram said, Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
So the horseman went to meet him, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me. So the watchman reported, saying, The messenger went to them, but has not returned.
Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.
So the watchman reported, saying, He went up to them and has not returned; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives madly!
Then Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him on the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
And it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? So he answered, What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft are so many?
Then Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah, Treachery, O Ahaziah!
And Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.
Then Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, Pick him up, and throw him into the parcel of the land of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that Jehovah had laid this burden upon him:
Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says Jehovah, and I will repay you in this plot, says Jehovah. Now therefore, take and throw him on the plot of ground, according to the Word of Jehovah.
And when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him, and said, Strike him also in the chariot, at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David.
In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.
Now when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she put black paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked down through a window.
And as Jehu had entered at the gate, she said, Is it peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?
And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three officials looked down at him.
And he said, Throw her down! So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her.
And when he came in, he ate and drank. Then he said, Go now, see to this accursed woman, and bury her, for she was a king’s daughter.
And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
Therefore they came back and reported to him. And he said, This is the Word of Jehovah, which He has spoken by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;
and the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the land, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those rearing Ahab’s sons, saying:
Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons,
choose the best and most upright of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.
But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings have not stood before him; how then can we stand?
And he who was over the house, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those rearing the sons, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your eyes.
Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying: If you are for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow. Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were rearing them.
So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons and slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.
And a messenger came and reported to him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.
And it came about in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, You are righteous. Behold, I have conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these?
Know now that nothing has fallen to the earth of the Word of Jehovah which Jehovah has spoken concerning the house of Ahab; for Jehovah has done what He has spoken by the hand of His servant Elijah.
Thus Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his acquaintances and his priests, until he left him no one remaining.
And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at the house of the shepherds at Beth Eked,
Jehu met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.
And he said, Take them alive! So they took them alive, and killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.
And when he departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab, coming to meet him; and he blessed him and said to him, Is your heart upright, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. Jehu said, If it is, give me your hand. So he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
Then he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Jehovah. So they made him ride in his chariot.
And when he came to Samaria, he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to Elijah.
Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu shall serve him much.
Now therefore, call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live. But Jehu acted with cunning, in order to destroy those serving Baal.
And Jehu said, Consecrate a solemn assembly to Baal. So they proclaimed it.
Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all those serving Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other.
And he said to the one over the wardrobe, Bring out the vestments for all those serving Baal. So he brought out vestments for them.
And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the house of Baal, and said to those serving Baal, Search and see that no servants of Jehovah are here with you, but only those serving Baal.
So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men outside, and had said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, whoever lets him escape, it shall be his soul for the soul of the other.
Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the runners and the officers, Go in and strike them; let no one come out! And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the runners and the officers threw them out, and went into the city of the house of Baal.
And they brought the sacred pillars out of the house of Baal and burned them.
Then they broke down the sacred pillar of Baal, and tore down the house of Baal and made it an outhouse to this day.
Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
However Jehu did not turn away from after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, that is, from the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.
And Jehovah said to Jehu, Because you have done well in doing what is right in My eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.
But Jehu took no heed to walk in the Law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.
In those days Jehovah began to cut off Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the territory of Israel
from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead; Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh; from Aroer, which is by the River Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place.
And the days that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria were twenty-eight years.
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son had died, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.
But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed.
So he was hidden with her in the house of Jehovah for six years, while Athaliah was reigning over the land.
In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the commanders of hundreds, the mercenaries and runners, and brought them into the house of Jehovah to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of Jehovah, and showed them the king’s son.
And he commanded them, saying, This is what you shall do: One-third of you who come on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house,
one-third shall be at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the runners. You shall keep the watch of the house by turns.
The two parts of you who go out on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah for the king.
And you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You shall be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.
Thus the commanders of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were going in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
And the priest gave the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of Jehovah.
And the runners stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, by the altar and the house.
And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and gave him the Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, Long live the king!
Now when Athaliah heard the sound of the runners and the people, she came to the people in the house of Jehovah.
And when she looked, behold, the king was standing by the pillar according to the custom; and the rulers and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, Treason! Treason!
And Jehoiada the priest commanded the commanders of the hundreds, those mustering the army, and said to them, Take her outside from the ranks of the house, and whoever follows after her, slay with the sword. For the priest had said, Do not let her be killed in the house of Jehovah.
So they laid hands on her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance into the king’s house, and there she was put to death.
And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah, the king, and the people, to be the people of Jehovah; and also between the king and the people.
And all the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah.
And he took the commanders of hundreds, the mercenaries, the runners, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of Jehovah, and went by way of the gate of the runners to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
And all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was at peace, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword in the king’s house.
Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days in which Jehoiada the priest had instructed him.
But the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the consecrated things that are brought into the house of Jehovah, each man’s poll tax money, each man’s valuation money, and all the money that a man purposes in his heart to bring into the house of Jehovah;
let the priests take it themselves, each from his acquaintance; and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach is found.
But it was so, by the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, that the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
So King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests, and said to them, Why have you not repaired the breaches of the house? Now therefore, do not take more money from your acquaintances, but give it for repairing the breaches of the house.
And the priests agreed that they would neither receive more money from the people, nor repair the breaches of the house.
And Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Jehovah; and the priests who kept the door put there all the money brought into the house of Jehovah.
So it was, whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and put it in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah.
Then they gave the money, which had been weighed out, into the hands of those doing the work, who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they brought it out to the craftsmen and builders who worked on the house of Jehovah,
and to masons and stonecutters, and for buying timber and hewn stone, to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah, and for all that was brought out to make the house strong.
However there were not made for the house of Jehovah basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any articles of gold or articles of silver, from the money brought into the house of Jehovah;
for they gave it towards the business of doing the work, to restore the house of Jehovah with it.
Moreover they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they were dealing faithfully.
The money from the trespass offerings and the money from the sin offerings was not brought into the house of Jehovah. It belonged to the priests.
Then Hazael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath, and took it; and then Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
And Jehoash king of Judah took all the consecrated things that his fathers, Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had set apart, and his own consecrated things, and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and in the king’s house, and sent them to Hazael king of Syria. Then he went away from Jerusalem.
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
And his servants rose up and conspired treason, and killed Joash in the house of the Millo, which goes down to Silla.
For Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him. So he died, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and followed after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. He did not depart from them.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all their days.
So Jehoahaz entreated Jehovah, and Jehovah gave heed to his face; for He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
And Jehovah gave Israel a savior, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before.
Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the groves also remained in Samaria.
For he did not leave to Jehoahaz any of the people except for fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash his son reigned in his place.
In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned sixteen years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, but walked in them.
Now the rest of the acts of Joash, all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Joash rested with his fathers. And Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
Now Elisha had become sick with the illness from which he would die. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!
And Elisha said to him, Take a bow and some arrows. So he took himself a bow and some arrows.
And he said to the king of Israel, Put your hand on the bow. So he put his hand on it, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
And he said, Open the east window; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, The arrow of Jehovah’s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians at Aphek till you have destroyed them.
Then he said, Take the arrows; so he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike the ground; so he struck three times, and stopped.
And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria to finish them off! But now you will strike Syria only three times.
And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the beginning of the year.
And so it was, as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw a band of raiders; and they threw the man into the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let go and hit the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood up on his feet.
And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
But Jehovah was gracious to them, had compassion on them, and regarded them, because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence.
Then Hazael king of Syria died, and Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place.
And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took back from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father in battle. Three times Joash struck him and restored the cities of Israel.
In the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, became king.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, yet not like his father David; he did everything as his father Joash had done.
However the high places were not taken away, and the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
And it happened, as soon as the kingdom had been secured in his hand, that he struck his servants who had killed his father the king.
But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which Jehovah had commanded, saying, Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.
He killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel to this day.
Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
You have attacked to strike Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at your house; why stir yourself up over evil so that you fall, you and Judah with you?
But Amaziah would not listen. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah looked each other in the face at Beth Shemesh of Judah.
And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.
And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.
And he took all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did; his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.
And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
And they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.
And they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.
And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.
In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
He restored the territory of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the Word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who was from Gath Hepher.
For Jehovah saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter; and whether bond or free, there was no helper for Israel.
And Jehovah had not spoken to blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did; his might, how he made war, and how he recovered for Israel from Damascus and Hamath what had belonged to Judah; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son reigned in his place.
In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, became king.
He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done,
except that the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
And Jehovah struck the king, so that he was a leper until the day of his death; so he dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king’s son was over the house, judging the people of the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Azariah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And Jotham his son reigned in his place.
In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his fathers had done; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and struck and killed him in front of the people, and reigned in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
This was the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken to Jehu, saying, Your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. And so it was.
Shallum the son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a month of days in Samaria.
For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and killed him; and reigned in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the treason he had conspired, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
Menahem struck Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory from Tirzah; because they did not open to him, therefore he struck it. All the pregnant women he ripped open.
In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
And Pul king of Assyria came against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to strengthen the kingdom under his hand.
And Menahem brought out the money from Israel, from all the mighty men of wealth, from each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and did not stay there in the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
So Menahem rested with his fathers. And Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.
In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
Then Pekah the son of Remaliah, an officer of his, conspired against him and struck him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, along with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men of Gilead. He killed him and reigned in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah; he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin.
In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria.
Then Hoshea the son of Elah conspired treason against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck and killed him; and he reigned in his place in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
However the high places were not removed; the people were still sacrificing and burning incense on the high places. He built the Upper Gate of the house of Jehovah.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
In those days Jehovah began to send Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah.
So Jotham rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God, as his father David had done.
But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He also made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to make war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.
At that time Rezin king of Syria restored Elath to Syria, and cleared out the men of Judah from Elath. Then the Syrians went to Elath, and dwell there to this day.
So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.
And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Jehovah, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent it as a present to the king of Assyria.
So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it, carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.
Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.
And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. And Urijah the priest had it made before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.
And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king approached the altar and went up to it.
So he sacrificed his burnt offering with smoke and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.
He also brought the bronze altar from before Jehovah, from the front of the house, from between his altar and the house of Jehovah; and put it on the north side of his altar.
And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, On the great new altar burn the morning burnt offering with smoke, the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt offering, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.
Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz had commanded.
And King Ahaz cut off the rims of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stones.
And the covered Sabbath structure which they had built in the house, he removed from the house of Jehovah, along with the king’s outer entrance, before the king of Assyria.
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea became his servant, and paid him tribute.
And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
Now the king of Assyria went throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years.
In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria, and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
For so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they feared other gods,
and had walked in the statutes of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
And the children of Israel secretly did things against Jehovah their God that were not right, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from watchtower to fortified city.
They set up for themselves sacred pillars and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.
There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom Jehovah had carried away before them, and did evil things to provoke Jehovah to anger;
for they served idols, of which Jehovah had said to them, You shall not do this thing.
Yet Jehovah testified against Israel and against Judah, by the hand of all of His prophets and every seer, saying, Turn away from your evil ways, and keep My commandments and My statutes, according to all the Law which I have commanded your fathers, and which I have sent to you by the hand of My servants the prophets.
Nevertheless they would not hear, but stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who had not believed in Jehovah their God.
And they rejected His statutes and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He had testified against them; they went after their vanities, became vain, and went after the nations who were all around them, concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them.
And they left all the commandments of Jehovah their God, made for themselves molten images, two calves, made a grove and bowed down to all the host of the heavens, and served Baal.
And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, practiced divination of witchcraft and fortunetelling, and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.
Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel, and removed them away from before His face; there was no one left but only the tribe of Judah.
Also Judah did not keep the commandments of Jehovah their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made.
And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel, afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them away from before His face.
For He tore Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. And Jeroboam drove Israel from following after Jehovah, and made them sin a great sin.
For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they have not departed from them,
until Jehovah had removed Israel from before His face, as He had said by all His servants the prophets. Thus Israel was carried away from their own land into Assyria, as it is this day.
Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities.
And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they did not fear Jehovah; therefore Jehovah sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the ordinances of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them because they do not know the ordinances of the God of the land.
So the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you have brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land.
Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah.
However nation by nation they continued making gods of their own, and put them in the houses on the high places which those from Samaria had made, nation by nation in the cities where they were living.
The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima,
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
So they feared Jehovah; and from among all of them they appointed for themselves priests of the high places, who attended to the houses of the high places for them.
They feared Jehovah, and also served their own gods; according to the manner of the nations from where they were carried away.
To this day they continue doing according to the former manner; they do not fear Jehovah, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the Law and commandments which Jehovah has commanded the sons of Jacob, whom He had ordained with the name, Israel;
with whom Jehovah had made a covenant and charged them, saying: You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them;
but Jehovah, who has brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm, Him you shall fear, to Him you shall bow down, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice.
And the statutes, the ordinances, the Law, and the commandments which He has written for you, you shall take heed to do forever; you shall not fear other gods.
And the covenant that I have made with you, you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods.
But Jehovah your God you shall fear; and He shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
However they have not obeyed, but are doing according to their former manner.
Thus these nations feared Jehovah, while also serving their graven images. And their children and their children’s children have continued doing as their fathers have done, even to this day.
Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father David had done.
He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, chopped down the groves and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it Nehushtan.
He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel, so that after him was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him.
For he clung to Jehovah; he did not turn aside from following after Him, but kept His commandments, which Jehovah had commanded Moses.
Jehovah was with him; he prospered wherever he went. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
He struck the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, from watchtower to fortified city.
And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it.
And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was captured.
And the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and led them to Halah and the Habor, the River of Gozan, and to the cities of the Medes,
because they had not obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, but transgressed His covenant and all that Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded; they had neither heeded nor done them.
And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose upon me I will endure. And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah and in the treasuries of the king’s house.
At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the temple of Jehovah, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
And the king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish, with great forces against Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they had come up, they went and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which was on the highway to the Fuller’s Field.
And when they had called out to the king, Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to them.
And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in which you have trusted?
You have spoken of having counsel and power for war; but they are mere words of the lips. And in whom have you trusted, that you have rebelled against me?
Now behold, you have trusted in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all those trusting in him.
But if you say to me, We have trusted in Jehovah our God, is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall bow down before this altar in Jerusalem?
Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses; if you are able on your part to put riders on them!
How then will you turn away the face of one governor of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
Have I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it? Jehovah has said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in the Jewish language in the hearing of the people on the wall.
But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not also to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?
Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
Thus says the king: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand;
nor let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will rescue to deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: Make a peace treaty and come out to me; and every one of you shall eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you shall drink the waters of his own cistern;
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey, that you may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, lest he persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us.
Have any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
But the people kept quiet and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, Do not answer him.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and rebuke, and contempt; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring forth.
It may be that Jehovah your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is found left.
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
And Isaiah said to them, Thus you shall say to your master, Thus says Jehovah: Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
And Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish.
And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he has come out to wage war with you. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered?
Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?
Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.
And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah, and said: O Jehovah the God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and earth.
Extend Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
Truly, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,
and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands; wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them.
Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, I pray, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are Jehovah God, You alone.
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I have heard that which you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria.
This is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem Has shaken her head behind you!
Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!
By your messengers you have reproached the Lord, and said: By the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, next to Lebanon; I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees; I will enter the ends of its lodging places, into its forest at Carmel.
I have dug and drunk strange waters, and with the soles of my feet I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt.
Have you not heard? From long ago I have made it, and from ancient times I have formed it. Now I have brought it to pass, that you should crush fortified cities into heaps of ruins.
Therefore their inhabitants were short handed; they were shattered and put to shame; they were as the grass of the field and the green herb, as the grass on the housetops and grain blighted before it is grown.
But I know your abode, your going out and your coming in, and your rage against Me.
Because your rage against Me and your arrogance have come up into My ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way which you have come.
This shall be a sign to you: You shall eat this year such as grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from the same; also in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and those who escape from Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts shall do this.
Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor build a siege mound against it.
By the way that he came, by the same shall he return; and he shall not come into this city, says Jehovah.
For I have defended this city, to save it for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.
And it came to pass that night that the Angel of Jehovah went out, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, behold, all of them were dead corpses.
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
Now it came to pass, as he was bowing down in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
In those days Hezekiah had become sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Set your house in order, for you are dying, and shall not live.
And he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Jehovah, saying,
Remember now, O Jehovah, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what was good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wailed with great weeping.
And it happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the Word of Jehovah came to him, saying,
Return and say to Hezekiah the ruler of My people, Thus says Jehovah the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of Jehovah.
And I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of My servant David.
And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. So they took and laid it on the boil, and he lived.
And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What is the sign that Jehovah will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah the third day?
And Isaiah said, This is the sign to you from Jehovah, that Jehovah will do the thing which He has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go backward ten steps?
And Hezekiah answered, It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten steps; no, but let the shadow go backward ten steps.
So Isaiah the prophet cried out to Jehovah, and He brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.
At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
And Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures; the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all the house of his weapons; all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say, and from where did they come to you? So Hezekiah said, They came from a distant land, from Babylon.
And he said, What have they seen in your house? So Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the Word of Jehovah:
Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have laid in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
And they shall take away some of your sons who shall come forth from you, whom you shall beget; and they shall be officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.
And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The Word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good! For he thought, Will there not be peace and truth in my days?
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah; all his might, and how he made a pool and a tunnel and brought water into the city; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he bowed down to all the host of the heavens and served them.
He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem I will put My name.
And he built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
He also made his son pass through the fire, practiced witchcraft and fortunetelling, and consulted necromancers and mediums. He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.
And he set a graven image in the grove that he had made, in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;
and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I have given to their fathers; only if they take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the Law that My servant Moses has commanded them.
But they have paid no attention, and Manasseh caused them to err, to do more evil than the nations whom Jehovah had destroyed before the children of Israel.
And Jehovah spoke by His servants the prophets, saying,
Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (he has acted more wickedly than all the Amorites who were before him, and has also made Judah sin with his idols),
therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
And I shall stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; I shall wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it face down.
Thus I will forsake the remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become spoils and plunder to all their enemies,
because they have done evil in My eyes, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers had come out of Egypt, even to this day.
Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to the other, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh; all that he did, and the sin that he sinned; are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had done.
Thus he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and bowed down to them.
He forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of Jehovah.
Then the servants of Amon conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house.
But the people of the land struck all those conspiring against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son reigned in his place.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in all the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
And it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of Jehovah, saying:
Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of Jehovah, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.
And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of Jehovah; let them give it to those who are in the house of Jehovah doing the work, to repair the breaches of the house;
to the craftsmen and builders and masons; and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.
However there was no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they were dealing faithfully.
Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king, saying, Your servants have gathered the money found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who are doing the work, who oversee the house of Jehovah.
And Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
And it happened, when the king heard the Words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes.
And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,
Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.
So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. (She dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke with her.
And she said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants; all the Words of the Book which the king of Judah has read;
because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath has been kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
But as for the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall say to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Concerning the words which you have heard;
because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Jehovah when you heard what I have spoken against this place and against its inhabitants, that they would become a desolation and a curse, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.
Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil that I am bringing upon this place. So they brought back word to the king.
And the king sent them and they gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to him.
And the king went up to the house of Jehovah with all the men of Judah, and with him all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the priests and the prophets and all the people, both small and great. And he read in their ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which was found in the house of Jehovah.
Then the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Jehovah, to follow Jehovah and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the Words of this covenant that were written in this Book. And all the people stood for the covenant.
And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of Jehovah all the articles that were made for Baal, for the grove, and for all the host of the heavens; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.
And he put an end to the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had dedicated to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those burning incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the zodiac, and to all the host of the heavens.
And he brought out the grove from the house of Jehovah, to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned it at the Brook Kidron and pulverized the ashes, and threw its ashes on the graves of the sons of the people.
And he tore down the houses of the male temple prostitutes that were in the house of Jehovah, where the women were weaving shelters for the grove.
And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba; also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were to one’s left of the city gate.
Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.
And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of the sons of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech.
And he did away with the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of Jehovah, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the official who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
The altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah, the king beat them down and ran and hurled their dust into the Brook Kidron.
And the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtaroth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon.
And he broke in pieces the sacred pillars and chopped down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat had made, by which he had made Israel to sin, both that altar and the high place he tore down; and he burned the high place and pulverized it to dust, and burned the grove.
And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the Word of Jehovah which the man of God had proclaimed, who had proclaimed these things.
Then he said, What monument is this that I see? And the men of the city said to him, It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.
And he said, Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that had come from Samaria.
And Josiah also took away all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke to anger; and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done at Bethel.
And he slaughtered all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.
And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the Passover to Jehovah your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.
Surely such a Passover had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel nor the kings of Judah.
It was in the eighteenth year of King Josiah that this Passover was observed unto Jehovah in Jerusalem.
Moreover Josiah put away the mediums and fortunetellers, the household images and idols, all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the Words of the Law which were written in the Book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Jehovah.
And before him there was no king like him, who turned to Jehovah with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him has any arisen like him.
Nevertheless Jehovah had not turned from His great burning wrath, with which His anger had been kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.
And Jehovah said, I will also remove Judah from before My face, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I had said, My name shall be there.
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went out to meet him. And Pharaoh Necho killed him at Megiddo when he saw him.
And his servants made him ride dead from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place.
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
And Pharaoh Necho put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
And Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Pharaoh took Jehoahaz and he came to Egypt, and he died there.
And Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give money at the mouth of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his assessment, to give it to Pharaoh Necho.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebudah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. Then he turned and rebelled against him.
And Jehovah sent against him raiding bands of Chaldeans, bands of Syrians, bands of Moabites, and bands of the sons of Ammon; He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the Word of Jehovah which He had spoken by the hand of His servants the prophets.
Surely at the mouth of Jehovah this came upon Judah, to remove them from before His face because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done,
and also because of the innocent blood that he had shed; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which Jehovah was not willing to forgive.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the kings of Judah.
So Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates.
Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his fathers had done.
At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, as his servants were besieging it.
And Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officials went out to the king of Babylon; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
And he carried out from there all the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house, and he cut in pieces all the articles of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah, as Jehovah had spoken.
He also carried into captivity all Jerusalem: all the commanders and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. No one remained except the poorest people of the land.
And he carried Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. The king’s mother, the king’s wives, his officials, and the mighty ones of prominence of the land he carried into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
All the men of valor, seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths, one thousand, all who were strong and fit for war, these the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his uncle, king in his place, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
He also did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
For through the anger of Jehovah it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He had cast them out from before His face, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
Thus it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his forces came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around.
And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
And the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were encamped all around against the city. And the king went the way toward the plain.
And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment upon him.
And they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
He burned the house of Jehovah and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of distinction, he burned with fire.
And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.
And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the rest of the people who remained in the city and the defectors who had fallen out to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude.
But the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.
The bronze pillars that were in the house of Jehovah, and the carts and the bronze sea that were in the house of Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried the bronze to Babylon.
They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils which were used in service.
The firepans and the basins, the things of gold in gold and of silver in silver, the captain of the guard carried away.
The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah, the bronze of all these articles was without weight.
The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital on it was of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network.
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
He also took out of the city an official who had charge of the men of war, five men who were found in the city who looked after the king’s presence, the chief marshal of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.
So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its land.
And he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left.
And when all the commanders of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
And Gedaliah swore before them and their men, and said to them, Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
But it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah, the Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah, so that they died.
And all the people, small and great, and the commanders of the forces, arose and went to Egypt; for they were afraid before the Chaldeans.
And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.
He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
And Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
And a continual allowance was rationed to him by the king, the matter day by day, all the days of his life.

these mentioned by name were chiefs in their families, and their father’s house increased abundantly.
And they went to the entrance of Gedor, as far as the east side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
And they found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, quiet, and peaceful; for those from Ham lived there formerly.
These recorded by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and they struck their tents and the Meunim who were found there, and utterly destroyed them, as it is to this day. So they dwelt in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks there.
Now some of them, five hundred men of the sons of Simeon, went to Mount Seir, with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi as their heads.
And they struck the remnant of the escaped Amalekites, and dwelt there to this day.
Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (he was indeed the firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, the son of Israel, for the genealogy to not be reckoned according to the birthright;

and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal Meon.
Eastward they settled as far as the entrance of the wilderness this side of the River Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead.
Now in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents before the east of Gilead.
And the children of Gad dwelt next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salcah:
Joel was the chief, Shapham the next, then Jaanai and Shaphat in Bashan,
and their brethren of their father’s house: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Eber; seven.
These were the sons of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz:

All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty valiant men, men able to bear shield and sword, shooting with the bow, and trained in war, going out to war.
They made war with the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were delivered into their hand, for they cried out unto God in the battle; and He was entreated for them, because they had trusted in Him.
And they took away their livestock; fifty thousand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys; and one hundred thousand souls of men;
for many fell down slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their place until the captivity.
Thus the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land. They multiplied from Bashan to Baal Hermon, Senir and Mount Hermon.
These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel; mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of their fathers’ houses.
And they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and went whoring after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria; and he carried the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into captivity. He brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the River Gozan to this day.

But Aaron and his sons were offering sacrifices with smoke upon the altar of burnt offering and upon the altar of incense, all the service of the Holy of Holies, to make atonement for Israel, according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded.

Meraioth his son, Amariah his son, Ahitub his son,

They gave them Hebron in the land of Judah, with its surrounding common lands.

Thus all Israel was reckoned by genealogies, and behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel. And Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.
Now the first inhabitants who dwelt in their possessions in their cities were Israelites, priests, Levites, and the temple slaves.
Some of the sons of Judah, the sons of Benjamin, and the sons of Ephraim and Manasseh dwelt in Jerusalem:

The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brethren; with Shallum as chief.
Until then they had been gatekeepers for the camps of the sons of Levi at the King’s Gate to the east.
Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, from his father’s house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, gatekeepers of the tent. Their fathers had been keepers at the entrance to the camp of Jehovah.
Phinehas the son of Eleazar had been the ruler over them previously; and Jehovah was with him.
Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the door of the tent of meeting.
All those chosen as gatekeepers were two hundred and twelve. They were reckoned by their genealogy, in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them in their faithfulness.
So they and their sons had charge of the gates of the house of Jehovah, the house of the tent, by watches.
The gatekeepers were at the four sides: the east, west, north, and south.
And their brethren in their villages had to come to them from time to time for seven days.
In this trust were four chief gatekeepers; Levites. And they had charge over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
They lodged all around the house of God because theirs was the charge for opening up morning by morning.
Some of them were over the vessels of service, for they brought them in by count and took them out by count.
Some of them were appointed over the furnishings and over all the implements of the sanctuary, and over the fine flour and the wine and the oil and the frankincense and the spices.
Some of the sons of the priests mixed the ointment of the spices.
Mattithiah of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the trust over the things that were made in the pans.
Some of their brethren of the sons of the Kohathites were to prepare the Bread in Rows Sabbath by Sabbath.
These were the singers, heads of fathers of the Levites, who stayed in the chambers, and were free from other duties; for this was their occupation day and night.
These heads of fathers of the Levites were heads throughout their generations; and dwelt in Jerusalem.
Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose wife’s name was Maacah, dwelt at Gibeon.

The son of Jonathan was Merib-Baal, and Merib-Baal begot Micah.

and Ahaz begot Jarah; Jarah begot Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begot Moza;
Moza begot Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel his son.
And Azel had six sons whose names were these: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these, the sons of Azel.
Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.
And the battle was heavy against Saul; and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
And Saul said to his armorbearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armorbearer would not, for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword and fell on it.
And when his armorbearer saw that Saul had died, he also fell on his sword and died.
Thus Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
And they stripped him and took his head and his weapons, and sent throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news to their idols and among the people.
And they put his weapons in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.
And when all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
all the valiant men arose and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons; and they brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
Thus Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had transgressed against Jehovah, because he had not kept the Word of Jehovah, and because he asked counsel to seek after a medium.
He had not inquired after Jehovah; therefore He killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
And all Israel gathered to David at Hebron, saying, Behold we are your bone and your flesh.
Also, in time past, even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and Jehovah your God said to you, You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over My people Israel.
Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before Jehovah. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Samuel.
And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come in here. Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion; the City of David.
And David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief commander. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief.
And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.
And he built the city all around, from the Millo and all around. And Joab restored the rest of the city.
And David went on, proceeding to greatness, for Jehovah of Hosts was with him.
These were the heads of the mighty men with David, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to the Word of Jehovah concerning Israel.
This is the number of David’s mighty men: Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the thirty; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed at one time.
After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was among the three mighty men.
He was with David at Pasdammim. Now the Philistines had gathered there for battle, and there was a parcel of land full of barley; and the people had fled before the Philistines.
But they took their stand in the middle of that field, recovered it, and killed the Philistines. And Jehovah saved by a great deliverance.
And three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
And David said longingly, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate.
So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it, but poured it out to Jehovah,
and said, Far be it from me, O my God, to do this. Shall I drink the blood of these men with their souls? For at the risk of their lives they have brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.
Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of another three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and had a name among the three.
Of the three he was more honored than the other two; therefore he became their commander. However he did not attain to the first three.
Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. He had killed two lion-like ones of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
And he killed an Egyptian, a man five cubits in stature. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear.
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among the three mighty men.
Behold, he was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David appointed him over his guard.
And the mighty ones of the army were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armorbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah),
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him),
Hanan the son of Maachah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,
Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
Now these were the ones who came to David at Ziklag while he was still restrained from before Saul the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helping in the war,
armed with bows, using both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows with the bow; Saul’s brethren from Benjamin.
The chief: Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite;
Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;
Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
Elkanah, Jisshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;
and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
Some Gadites had separated over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men of war fit for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
These were from the sons of Gad, chiefs of the army; the least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a thousand.
These are the ones who crossed over the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks; and they put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
And some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold.
And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see it and judge.
And when the Spirit had clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, he said: We are yours, O David; we are on your side, O son of Jesse. Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers. For your God helps you. So David received them, and assigned them to the chiefs among the troops.
Some from Manasseh had fallen out to David when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after taking counsel, saying, He may fall out to his master Saul with our heads.
When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who had fallen out to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai; heads of thousands from Manasseh.
And they helped David against the bands of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor, and they were commanders in the army;
for at that time they came to David day by day to help him, until it was a great camp, like the host of God.
These were the numbers of the divisions that were equipped for war, who had come to David at Hebron to turn over the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the mouth of Jehovah:
of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for war;
of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor fit for war, seven thousand one hundred;
of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred;
Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand seven hundred;
Zadok, a young man mighty in valor, and from his father’s house twenty-two commanders;
of the sons of Benjamin, kindred of Saul, three thousand (for until then the greater number of them were keeping the charge of guarding the house of Saul);
of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout the house of their fathers;
of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who had been designated by name to come and make David king;
of the sons of Issachar who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command;
of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who could go out to war and set the battle in array with all implements of war, to help with undivided heart;
of Naphtali one thousand commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear;
of the Danites who could draw up in battle formation, twenty-eight thousand six hundred;
of Asher, those who could go out to war and draw up in battle formation, forty thousand;
of the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from the other side of the Jordan, one hundred and twenty thousand armed for battle with every kind of implement of war.
All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a perfect heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them.
Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen; provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for there was joy in Israel.
And David consulted with the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.
And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you, and it is of Jehovah our God, let us send out and broadcast to our brethren everywhere who are left in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with them in their cities and their common lands, that they may gather together to us;
and let us bring around the ark of our God to us, for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.
And all the assembly responded to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim.
And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim of Judah, to bring up from there the ark of Jehovah God, who dwells between the cherubim, where His name has been proclaimed.
And they made the ark of God ride on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio were leading the cart.
And David and all Israel were making sport before God with all their might, with singing, with harps, with lutes, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.
And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen had fallen.
And the anger of Jehovah burned against Uzza, and He struck him because he had put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.
And David was furious because Jehovah had violently burst forth upon Uzza; therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day.
And David feared God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God to me?
So David did not take away the ark with him into the City of David, but turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timber, with masons and craftsmen, to build him a house.
Thus David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel, for his kingdom had been exalted on high for the sake of His people Israel.
And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David begot more sons and daughters.
And these are the names of his sons whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
Now when the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out to face them.
And the Philistines went and made a raid on the Valley of Rephaim.
And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Have You delivered them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, for I have delivered them into your hand.
So they went up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken through to my enemies by my hand like a breakthrough of water. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
And when they left their gods there, David commanded, and they were burned with fire.
The Philistines again made a raid on the valley.
And David again inquired of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; circle around them, and come upon them in front of the balsam trees.
And it shall be, when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.
So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon as far as Gezer.
And David’s fame went out into all the lands, for Jehovah had put the dread of him upon all the nations.
David built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.
Then David said, No one may carry the ark of God but the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to serve before Him continually.
And David gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place, which he had prepared for it.
And David assembled the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brethren;
of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brethren;
of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brethren;
of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his brethren;
of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of his brethren;
of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brethren.
And David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab;
and he said to them, You are the heads of the fathers of the Levites; consecrate yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.
For because you did not do it the first time, Jehovah our God has burst out against us, because we had not inquired of Him concerning the ordinance.
So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.
And the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as Moses had commanded according to the Word of Jehovah.
And David commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brethren as singers with instruments of song, lutes, harps, and resounding cymbals, to raise the voice with joy.
So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren the sons of Merari, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
and with them their brethren of the second rank. The gatekeepers: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel.
The singers: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, to sound the cymbals of bronze.
Lutes on Alamoth: Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah.
Directing with harps on the Sheminith: Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah.
The songs: Chenaniah, chief of the Levites; he taught the songs because he had understanding.
Doorkeepers for the ark: Berechiah and Elkanah.
Sounding the trumpets before the ark of God: Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests. Doorkeepers for the ark: Obed-Edom and Jehiah.
Thus David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-Edom with joy.
And so it was, as God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the leader in uplifting singing. David also wore a linen ephod.
Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the shofar, with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding aloud with lutes and harps.
And it happened, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the City of David, that Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.
And he distributed to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece of meat, and a cake of raisins.
And he appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Jehovah the God of Israel:
Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, Jeiel with lutes and harps, Asaph with resounding cymbals,
and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests continually with the trumpets before the ark of the covenant of God.
On that day David first gave this psalm by the hand of Asaph and his brethren, to give thanks unto Jehovah:
Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah. Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the peoples.
Sing unto Him, make music unto Him; talk of all His wondrous works.
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.
Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face continually.
Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,
O seed of Israel His servant, You children of Jacob, His elect.
He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
Remember His covenant forever, the word which He has commanded, for a thousand generations,
the covenant which He has made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac,
and established it to Jacob for a statute, to Israel for a perpetual covenant,
saying, To you I give the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance,
when you were few in number, even very few, and were sojourning in it.
When they went from nation to another, and from one kingdom to another people,
He permitted no man to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,
saying, Do not touch My anointed ones, and do My prophets no evil.
Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; proclaim His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is also to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are nothing, but Jehovah has made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place.
Ascribe unto Jehovah, O families of the peoples, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come before Him. Oh, bow down before Jehovah in the beauty of holiness.
Writhe before Him, all the earth. The world also is firmly established, it shall not be moved.
Let the Heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigns.
Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; let the fields rejoice, and all that is in them.
Then the trees of the forest shall cry out for joy before Jehovah, for He has come to judge the earth.
Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy is eternal.
And say, Save us, O God of our salvation; gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to boast in Your praise.
Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen; and praised Jehovah.
Thus he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter day by day;
and Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight brethren: Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun and Hosah, the gatekeepers;
and Zadok the priest and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah at the high place that was at Gibeon,
to offer burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the Law of Jehovah which He had commanded Israel;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were designated by name, to give thanks unto Jehovah, because His mercy is eternal;
and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals and the instruments of song of God; and the sons of Jeduthun were gatekeepers.
So all the people departed, every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
Now it came to pass, when David had been dwelling in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I am dwelling in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah is under curtains.
And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.
But it happened that night that the Word of God came to Nathan, saying,
Go and tell My servant David, Thus says Jehovah: You shall not build Me a house to dwell in.
For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
Wherever I have walked about with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I had commanded to shepherd My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?
Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I have taken you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel.
And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great ones of the earth.
Moreover I have established a place for My people Israel, and have planted them, that they may dwell in their place and move no more, for the sons of wickedness to wear them out anymore, as previously,
since the day that I have commanded judges to be over My people Israel. I have also subdued all your enemies. Furthermore I declare to you that Jehovah shall build you a house.
And it shall be, when your days have been fulfilled to go to your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you from your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.
I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
And I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.
According to all these words and according to all this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.
Then King David went in and sat before Jehovah, and he said: Who am I, O Jehovah God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the manner of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
What more can David add to You for the honor of Your servant? For You have known Your servant.
O Jehovah, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, to make known all this greatness.
O Jehovah, there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
And what single nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God has gone to redeem for Himself as a people; to make for Yourself a great name to be feared, to drive out nations before Your people whom You redeemed out of Egypt?
For You designated Your people Israel as Your people forever; and You, Jehovah, have become their God.
And now, O Jehovah, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, let it be established forever, and do as You have spoken.
Let it even be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, God to Israel. And let the house of Your servant David be established before You.
For You, O my God, have disclosed to Your servant’s ear that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found heart to pray before You.
And now, Jehovah, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant.
Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You have blessed it, O Jehovah, and it is blessed forever.
After this it came to pass that David struck the Philistines, subdued them, and took Gath and its daughter-villages from the hand of the Philistines.
Then he struck Moab, and the Moabites became David’s servants, bringing tribute.
And David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah as far as Hamath, as he went to establish his hand by the River Euphrates.
David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, except that he spared enough of them for one hundred chariots.
When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.
Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought tribute. Thus Jehovah prospered David wherever he went.
And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
Also from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the articles of bronze.
And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to ask after his welfare and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had been a man of war against Tou); along with all kinds of articles of gold, silver, and bronze.
King David also consecrated these unto Jehovah, along with the silver and gold that he had brought from all these nations: Edom, Moab, the children of Ammon, the Philistines, and Amalek.
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
He also put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And Jehovah prospered David wherever he went.
Thus David reigned over all Israel, executing judgment and justice to all his people.
Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were the priests; Shavsha was the scribe;
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chiefs at the king’s side.
It happened after this that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.
And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to Hanun in the land of the children of Ammon to comfort him.
And the leaders of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, In your eyes is David honoring your father in that he has sent comforters to you? Have not his servants come to you to search, to overthrow and to spy out the land?
Therefore Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, at their buttocks, and sent them away.
Then some went and reported to David about the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.
And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Syrian Naharaim, from Syrian Maachah, and from Zobah.
So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, with the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. Also the sons of Ammon gathered together from their cities, and came to battle.
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
And the sons of Ammon came out and put themselves in battle array before the entrance to the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.
And when Joab saw that the battle line was against him before and behind, he chose some of Israel’s choice ones and put them in battle array to meet the Syrians.
And the rest of the people he put into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in battle array against the sons of Ammon.
And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God; and may Jehovah do what is good in His eyes.
So Joab and the people who were with him drew near for the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they also fled before Abishai his brother, and entered the city. So Joab came to Jerusalem.
So when the Syrians saw that they had been struck down before Israel, they sent messengers and brought the Syrians who were beyond the River, and Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s army went before them.
And when it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed over the Jordan and came upon them, and set up in battle array against them. So when David had set up in battle array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers of the Syrians, and killed Shophach the commander of the army.
And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been struck down before Israel, they made peace with David and served him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
It happened at the time of the return of the year, at the time kings go out to battle, that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the land of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.
And David took their king’s crown from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoils of the city; a very great amount.
And he brought out the people who were in it, and cut them with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. Thus David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
And it happened afterward that war rose up at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was born to the giant. And they were subdued.
Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also had been born to the giant.
So when he reproached Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know it.
And Joab answered, May Jehovah make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord desire this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?
Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.
But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abhorrent to Joab.
And this thing caused the eye of God to quiver; therefore He struck Israel.
So David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.
And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,
Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Jehovah: I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.
So Gad came to David and said to him, Thus says Jehovah: Choose for yourself,
either three years of famine, or three months of being defeated before your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of Jehovah; the plague in the land, with the Angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now consider what word I shall return to the One sending me.
And David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.
So Jehovah sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.
And God sent the Angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying, Jehovah looked and was moved to compassion regarding the evil, and said to the Angel who was destroying, It is enough; now restrain Your hand. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
And David lifted his eyes and saw the Angel of Jehovah standing between earth and the heavens, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
And David said to God, Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O Jehovah my God, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people to be plagued.
And the Angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and set up an altar unto Jehovah on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah.
And Ornan turned and saw the Angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan had been threshing wheat.
And David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
And David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it unto Jehovah. You shall give it to me for the full price, that the plague may be restrained from the people.
And Ornan said to David, Take it to yourself, and let my lord the king do what is good in his eyes. See, I have also given you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I have given it all.
And King David said to Ornan, No, but I will buy to acquire it for the full price, for I will not take away what is yours for Jehovah, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.
And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and He answered him from the heavens by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.
And Jehovah commanded the Angel, and He returned His sword to its sheath.
At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
For the tabernacle of Jehovah and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, were at that time at the high place in Gibeon.
But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he had been terrified of the sword of the Angel of Jehovah.
Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
And David commanded to gather the sojourners in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to cut hewn stones to build the house of God.
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance beyond weight,
and cedar timber without number; for the Sidonians and those from Tyre brought cedar timber to David in abundance.
And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house to be built for Jehovah must be exceedingly magnificent, for fame and glory throughout all lands. I will now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparations before his death.
And he summoned his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.
And David said to Solomon: My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God;
but the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth before Me.
Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and tranquillity to Israel in his days.
He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.
Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of Jehovah your God, as He has spoken concerning you.
Only may Jehovah give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, to keep the Law of Jehovah your God.
Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments which Jehovah has commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed.
Now behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weight, for it is in abundance. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them.
Moreover there are workmen with you in abundance: hewers and craftsmen in stone and timber, and wise men for every kind of work.
There is no counting the gold and silver and bronze and iron. Arise and get to work; for Jehovah is with you.
David also commanded all the rulers of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
Is not Jehovah your God with you? And has He not given you rest all around? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before His people.
Now give your hearts and your souls to seek Jehovah your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the name of Jehovah.
So when David was old and satisfied with days, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
And he gathered together all the rulers of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and above; and the head count of the men was thirty-eight thousand.
Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah, six thousand officers and judges,
four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand for praising Jehovah with instruments, which I have made, said David, to give praise.
David also divided them into divisions among the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
The Gershonites: Laadan and Shimei.
The sons of Laadan: the first Jehiel, then Zetham and Joel; three.
The sons of Shimei: Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran; three. These were the heads of the fathers of Laadan.
And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; these, the four sons of Shimei.
Jahath was the first and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they were reckoned as one father’s house.
The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; four.
The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was set apart, he and his sons perpetually, that he should consecrate the set apart, holy things, to burn incense before Jehovah, to serve Him, and to bless in His name perpetually.
The sons of Moses the man of God were reckoned to the tribe of Levi.
The sons of Moses: Gershon and Eliezer.
The sons of Gershon: Shebuel was head.
The sons of Eliezer: Rehabiah was head. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was head.
The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
The sons of Uzziel: Michah was the first and Jesshiah the second.
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but only daughters; and their brethren, the sons of Kish, took them as wives.
The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth; three.
These were the sons of Levi by their fathers’ houses; heads of fathers as they were reckoned by the number of names by head count, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from the age of twenty years and above.
For David had said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to His people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem always;
and also to the Levites, They shall no longer need to carry the tabernacle, nor any of the vessels for its service.
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above;
because their function was to give a hand to the sons of Aaron in the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts and in the chambers, in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of God,
both with the Bread in Rows and the fine flour for the grain offering, with the unleavened cakes and what is in the pans, with what is mixed and with all kinds of measures and sizes;
to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at evening;
and to offer the burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the Sabbaths and on the new moons and on the set feasts, by number according to their ordinance, continually before Jehovah;
and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren in the service of the house of Jehovah.
These are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
And Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no sons; and Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to the office of their service.
There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus they were divided. Among the sons of Eleazar were sixteen chief men of their fathers’ houses, and eight heads of their fathers’ houses among the sons of Ithamar.
Thus they were divided by lot, these and these; for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of the house of God, from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar.
And the scribe, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, one of the Levites, wrote them down before the king, the rulers, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers of the priests and Levites, one father’s house taken for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.
The first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Pizzez,
the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,
the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
This was the assignment of their service to come into the house of Jehovah according to their ordinance by the hand of Aaron their father, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.
And for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
For Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.
Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
Of the sons of Hebron, Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
Of the sons of Uzziel, Michah; of the sons of Michah, Shamir.
The brother of Michah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
The sons of Merari by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel.
The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers’ houses.
These also cast lots, as their brothers the sons of Aaron did, in the presence of King David: Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and Levites, and the chief fathers, as well as their younger brethren.
Moreover David and the commanders of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, for prophesying with harps, lutes, and cymbals. And the number of the skilled men performing their service,
of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the hand of the king.
Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah; six; under the hand of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with the harp to give thanks and to praise Jehovah.
Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the Words of God, to exalt his horn; for God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, lutes, and harps, for the service of the house of God, under the hand of the king: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.
So the number of them, with their brethren who were trained in the songs of Jehovah, all with understanding: two hundred and eighty-eight.
And they cast lots for their duties, small and great, teacher and scholar.
The first lot for Asaph came out for Joseph. The second for Gedaliah, him with his brethren and sons; twelve.
The third for Zaccur, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The fourth for Jizri, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The fifth for Nethaniah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The sixth for Bukkiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The seventh for Jesharelah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The eighth for Jeshaiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The ninth for Mattaniah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The eleventh for Azarel, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twelfth for Hashabiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The thirteenth for Shubael, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The fourteenth for Mattithiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The fifteenth for Jeremoth, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The sixteenth for Hananiah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The seventeenth for Joshbekashah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The eighteenth for Hanani, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The nineteenth for Mallothi, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twentieth for Eliathah, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twenty-first for Hothir, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twenty-second for Giddalti, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twenty-third for Mahazioth, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The twenty-fourth for Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brethren; twelve.
The divisions of the gatekeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.
The sons of Meshelemiah: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh.
The sons of Obed-Edom: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth,
Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth; for God blessed him.
Also sons were born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled their fathers’ houses, for they were mighty men of valor.
The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; whose brothers Elihu and Semachiah were men of valor.
All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom, they and their sons and their brethren, mighty men of valor for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom.
And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, eighteen men of valor.
Also Hosah, of the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri the first (for though he was not the firstborn, his father made him the first),
Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth; all the sons and brethren of Hosah, thirteen.
Among these were the divisions of the gatekeepers, among the chief men, having duties just like their brethren, to serve in the house of Jehovah.
And they cast lots for each gate, the small and the great, according to their father’s house.
The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. And they cast lots for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and his lot came out for the north.
To Obed-Edom the south, and to his sons the storehouse.
To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came out for the west, for the Shallecheth Gate ascending to the highway; guard next to guard.
On the east were six Levites, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, and for the storehouse two and two.
As for the Parbar on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the Parbar.
These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the sons of Korah and among the sons of Merari.
Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God and over the treasuries of the dedicated things.
The sons of Laadan, the sons of the Gershonites of Laadan, heads of their fathers, of Laadan the Gershonite: Jehieli.
The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel his brother were over the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.
Of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasuries.
His brethren by Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
This Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things which King David and the heads of fathers, the commanders over thousands and hundreds, and the commanders of the army, had consecrated.
Some of the spoils won in battles they consecrated to maintain the house of Jehovah.
And all that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had consecrated, every dedicated thing, was under the hand of Shelomith and his brethren.
Of the Izharites: Chenaniah and his sons were over the external business over Israel of the officials and judges.
Of the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his brethren, one thousand seven hundred able men, had the oversight of Israel on the west side of the Jordan for all the business of Jehovah, and in the service of the king.
Of the Hebronites: Jerijah was head of the Hebronites according to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead.
And his brethren were two thousand seven hundred men of valor, heads of fathers, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God and the matters of the king.
And the sons of Israel, according to their number, the heads of fathers, the commanders of thousands and hundreds and their officers, served the king in every matter in their divisions. These divisions came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year; each division having twenty-four thousand.
Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel, and in his division were twenty-four thousand;
he was of the sons of Perez, and chief of all the commanders of the army for the first month.
Over the division of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his division Mikloth also was the ruler; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The third commander of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
This was the Benaiah who was mighty among the thirty, and was over the thirty; in his division was Ammizabad his son.
The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The fifth commander for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The sixth for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The seventh for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the sons of Ephraim; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbechai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The ninth for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the Benjamites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The eleventh for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the sons of Ephraim; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
The twelfth for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel; in his division were twenty-four thousand.
Furthermore, over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri; of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maachah;
of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of the Aaronites, Zadok;
of Judah, Elihu, one of David’s brothers; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael;
of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel;
of the sons of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah;
of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner;
of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the rulers over the tribes of Israel.
But David did not take the number of those twenty years old and under, because Jehovah had said He would multiply Israel like the stars of the heavens.
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to count, but he did not finish, for wrath came upon Israel because of this; nor was the number recorded in the account of the chronicles of King David.
Azmaveth the son of Adiel was over the king’s treasuries; and Jehonathan the son of Uzziah was over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers.
Ezri the son of Chelub was over those who did the work of the field for working the land.
And Shimei the Ramathite was over the vineyards, and Zabdi the Shiphmite was over the produce of the vineyards for the supply of wine.
Baal-Hanan the Gederite was over the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the lowlands, and Joash was over the supply of oil.
And Shitrai the Sharonite was over the herds that fed in Sharon, and Shaphat the son of Adlai was over the herds in the valleys.
Obil the Ishmaelite was over the camels, Jehdeiah the Meronothite was over the donkeys,
and Jaziz the Hagrite was over the flocks. All these were the officials over King David’s property.
Also Jehonathan, David’s uncle, was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons.
Ahithophel was the king’s counselor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend.
After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, then Abiathar. And the commander of the king’s army was Joab.
Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the rulers of Israel: the chiefs of the tribes and the leaders of the divisions who served the king, the commanders over thousands and commanders over hundreds, and the officials over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the overseers, the mighty men, and all the men of valor.
And King David rose to his feet and said, Hear me, my brethren and my people: I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and for the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it.
But God has said to me, You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood.
However Jehovah the God of Israel chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen Judah as the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father, and among the sons of my father, He has been pleased to make me king over all Israel.
And of all my sons (for Jehovah has given me many sons) He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of Jehovah, over Israel.
And He said to me, Your son Solomon shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father.
Moreover I will establish his kingdom forever, if he prevails to do My commandments and My judgments, as it is this day.
Now therefore, in the eyes of all Israel the assembly of Jehovah, and in the ears of our God, take heed to seek out all the commandments of Jehovah your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you always.
As for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Jehovah searches all hearts and understands all the intent of the thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will cast you off forever.
Consider now, for Jehovah has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong, and do it.
Then David gave his son Solomon the pattern for the porch, its houses, its treasuries, its upper chambers, its inner chambers, and the place of the mercy seat;
and the pattern for all that he had by the Spirit, of the courts of the house of Jehovah, of all the chambers all around, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries for the consecrated things;
also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of service in the house of Jehovah.
Gold by weight for the things of gold, for all the vessels used in every kind of service; also silver for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels used in every kind of service;
the weight for the lampstands of gold, and their lamps of gold, by weight for each lampstand and its lamps; for the lampstands of silver by weight, for the lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand.
And by weight, the gold for the tables of the Bread in Rows, for each table, and silver for the tables of silver;
also pure gold for the forks, the bowls, the pitchers of pure gold, and the golden basins; gold by weight for every basin; and for the silver basins, silver by weight for every basin;
and refined gold by weight for the altar of incense, and for the construction of the chariot, that is, the gold cherubim that spread their wings and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of Jehovah.
All this, said David, Jehovah has given me insight in writing, by His hand upon me, all these patterns of the workmanship.
And David said to his son Solomon, Be strong and of good courage, and do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, will be with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have finished all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah.
Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and every willing man of wisdom will be with you for all manner of workmanship, for every kind of service; also the rulers and all the people are here for whatever you say.
Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender; and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for Jehovah God.
Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for things to be made of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, wood for things of wood, onyx stones, stones to be set, antimony and of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and alabaster stones in abundance.
Moreover, because of my determination regarding the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary, from my own possessions of gold and silver:
three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be done by the hands of craftsmen. Who then is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto Jehovah?
Then the heads of the fathers, chiefs of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with the officers over the king’s business, offered free-will offerings.
They gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
And those with whom precious stones were found, gave them to the treasury of the house of Jehovah, into the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
And the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they had offered willingly unto Jehovah; and King David also rejoiced with great joy.
And David blessed Jehovah before the eyes of all the assembly, and David said: Blessed are You, Jehovah the God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.
Yours, O Jehovah, is the greatness, the power and the glory, the victory and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and on earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and You are exalted as head over all.
Both riches and honor come from before You, and You reign over all. In Your hand is power and might; it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.
Now therefore, our God, we are giving thanks to You and praising Your glorious name.
But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things are from You, and out of Your own hand we have given to You.
For we are strangers and sojourners before You, as were all our fathers; our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is no hope.
O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is out of Your hand, and is all Your own.
I know also, my God, that You examine the heart and take pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now with joy I have seen Your people who are found here, to offer willingly to You.
O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You.
And give my son Solomon a perfect heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all these things, and to build the temple for which I have made provision.
And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. So all the assembly blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers, and bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah and the king.
And they slaughtered sacrifices unto Jehovah and offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
And they ate and drank before Jehovah with great gladness that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Jehovah as the prince, and Zadok as priest.
And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
All the rulers and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, set themselves under the hand of King Solomon.
Thus Jehovah highly magnified Solomon in the eyes of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
Thus David the son of Jesse had reigned over all Israel.
And the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years he reigned in Jerusalem.
And he died in a good old age, satisfied with days, riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.
Now the acts of King David, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer;
of all his reign and his might, and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.
And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and highly magnified him.
And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers;
and Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness, was there.
But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to the place David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
And the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and the assembly sought it out.
And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
That night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give you.
And Solomon said to God: You have shown great mercy to David my father, and have made me king in his place.
Now, O Jehovah God, let Your promise to David my father be established, for You have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth for multitude.
Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?
And God said to Solomon: Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king;
wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings who were before you have had, nor shall any after you have the like.
So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, and reigned over Israel.
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.
Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.
And Solomon had horses exported out of Egypt and Mikveh; the king’s merchants got them at Mikveh for a price.
Now a chariot that came up and was brought out from Egypt was six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; and thus, by their hand, they brought them out to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a royal house for himself.
Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre, saying: As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in,
behold, I am building a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to consecrate it to Him, to burn before Him spiced incense, for the continual Bread in Rows, for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God, continually in Israel;
and the house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods;
but who is able to build Him a house, since the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who am I then, that I should build Him a house, except to burn sacrifices with smoke before Him?
Therefore now, send me a skilled man to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and violet, who has skill to engrave carvings with the wise men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father has provided.
Also send me cedar, cypress and algum from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold my servants will be with your servants,
to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house which I am building shall be great and wonderful.
And behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who are cutting timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
And Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon: Because of Jehovah’s love for His people, He has appointed you king over them.
Huram also said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has made the heavens and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Jehovah and a royal house for himself.
And now I have sent a skillful man, having knowledge and understanding, Huram-abi,
(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father, a man of Tyre), knowing how to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and violet, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your craftsmen and with the craftsmen of my lord David your father.
Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants.
And we will cut timber from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.
And Solomon numbered all the foreign men who were in the land of Israel, after the census in which David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.
And he made seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.
Thus Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where He had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
And he began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
This is the foundation which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length was sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits.
And the porch that was in front of the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height was one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
The great house he paneled with cypress which he covered with fine gold, and he put palm trees and chains on it.
And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold from Parvaim.
He also covered the house, the beams and thresholds, its walls and doors, with gold; and he engraved cherubim on the walls.
And he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length was the same as the front of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He covered it with six hundred talents of fine gold.
The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold; and he covered the upper chambers with gold.
In the house of the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of sculpted work, and overlaid them with gold.
The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits in length: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub;
one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing also was five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub.
The wings of these cherubim stretching out twenty cubits; standing on their feet, facing the house.
And he made the veil of violet, purple, crimson, and fine linen, with raised cherubim.
He also made in front of the house two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
He made chains, as in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.
Moreover he made a bronze altar: twenty cubits was its length, twenty cubits its width, and ten cubits its height.
And he made the cast sea, ten cubits from brim to brim, a round circle. Its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits circled around it.
And underneath it were shapes like oxen encircling it all around, ten per cubit, all the way around the Sea. The oxen were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
It stood on twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the sea was set upon them, with all their back parts inward.
It was a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold three thousand baths.
He also made ten basins, and put five on the right side and five on the left, to wash in them; such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.
And he made ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance, and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left.
He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made one hundred bowls of gold.
Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court and doors for the court; and he overlaid these doors with bronze.
He set the sea on the right side, toward the southeast.
And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. And Huram finished doing the work that he was to do for King Solomon for the house of God:
the two pillars and the bowls and capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks covering the two bowls of the capitals which were on the tops of the pillars;
four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars);
he also made the carts and the basins on the carts;
one sea and twelve oxen under it;
also the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the utensils Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of Jehovah.
In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.
And Solomon had all these vessels made in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.
Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of God: the altar of gold and the tables on which was the Bread of the Presence,
the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn according to the ordinance in front of the inner sanctuary,
with the flowers and the lamps and the snuffers of gold, of purest gold;
the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the censers of pure gold. And the entrance of the house, its inner doors to the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, were gold.
Thus all the work that Solomon had done for the house of Jehovah was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had consecrated: the silver and the gold and all the articles. And he put them in the treasuries of the house of God.
And Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah up from the City of David, which is Zion.
And all the men of Israel assembled to the king for the feast, which was in the seventh month.
And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests, the Levites, brought them up.
Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude.
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.
For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered over the ark and its poles from above.
And the poles were long enough that the ends of the poles of the ark could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day.
Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses had put there at Horeb, when Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
And it came to pass when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves, without observing their divisions),
and the Levites who were singing, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, were standing to the east of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, lutes and harps, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding the trumpets;
and those sounding the trumpets and those singing were as one, with one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah, to raise their voices with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of song, to praise Jehovah, saying: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal; that the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud,
so that the priests could not remain standing to serve before the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God.
Then Solomon spoke: Jehovah has said He would dwell in the dark cloud.
I have built You an exalted house, and a place for You to dwell always.
And the king turned his face and blessed the whole assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.
And he said: Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands what He has spoken with His mouth to my father David, saying,
Since the day that I brought My people out of the land of Egypt, I have chosen no city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house, that My name might be there, nor have I chosen any man to be a ruler over My people Israel.
Yet I have chosen Jerusalem, that My name may be there; and I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.
Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
But Jehovah said to my father David, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for My name, you did well in that it was in your heart.
Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will come from your loins, he shall build the house for My name.
Thus Jehovah has fulfilled His word which He has spoken, and I have risen up in place of my father David, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah has spoken; and I have built the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.
And there I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of Jehovah which He has made with the children of Israel.
And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands
(for Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and he stood on it, knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward Heaven),
and he said: O Jehovah, God of Israel, there is no God in the heavens or on earth like You, keeping Your covenant and mercy with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.
You have kept what You have spoken to Your servant David my father; You have both spoken with Your mouth and fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.
Therefore, O Jehovah, God of Israel, now keep what You have spoken to Your servant David my father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man sitting before Me on the throne of Israel, only if your sons take heed to their way, to walk in My Law as you have walked before Me.
And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, let Your Word be established, which You have spoken to Your servant David.
But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You. How much less this house which I have built.
Yet have regard to the prayer of Your servant and his supplication, O Jehovah my God, and listen to the cry and the prayer which Your servant is praying before You:
that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, toward the place where You have spoken to put Your name, that You may hear the prayer which Your servant prays toward this place.
And may You hear the supplications of Your servant and of Your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and when You have heard, forgive.
If anyone sins against his neighbor, and has been required to swear an oath, and has come with an oath before Your altar in this house,
then hear from Heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, to bring retribution on the wicked to bring his way upon his own head, and to justify the righteous to give him according to his righteousness.
Or if Your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and have returned and confessed Your name, and prayed and made supplication before You in this house,
then hear from Heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You have given to them and their fathers.
When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against You, when they have prayed toward this place and confessed Your name, and turned from their sin because You afflicted them,
then hear in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on Your land which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.
When there is famine in the land, pestilence or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers; when their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever the plague or whatever the sickness;
whatever prayer or supplication is made by anyone, or by all Your people Israel, when each one knows his own plague and his own grief, and has spread out his hands to this house:
then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to everyone according to all his ways, whose heart You know (for You alone have known the hearts of the sons of men),
that they may fear You, to walk in Your ways all the days they live on the face of the land which You have given to our fathers.
Moreover, concerning a foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel, but who has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and Your outstretched arm, when they have come and prayed in this house;
then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You, that all peoples of the earth may know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.
When Your people go out to battle against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they have prayed to You toward this city which You have chosen and the house which I have built for Your name,
then hear from Heaven their prayer and their supplication, and do what is fitting.
When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin), and You have become angry with them and delivered them to the enemy, and they have taken them captive to a land far or near;
yet when they have returned in their hearts in the land where they have been carried captive, and have turned back, and sought Your favor in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have acted wickedly;
and when they have returned to You with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captive, and prayed toward their land which You have given to their fathers, the city which You have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for Your name:
then hear from Heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their supplications, and bring about justice, and forgive Your people who have sinned against You.
Now, my God, I pray, let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
Now therefore, Arise, O Jehovah God, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. Let Your priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let Your saints rejoice in goodness.
O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed; remember the faithfulness of Your servant David.
And when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
And the priests were not able to enter the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah.
When all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah upon the house, they bowed their faces to the ground on the pavement, and prostrated themselves and gave thanks unto Jehovah, saying: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal.
And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah.
King Solomon offered sacrifices of twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
The priests were stationed at their posts; the Levites also with instruments of song unto Jehovah, (which King David had made to give praise unto Jehovah, saying, For His mercy is eternal, whenever David offered praise by their hand), and the priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel were standing.
Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.
At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.
And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that Jehovah had done to David, to Solomon, and to His people Israel.
Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah and the king’s house; and Solomon brought to successful conclusion all that came into his heart to make in the house of Jehovah and in his own house.
And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.
When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people,
if My people who have been called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from the heavens, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.
Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayers of this place.
For now I have chosen and consecrated this house, that My name may be there always; and My eyes and My heart shall be there all the days.
As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David has walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My judgments,
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man ruling in Israel.
But if you turn back and have forsaken My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them,
then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out from before My face, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
And as for this lofty house, everyone who passes by it will be appalled and say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and this house?
Then they will answer, Because they have forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and taken hold on other gods, and bowed down to them and served them; therefore He has brought all this evil upon them.
It came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Jehovah and his own house,
that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them; and he caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
And Solomon went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.
He also built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities which he built in Hamath.
He built upper Beth Horon and lower Beth Horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars;
also Baalath and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
All the people who were left of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of Israel;
that is, their sons who were left in the land after them, whom the sons of Israel had not finished off; from these Solomon raised forced labor, as it is to this day.
But Solomon did not make slaves for his work from the sons of Israel. They were men of war, commanders of his officers, commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen.
And others were chiefs of the deputies of King Solomon: two hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people.
And Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the house he had built for her; for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, because the places to which the ark of Jehovah has come are holy.
And Solomon offered burnt offerings unto Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah which he had built before the porch,
according to the matter of each day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three appointed yearly feasts; the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths.
And, according to the ordinance of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, the Levites for their charges, to praise and serve before the priests, as the charge of each day required, and the gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate; for thus was the commandment of David the man of God.
They did not depart from the command of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
And all the work of Solomon was steadfast from the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah until it was finished. Thus the house of Jehovah was completed.
Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the seacoast, in the land of Edom.
And Huram sent him ships by the hand of his servants, and servants who knew the sea. They went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and carried away four hundred and fifty talents of gold from there, and brought it to King Solomon.
Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem to test Solomon with difficult questions, having a very great retinue, camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.
And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from Solomon, that he could not explain it to her.
And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built,
the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers and their apparel, and his chamber by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, it took her breath away.
And she said to the king: The word was true which I have heard in my own land, about your words and your wisdom.
However I did not believe their words until I had come and my eyes saw it; and behold, the half of the greatness of your wisdom was not told me. You exceed the reports which I have heard.
Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom.
Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for Jehovah your God. In your God’s love for Israel, to establish them forever, He has made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.
And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there had never been any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
Also, the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.
And the king made terraces of the algum wood for the house of Jehovah and for the king’s house, also harps and lutes for the singers; and there had never before been seen such as these in the land of Judah.
And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.
The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.
He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the house of the Forest of Lebanon.
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests.
Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.
All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, the matter year by year.
Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.
And he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.
And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
And Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.
And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
And it happened, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it, where he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
And they sent for him and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he has put on us, and we will serve you.
So he said to them, Come back to me after three days. And the people departed.
And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, How do you advise me to answer these people?
And they spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to the people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.
But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.
And he said to them, What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father had put on us?
And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins!
And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!
So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.
And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders,
and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!
So the king did not consent to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that Jehovah might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
And when all Israel saw that the king did not consent to them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David! And all Israel departed to their tents.
But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah.
And King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the labor force; but the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. So King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.
Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
Now when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he summoned up from the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand choice men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
But the Word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
Thus says Jehovah: You shall not go up or fight against your brethren. Let every man return to his house, for this thing has come about from Me. And they obeyed the words of Jehovah, and turned back from going against Jeroboam.
So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
And he built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
Beth Zur, Sochoh, Adullam,
Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, fortified cities.
And he fortified the strongholds, and put commanders in them, and stores of food, oil, and wine.
Also in every city he put shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him.
For the Levites left their common lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests unto Jehovah.
And he appointed for himself priests for the high places, for the satyrs, and the calves which he had made.
And those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and spent three years making Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, because they walked in the ways of David and Solomon for three years.
And Rehoboam took for himself as wife Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliah the son of Jesse.
And she bore him sons: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham.
After her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
And Rehoboam loved Maachah the granddaughter of Absalom more than all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maachah as head, as prince among his brothers; to make him king.
He dealt with discernment, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the territories of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. He also sought many wives for them.
Now it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that he and all Israel with him forsook the Law of Jehovah.
And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against Jehovah,
with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians.
And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.
Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the rulers of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Jehovah: You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have forsaken you to the hand of Shishak.
So the rulers of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, Jehovah is righteous.
And when Jehovah saw that they had humbled themselves, the Word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them a little deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may distinguish between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the earth.
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made.
Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the commanders of the runners, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house.
And whenever the king entered the house of Jehovah, the runners went and brought them out; then they returned them to the guardroom.
When he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned back from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also, conditions were good in Judah.
Thus Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.
And he did evil, because he had not fixed his heart to seek Jehovah.
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies. And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his place.
In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah.
He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
Abijah began the battle with an army of mighty men of war, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.
And Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:
Should you not know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, by a covenant of salt?
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.
And worthless men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.
And now you think to prevail before the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David; and you are a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam made for you as gods.
Have you not cast out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of other lands, so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of things that are not gods?
But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their service.
And they burn with smoke unto Jehovah every morning and every evening, the burnt sacrifices and spiced incense; they also set the Bread in Rows in order on the pure gold table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps to burn every evening; for we are keeping the command of Jehovah our God, but you have forsaken Him.
Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against Jehovah the God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper.
But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
And when Judah looked around, behold the battle was before and behind them; and they cried out unto Jehovah, and the priests were sounding the trumpets.
And the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.
And Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; and five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain.
Thus the sons of Israel were subdued at that time; and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they had trusted on Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its daughter-villages, Jeshanah with its daughter-villages, and Ephron with its daughter-villages.
And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and Jehovah struck him, and he died.
But Abijah became mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the midrash of the prophet Iddo.
So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.
Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God,
for he removed the foreign altars and the high places, and broke down the sacred pillars and chopped down the groves.
He commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the Law and the commandment.
He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet before him.
And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.
Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities and make walls around them, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought Him, and He has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.
And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.
Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.
And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
And Asa cried out unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it is nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no strength; help us, O Jehovah our God, for we have trusted on You, and in Your name we go against this multitude. O Jehovah, You are our God; do not let man prevail against You.
So Jehovah struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.
And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So the Ethiopians fell, and they could not recover, for they were broken before Jehovah and His army. And they carried away very much spoils.
And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Jehovah had come upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoils in them.
They also struck the tents of the livestock, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded.
And he went out before Asa, and said to him: Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you while you are with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.
For many days Israel has been without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without Law;
but when in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them.
And in those times there was no peace to the one going out, nor to the one coming in, but great turmoil was on all the inhabitants of the lands.
And nation has been destroyed by nation, and city by city; for God has vexed them with every distress.
But you, be strong and do not let your hands relax, for there is reward for your work.
And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of Jehovah that was before the porch of Jehovah.
And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those sojourning with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they had fallen out to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.
And they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
And they offered to Jehovah at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoils they had brought.
And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
and whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel was put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
And they swore unto Jehovah with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and shofars.
And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought Him with all their will; and He was found by them, and Jehovah gave them rest all around.
He also removed Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen mother, because she had made a horrible thing for the grove; and Asa cut down her horrible thing, and crushed and burned it by the Brook Kidron.
But the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had consecrated and that he himself had consecrated: silver and gold and vessels.
And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.
In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
And Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of Jehovah and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
Let there be a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.
So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.
And it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.
And King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.
At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: Because you have leaned on the king of Syria, and have not trusted on Jehovah your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.
Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you trusted on Jehovah, He delivered them into your hand.
For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong for those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on there will be wars for you.
Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison house, for he was enraged at him for this; and Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.
And so, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his sickness was severe; yet in his sickness he did not seek Jehovah, but the physicians.
So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.
And they buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments; and they made a very great burning for him.
Then Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel.
And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which Asa his father had taken.
And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals,
but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to the deeds of Israel.
Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah gave tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance.
And his heart was exalted in the ways of Jehovah; moreover he removed the high places and groves out of Judah.
Also in the third year of his reign he sent his rulers, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
And with them he sent Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
So they taught in Judah, and had the Book of the Law of Jehovah with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.
And the fear of Jehovah was on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute of silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
So Jehoshaphat went on to become highly magnified, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.
He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.
These are their numbers, according to their fathers’ houses. Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;
and next to him was Jehohanan the commander, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;
and next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto Jehovah, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield;
and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war.
These served the king, besides those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and allied himself with Ahab and became his son-in-law.
At the end of some years he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people with him, and enticed him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead.
So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead? And he answered him, I am as you are, and my people as your people; also with you in the war.
And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Please inquire for the Word of Jehovah today.
So the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not still a prophet of Jehovah here, that we may inquire of Him?
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom to inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
So the king of Israel summoned one of his officers and said, Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.
The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in their robes, were sitting each on his throne; and they were sitting at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made horns of iron for himself; and he said, Thus says Jehovah: With these you shall thrust at the Syrians to finish them off.
And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for Jehovah has delivered it into the king’s hand.
And the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Therefore please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak of good things.
And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, whatever my God says, that I will speak.
And he came to the king; and the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain? And he said, Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!
And the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?
Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
Then Micaiah said, Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah: I have seen Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens standing on His right hand and His left.
And Jehovah said, Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead? So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner.
Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will persuade him. Jehovah said to him, In what way?
So he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, You shall seduce him and also succeed; go out and do so.
Therefore behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and Jehovah has spoken evil against you.
Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way has the spirit from Jehovah gone from me to speak to you?
And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide.
And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son;
and say, Thus says the king: Put this one in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.
And Micaiah said, If indeed you do return in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Pay attention, all you people!
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
Now the king of Syria had commanded the commanders of the chariots who were with him, saying, Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.
So it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel! Therefore they surrounded him to engage in battle; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him, and God drew them away from him.
For so it was, when the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn your hand and bring me out of the battle, for I am wounded.
The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot in view of the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died.
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned in peace to his house in Jerusalem.
And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out before him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, Should you help the wicked and love those hating Jehovah? Therefore wrath is upon you from before Jehovah.
Nevertheless good things have been found in you, in that you have burned the groves from the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.
So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And he appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
and said to the judges, Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, who is with you in the words of judgment.
Now therefore, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it, for there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.
Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of Jehovah and for disputes, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the chief fathers of Israel of the Levites and priests, who were brought back to Jerusalem.
And he commanded them, saying, You shall do this in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness and with a perfect heart:
Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against Law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not trespass against Jehovah and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you shall not be guilty.
And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you. Deal firmly, and Jehovah will be with the good.
And it happened after this that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon, along with others besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat.
And some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying, A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar (which is En Gedi).
And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek Jehovah, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
So Judah gathered together to seek the face of Jehovah; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the face of Jehovah.
And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of Jehovah, before the new court,
and said: O Jehovah the God of our fathers, are You not God in Heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You?
Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham Your friend forever?
And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,
If evil comes upon us; sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine; we will stand before this house and before Your face (for Your name is in this house), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.
And now, behold, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them and have not destroyed them.
Behold, they are rewarding us by coming to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit.
O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.
Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, were standing before Jehovah.
Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.
And he said, Give attention, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, O King Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you: Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s.
Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Jeruel.
You shall not fight in this battle. Station yourselves, stand your ground and see the salvation of Jehovah for you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out before them, for Jehovah is with you.
And Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to prostrate themselves before Jehovah.
And the Levites of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites stood up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with loud voices on high.
So they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Trust in Jehovah your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.
And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing unto Jehovah, and who should praise the glory of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: Give thanks unto Jehovah, for His mercy is eternal.
And when they began to cry out in songs of praise, Jehovah set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were smitten.
For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
So when Judah had come to the lookout point at the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, the corpses, fallen to the earth. No one had escaped.
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoils, they found among them an abundance of property on the corpses, with precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days plundering the spoils because there was so much.
And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah to this day.
Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at the head of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.
So they came to Jerusalem, with lutes and harps and trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.
And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.
So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.
So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah.
Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not fixed their hearts to the God of their fathers.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is brought up in the book of the kings of Israel.
After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah had made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly.
And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.
But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken your works. And the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his place.
He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
Their father gave them many gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
Now when Jehoram rose to power over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also others of the rulers of Israel.
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
Yet Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever.
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
So Jehoram went out with his commanders, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.
Thus Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. At that time Libnah revolted from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers.
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and thrust Judah aside.
And a writing came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of your father David: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot like the harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have killed your brothers, those of your father’s household, who were better than yourself,
behold, Jehovah is striking your people with a great blow; your children, your wives, and all your possessions;
and you shall have great sickness with a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.
Moreover Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabians who were near the Ethiopians.
And they came up into Judah and broke through, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
And after all this Jehovah struck him in his intestines with an incurable disease.
And it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died from the miserable disease. And his people made no burning for him, like the burnings for his fathers.
He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, and departed unloved. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the Arabians into the camp had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned.
Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was counseling him to do wickedly.
Therefore he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.
He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians struck Joram.
And he returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds with which he was struck at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
Now Ahaziah’s destruction, when he went to Joram, was from God; for when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
And it happened, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them.
He also sought for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, because, they said, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no one to retain power over the kingdom.
Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and commanded to destroy all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being killed, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him.
And he was hiding with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
In the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and made a covenant with the commanders of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri.
And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken of the sons of David.
This is what you shall do: One-third of you entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the doors;
one-third shall be at the king’s house; and one-third at the gate of the foundation. All the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah.
But let no one come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they are holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah.
And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.
So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were going out on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the divisions.
And Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and the large and small shields which had belonged to King David, that were in the house of God.
And he stationed all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and by the house, all around the king.
And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the Testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, Long live the king!
Now when Athaliah heard the sound of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.
When she looked, behold, the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the rulers and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were joyful, blowing trumpets, and singing with instruments of song, and leading in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, Treason! Treason!
And Jehoiada the priest brought out the commanders of hundreds who mustered the forces, and said to them, Bring her out of the area of the house, and slay with the sword whoever follows her. For the priest had said, Do not kill her in the house of Jehovah.
So they laid hands on her, and she came by way of the entrance of the Horse Gate by the king’s house, and they killed her there.
And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the people, and the king, to be the people of Jehovah.
And all the people went to the house of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
Jehoiada also appointed the oversight of the house of Jehovah into the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had assigned to the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with gladness and song, by the hands of David.
And he stationed the gatekeepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah, so that no one who was in any way unclean could enter.
And he took the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of Jehovah; and they came through the Upper Gate to the king’s house, and made the king sit on the throne of the kingdom.
So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
Joash did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.
Now it happened after this that Joash set his heart to repair the house of Jehovah.
And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly. However the Levites did not do it quickly.
So the king called Jehoiada the chief priest, and said to him, Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the offering of Moses the servant of Jehovah and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of witness?
For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also offered all the consecrated things of the house of Jehovah to the Baals.
So at the king’s command they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of Jehovah.
And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to Jehovah the offering that Moses the servant of God had laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, brought and threw into the chest until they were all finished.
So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, that the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah; and they hired masons and craftsmen to repair the house of Jehovah, and also craftsmen in iron and bronze to restore the house of Jehovah.
So the workmen labored, and the work of restoration excelled in their hands; they built up the house of God to its proper measure and strengthened it.
When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; they made from it vessels for the house of Jehovah, utensils for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.
And Jehoiada grew old and satisfied with days, and died; he was one hundred and thirty years old at his death.
And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.
And after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king gave heed to them.
And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers, and served the groves and idols; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass.
And He sent prophets to them, to bring them back to Jehovah; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.
And the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus says God: Why do you transgress the commandments of Jehovah, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have forsaken Jehovah, He also has forsaken you.
So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they stoned him with stones in the court of the house of Jehovah.
Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, May Jehovah take notice, and require it!
So it happened at the turning of the year that the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the rulers of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoils to the king of Damascus.
For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers. Thus they executed judgment against Joash.
And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.
These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.
Now concerning his sons, and the great many tributes to him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the midrash of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.
Now it happened, when the kingdom had been secured to him, that he executed his servants who had killed his father the king.
However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where Jehovah had commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; but each shall die for his own sin.
Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, according to their fathers’ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, handling spear and shield.
He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel; with any of the sons of Ephraim.
But if you do go, do it. Be strong in battle. But even so, God shall make you stumble before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.
And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah has much more than this to give you.
So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back to their place. Therefore their anger burned greatly against Judah, and they returned to their place in burning anger.
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led his people and went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the sons of Seir.
And the sons of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were ripped to pieces.
But as for the troops which Amaziah had dismissed, so that they should not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and plundered much spoils.
And it came about, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them.
Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?
So it was, as he spoke with him, that the king said to him, Have we made you the king’s counselor? Stop! Why should you be killed? So the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has given counsel to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my counsel.
Now Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.
And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
Behold, you say that you have struck the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you excite yourself to evil, that you should fall; you and Judah with you?
But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, to deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had resorted to the gods of Edom.
So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.
And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.
And he took all the gold and silver, all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
After the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah, they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.
And they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
And all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.
Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days that he sought Jehovah, God made him prosper.
And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.
God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunim.
The Ammonites also brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.
And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner of the wall, and fortified them.
He also built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.
Moreover Uzziah had forces making war who went out to war by divisions, according to the number of their muster by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders.
The total number of heads of fathers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.
And under their hand was a military force of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
And Uzziah provided for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and stones for the slings.
And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.
But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against Jehovah his God to enter the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of Jehovah; valiant men.
And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from Jehovah God.
And Uzziah became enraged; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.
And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked towards him, and behold, on his forehead he was leprous; so they hurried him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because Jehovah had struck him.
And King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in a separate house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.
Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz has written.
So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his place.
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of Jehovah). But the people continued to do corruptly.
He built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah, and he built extensively on the wall of Ophel.
Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.
He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them. And the children of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The children of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also.
Thus Jotham became mighty, because he had directed his ways before Jehovah his God.
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, like his father David.
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molten images for the Baals.
He burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.
Therefore Jehovah his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They struck him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him down with a great slaughter.
For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.
Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king.
And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoils from them, and brought the spoils to Samaria.
But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to the heavens.
And now you propose to subject the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but do you not also have guilt of your own before Jehovah your God?
Now listen to me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.
Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,
and said to them, You shall not bring the captives here, for we are already guilty before Jehovah. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
So the armed men left the captives and the spoils before the rulers and all the assembly.
Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoils they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees; and returned to Samaria.
At that time King Ahaz had sent to the king of Assyria to help him,
for again the Edomites had come, struck Judah, and carried away captives.
The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its daughter-villages, Timnah with its daughter-villages, and Gimzo with its daughter-villages; and dwelt there.
For Jehovah had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had led Judah into lack of restraints, and to trespass in unfaithfulness unto Jehovah.
And Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not help him.
For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of Jehovah, from the house of the king, and from the rulers, and he gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.
And in the time of his distress he became increasingly unfaithful to Jehovah; this King Ahaz.
For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had struck him, saying, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
So Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, cut in pieces the utensils of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the God of his fathers.
Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
Hezekiah became king when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father David had done.
In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and repaired them.
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together in the east plaza,
and said to them: Hear me, you Levites. Now consecrate yourselves, consecrate the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers, and carry out the filth from the holy place.
For our fathers have been unfaithful and done evil in the eyes of Jehovah our God; they have forsaken Him, have turned their faces away from the dwelling place of Jehovah, and turned their backs on Him.
They have also shut up the doors of the porch, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.
Therefore the wrath of Jehovah is upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has given them up to trembling and terror, to horror, and to hissing, as you see with your eyes.
For behold, because of this our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity.
Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.
Now my sons, do not be negligent, for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should serve Him and burn incense.
Then these Levites rose up: Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah;
of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
And they gathered their brethren, consecrated themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, by the words of Jehovah, to cleanse the house of Jehovah.
And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah, to the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it out and carried it to the Brook Kidron.
And they began to consecrate on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah. Then they consecrated the house of Jehovah in eight days, and by the sixteenth day of the first month they had finished.
And they went in to King Hezekiah and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offerings with all its utensils, and the table of the Bread in Rows with all its utensils.
Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had cast aside in his unfaithfulness we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.
Then King Hezekiah arose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.
And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.
So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
And the priests killed them; and they offered their blood on the altar as a sin offering to make atonement for all Israel; for the king had commanded the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
And he stationed the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for thus was the commandment of Jehovah by the hand of his prophets.
The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
And Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah also began, with the trumpets and by the hand of the instruments of David, king of Israel.
So all the assembly bowed down, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this until the burnt offering was finished.
And when they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and prostrated themselves.
Moreover King Hezekiah and the rulers commanded the Levites to praise Jehovah with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they praised with gladness, and they bowed down and prostrated themselves.
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now that you have confirmed your hands unto Jehovah, come near, and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.
And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these for a burnt offering unto Jehovah.
The consecrated things were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
But the priests were too few, so that they were not able to flay all the burnt offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites supported them until the work was ended and until the other priests had consecrated themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to consecrate themselves than the priests.
Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.
And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the thing came about suddenly.
And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel.
For the king and his rulers and all the assembly in Jerusalem had taken counsel to keep the Passover in the second month.
For they could not keep it at the regular time, because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem.
And the matter was right in the eyes of the king and all the assembly.
So they established a decree throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto Jehovah the God of Israel at Jerusalem, for they had not done it for many days as it is written.
And the runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his rulers, and spoke according to the command of the king: O Children of Israel, return unto Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
And do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who have been unfaithful to Jehovah the God of their fathers, so that He gave them up to desolation, as you see.
Now do not stiffen your necks, like your fathers, but give your hands unto Jehovah; and enter His sanctuary, which He has consecrated for all time, and serve Jehovah your God, that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you.
For if you return to Jehovah, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before those holding them captive, to come back to this land; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn His face from you if you return to Him.
So the runners passed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but they laughed at them, mocking them.
Nevertheless some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
Also the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the rulers, at the Word of Jehovah.
And many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast them into the Brook Kidron.
Then they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and consecrated themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.
They stood in their place according to the ordinance, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.
For many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate them to Jehovah.
For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, O good Jehovah, provide atonement for everyone
who has prepared his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, though not according to the purification of the sanctuary.
And Jehovah gave heed to Hezekiah and healed the people.
So the children of Israel found at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy; and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments unto Jehovah.
And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were teaching the good understanding of Jehovah; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession unto Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And the whole assembly took counsel to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it another seven days with joy.
For Hezekiah king of Judah had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the rulers had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.
The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.
So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
Then the priests, the Levites, rose up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to the heavens.
Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the sacred pillars in pieces, chopped down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars; from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh; until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, each to his possession.
And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.
The king also appointed a portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the new moons and the set feasts, as it is written in the Law of Jehovah.
Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion for the priests and the Levites, that they might grow strong in the Law of Jehovah.
As soon as the word spread, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.
And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God they laid in heaps upon heaps.
In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.
And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah and His people Israel.
And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
And Azariah the chief priest, from the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of Jehovah, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for Jehovah has blessed His people; and what is left is this great abundance.
And Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared them.
And they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the consecrated things; Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother was next.
Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the east gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of Jehovah and the set apart, holy things.
And under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, trusted in the cities of the priests, to distribute to the divisions by the hand of their brethren, to the great as well as the small.
Besides those males from three years old and up who were reckoned by genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of Jehovah his portion day by day for the service of his charge, according to his division,
and to the priests who were reckoned by genealogy according to their father’s house, and to the Levites from twenty years old and up according to their charge, by their divisions,
and to all who were reckoned by genealogy; their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them; for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.
Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the common lands of their cities, in each city, there were men who were designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.
Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God.
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the Law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
After these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to break through for himself.
And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem,
he took counsel with his rulers and mighty men to stop the water from the springs which were outside the city; and they helped him.
So, many people gathered together who stopped all the springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?
And he strengthened himself, built up all the wall that was broken, raised it up to the towers, and built another wall outside; he also restored the Millo in the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.
And he assigned commanders of war over the people, gathered them together to him in the open place of the city gate, and spoke to their heart, saying,
Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that is with him; for there are more with us than with him.
With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God, to help us and to fight our battles. And the people were bolstered by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,
Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: In what are you trusting, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?
Is not Hezekiah enticing you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?
Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall bow down before one altar and burn incense on it?
Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you nor entice you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand.
Furthermore, his servants spoke against Jehovah God and against His servant Hezekiah.
He had also written letters to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.
Then they called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and terrify them, that they might capture the city.
And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the peoples of the lands; the work of men’s hands.
Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to the heavens.
And Jehovah sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, rulers, and commanders in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he went into the house of his god, he fell by the sword of some of the offspring of his own body.
Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
And many brought gifts unto Jehovah at Jerusalem, and choice things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter.
In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death, and he prayed to Jehovah; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign.
But Hezekiah did not return according to the favor shown him, for his heart had become haughty; therefore wrath was over him and over Judah and Jerusalem.
Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable objects;
storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks.
Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property.
This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his pursuits.
However, regarding the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone, to test him, to know all his heart.
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations whom Jehovah had cast out before the children of Israel.
For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and made groves; and he bowed down to all the host of the heavens and served them.
He also built altars in the house of Jehovah, of which Jehovah had said, In Jerusalem shall My name be always.
And he built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Jehovah.
He also caused his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; he practiced fortunetelling, witchcraft and sorcery, and consulted mediums and necromancers. He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.
And he set a graven image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name always;
and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; only if they take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole Law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, to do more evil than the nations whom Jehovah had destroyed before the children of Israel.
And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen.
Therefore Jehovah brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him off to Babylon.
And when he was in distress, he entreated Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
and prayed to Him; and He was entreated of him, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh recognized that Jehovah was God.
After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it encircled Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. And he stationed commanders of the forces in all the fortified cities of Judah.
He took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city.
He also repaired the altar of Jehovah, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.
However the people still sacrificed on the high places; nevertheless to Jehovah their God.
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.
Also his prayer and his entreaty, and all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the places where he built high places and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his place.
Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them.
And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself, but Amon exceeded his guilt.
Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.
But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and walked in the ways of his father David; he did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the groves, the graven images, and the molten images.
They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars which were above them he cut down; and the groves, the graven images, and the molten images he broke in pieces, and pulverized them and scattered them on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem;
and also in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali and all around; with chopping tools.
When he had broken down the altars and the groves, had beaten the carved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Jehovah his God.
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites who kept the doors had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And they gave it into the hand of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of Jehovah; and they gave it to the workmen who worked in the house of Jehovah, to repair and restore the house.
They gave it to the craftsmen and builders to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
And the men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to supervise. Others of the Levites were teaching the instruments of song,
were over the burden bearers, and were overseers of all who did work in any kind of service. And some of the Levites were scribes, officers, and gatekeepers.
Now when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Jehovah, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of Jehovah given by the hand of Moses.
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the Book of the Law in the house of Jehovah. And Hilkiah gave the Book to Shaphan.
So Shaphan carried the Book to the king, bringing the king word, saying, All that was committed to your servants they are doing.
And they have gathered the money that was found in the house of Jehovah, and have given it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen.
Then Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a Book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
And it came about, when the king heard the Words of the Law, that he tore his clothes.
And the king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,
Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for those who are left in Israel and Judah, concerning the Words of the Book that has been found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that has been poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the Word of Jehovah, to do according to all that is written in this Book.
So Hilkiah and those from the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. (She was living in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter.) And they spoke to her regarding this.
And she answered them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Tell the man who has sent you to Me,
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am bringing evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the Book which they have read before the king of Judah,
because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, to provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. Therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus you shall speak to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, whose Words you have heard:
Because your heart has been tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His Words against this place and against its inhabitants, and you humbled yourself before Me, and you tore your clothes and wept before Me, I also have heard you, says Jehovah.
Behold, I am gathering you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants. So they brought back word to the king.
Then the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
And the king went up to the house of Jehovah, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the priests and the Levites, and all the people, great and small. And he read in their ears all the Words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah.
And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul, to do the Words of the covenant that were written in this Book.
And he caused all who were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. So the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the land of the children of Israel, and caused all who were found in Israel to serve, being subject unto Jehovah their God. All his days they did not depart from following Jehovah the God of their fathers.
And Josiah kept a Passover unto Jehovah in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
And he stationed the priests at their charges and encouraged them in the service of the house of Jehovah.
And he said to the Levites who were teaching all Israel, who were set apart unto Jehovah: Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, has built. It shall not be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Jehovah your God and His people Israel.
Prepare yourselves according to your fathers’ houses, according to your divisions, according to the writings of David king of Israel and the writings of Solomon his son.
And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren, the sons of the people, and according to the division of the father’s house of the Levites.
Now slaughter the Passover, consecrate yourselves, and prepare them for your brethren, that they may do according to the Word of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.
And Josiah gave the sons of the people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand oxen; these were from the king’s possessions.
And his rulers contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests two thousand six hundred Passover lambs, and three hundred oxen.
Also Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, contributed to the Levites five thousand Passover lambs, and five hundred oxen.
Thus the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king’s command.
And they slaughtered the Passover lambs; and the priests sprinkled the blood with their hands, while the Levites were flaying.
And they removed the burnt offerings to distribute them by the divisions of the fathers’ houses to the sons of the people, to offer unto Jehovah, as it is written in the Book of Moses; and also with the oxen.
They also roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance; and the other holy things they boiled in pots, in kettles, and in pans, and brought them quickly to all the sons of the people.
Then afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
And the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places, according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not leave their service, because their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
Thus all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Jehovah, according to the command of King Josiah.
And the children of Israel found there, kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days.
And there had not been kept in Israel any Passover like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel found there, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.
After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out to meet him.
But he sent messengers to him, saying, What have I to do with you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God has commanded me to make haste. Refrain from meddling with God, who is with me, that you not be destroyed.
Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.
And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.
His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
Jeremiah also lamented for Josiah. And to this day all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. They made it an ordinance in Israel; and behold, they are written in the Lamentations.
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to what was written in the Law of Jehovah,
and his deeds from first to last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem.
Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem; and he fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
Then the king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother and brought him to Egypt.
Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God.
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in bronze fetters to carry him to Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar also brought away some of the vessels from the house of Jehovah to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, the abominations which he had done, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
At the turn of the year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels from the house of Jehovah, and made Zedekiah, Jehoiakim’s brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah his God, and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of Jehovah.
And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had adjured him by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Jehovah the God of Israel.
Moreover all the rulers of the priests and the people trespassed with great unfaithfulness, according to all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the house of Jehovah which He had consecrated in Jerusalem.
And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by the hand of His messengers, rising early to send them, because He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place.
But they mocked the messengers of God, despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, to make the wrath of Jehovah swell up against His people, till there was no healing.
Therefore He brought against them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, on the aged or the weak; He gave them all into his hand.
And all the vessels from the house of God, great and small, the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king and of his rulers, all these he carried away to Babylon.
And they burned the house of God, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed every desirable thing.
And those who escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon, where they became servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia;
to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days to lay desolate, it kept the Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,
Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Jehovah the God of the heavens has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He has laid a charge upon me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah. Whoever among you of all His people: Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the Word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying,
Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: Jehovah the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem which is in Judah.
Who is there among you of all His people? His God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah, and build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel (He is God), which is in Jerusalem.
And whoever remains in any place where he dwells, let the men of his place help him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, besides the freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.
Then the heads of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, with all those whose spirit God had aroused to go up and build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem,
and all those who were around them, encouraged their hands with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods;
and Cyrus king of Persia brought them out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
This is the number of them: thirty gold platters, one thousand silver platters, twenty-nine knives,
thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten silver basins of a second kind, and one thousand other articles.
All the articles of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar took with the captives who were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.
Now these are the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his own city.
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:
the sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two;

the sons of Senaah, three thousand six hundred and thirty.
The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three;
the sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;
the sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;
the sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.
The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah, seventy-four.
The singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred and twenty-eight.
The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, and the sons of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-nine in all.
The temple slaves: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,
the sons of Keros, the sons of Siaha, the sons of Padon,
the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Akkub,
the sons of Hagab, the sons of Shalmai, the sons of Hanan,
the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah,
the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam,
the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai,
the sons of Asnah, the sons of Mehunim, the sons of Nephusim,
the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,
the sons of Bazluth, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,
the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Tamah,
the sons of Neziah, and the sons of Hatipha.
The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Peruda,
the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim, and the sons of Ami.
All the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two.
And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not identify their father’s house or their seed, whether they were of Israel:
the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, and the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two;
and of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, and the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name.
These sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were considered desecrated, and excluded from the priesthood.
And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the set apart, holy, things till a priest should stand with Urim and Thummim.
The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and there were two hundred singing men and singing women.
Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,
their camels four hundred and thirty-five, and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
Some of the heads of the fathers, when they came to the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God, to erect it in its place:
According to their ability, they gave to the treasury for the work sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments.
So the priests and the Levites, some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple slaves, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.
Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those lands, they set the altar on its bases; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Jehovah, both the morning and evening burnt offerings.
They also kept the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered day by day the burnt offerings by number, as commanded by ordinance, day by day.
Afterward they offered the continual burnt offering, and those for the new moons and for all the appointed meetings of Jehovah that were consecrated, and those of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to Jehovah.
From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to Jehovah, although the foundation of the temple of Jehovah had not been laid.
They also gave money to the masons and the craftsmen, and food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.
Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began, and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah.
Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Judah, arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God: the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah, according to the ordinance of David king of Israel.
And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to Jehovah: For He is good, for His mercy is eternal toward Israel. Then all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised Jehovah, because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.
But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes. And many shouted aloud for joy,
so that the people could not discern the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard afar off.
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity were building the temple of Jehovah the God of Israel,
they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do; and we have sacrificed to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.
But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel said to them, It is not for you to build a house for our God with us; but we ourselves together will build unto Jehovah the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah. They troubled them in building,
and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
In the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabel, and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the letter was written in Aramaic, and translated from the Aramaic.
Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates; representatives of Dinah, Apharsath, Tarpelah, the people of Persia and Erech and Babylon and Shushan, Dehah, the Elam,
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar took captive and settled in the cities of Samaria and the remainder beyond the River; and now:
(This is a copy of the letter that they sent him) To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men of the region beyond the River, and now:
Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem, and are building the rebellious and evil city, and are finishing its walls and repairing the foundations.
Let it now be known to the king, that if this city is rebuilt and the walls completed, they will not pay tax, tribute, or toll, and the king’s treasury will be damaged.
Now because we derive our subsistence from the palace, it was not proper for us to see the king’s dishonor; therefore we have sent and informed the king,
that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers; and you will find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that they have carried out revolts within the city in ancient times, for which cause this city was destroyed.
We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, then because of it you will have no possession beyond the River.
The king sent an answer: To Rehum the commander, to Shimshai the scribe, to the rest of their associates who dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the River: Peace! And now:
The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me.
And I gave command, and a search has been made, and it was found that this city in ancient times has risen up against kings, and rebellion and revolt have been carried out in it.
There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the region beyond the River; and tax, tribute, and toll were paid to them.
Now give the command to make these men cease, that this city not be built until the command is given from me.
Take heed now that you do not fail to do this. Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?
Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went up in haste to Jerusalem against the Jews, and by force of arms made them cease.
Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it came to be ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
At the same time Tatnai the governor of the region beyond the River and Shethar-Boznai and their associates came to them and spoke thus to them: Who has commanded you to build this house and finish this wall?
And then spoke to them in this manner: What are the names of the men building this building?
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they could not make them cease till the matter should be brought before Darius. Then they replied by letter concerning this.
This is a copy of the letter that Tatnai, the governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and his associates, the Persians who were in the region beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king: All peace.
Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is being built with rolling stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.
Then we asked those elders, and spoke thus to them: Who commanded you to build this house and to finish these walls?
We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who are chief among them.
And thus they returned an answer to us, saying: We are the servants of the God of Heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed.
But because our fathers provoked the God of Heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who has destroyed this house and carried the people away to Babylon.
However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God.
Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that was in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon; those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.
And he said to him, Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its place.
Then that same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been building, and it is not yet finished.
Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, to find out whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his will concerning this matter.
Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the house of the scrolls, where the treasures were stored in Babylon.
And at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and in it a record was written thus:
In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits,
with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber. Let the expenses be paid out of the king’s house.
Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its place; and deposit them in the house of God.
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor of the region beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your associates the Persians who are beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there.
Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its place.
Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the king’s riches from the tribute of the region beyond the River be diligently given to these men for their expenses, so that they are not hindered.
And whatever they need; young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of Heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the command of the priests who are in Jerusalem; let it be given them day by day without fail,
that they may offer sacrifices of soothing aroma unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap for this.
And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue a decree; let it be done diligently.
Then Tatnai, governor of the region beyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and their associates diligently did according to what King Darius had sent.
So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
And the house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the sons of the captivity, carried out the dedication of this house of God with joy.
And they offered at the dedication of this house of God, one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
They assigned the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their divisions, over the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
And the sons of the captivity observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
For the priests and the Levites were purified together; all of them were pure. And they slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the sons of the captivity, for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land in order to seek Jehovah the God of Israel.
And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;
this Ezra came up from Babylon; and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given. The king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him.
Some of the children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple slaves came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
On the first day of the first month he began his journey from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of Jehovah, and to do it, and to teach the statutes and ordinances in Israel.
This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra the priest, the scribe, expert in the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of His statutes to Israel:
Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the Law of the God of Heaven: Perfect peace, and now:
I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm, who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you.
And whereas you are being sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand;
and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem;
and whereas all the silver and gold that you may find in all the province of Babylon, along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, are to be freely offered for the house of their God in Jerusalem;
now therefore, be diligent to buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.
And whatever seems good to you and your brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do it according to the will of your God.
Also the articles that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.
And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, pay for it from the king’s treasure house.
And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of Heaven, may require of you, let it be done diligently,
up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred kors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without stipulation.
Whatever is commanded by the God of Heaven, let it diligently be done for the house of the God of Heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or toll upon any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple slaves, or servants of this house of God.
And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the Laws of your God; and teach those who do not know them.
Whoever will not observe the Law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed diligently upon him, whether it be death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.
Blessed be Jehovah the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this into the king’s heart, to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem,
and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty rulers. So I was encouraged, as the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me; and I gathered chief men of Israel to go up with me.
These are the heads of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;
of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah; and registered with him were one hundred and fifty males;
of the sons of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;
of the sons of Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;
of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;
of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;
of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males;
of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males;
of the sons of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males;
of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;
of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred and ten males;
of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah; and with them sixty males;
also of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And I considered the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.
Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding.
And I gave them a command for Iddo, chief of the place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouth to speak to Iddo and his brethren the temple slaves at the place Casiphia; that they should bring to us servants for the house of our God.
Then, by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, eighteen;
and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;
also of the temple slaves, whom David and the rulers had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty temple slaves. All of them were designated by name.
Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him the right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions.
For I was ashamed to request of the king troops and horsemen to help us against the enemy along the road, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him.
So we fasted and entreated our God for this, and He was entreated of us.
Then I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests; Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them;
and weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his rulers, and all Israel who were present, had contributed.
I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, silver articles weighing one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold,
twenty gold basins worth a thousand drachmas, and two vessels of fine polished bronze, precious as gold.
And I said to them, You are holy unto Jehovah; the articles are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto Jehovah the God of your fathers.
Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites and heads of the fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.
So the priests and the Levites accepted the silver and the gold by weight and the articles, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road.
So we came to Jerusalem, and remained there three days.
Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui;
with the number and weight of everything. All the weight was written down at that time.
The children of those who had been carried away captive, who had come from the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering unto Jehovah.
And they delivered the king’s orders to the king’s satraps and the governors in the region beyond the River. So they gave support to the people and the house of God.
When these things were done, the rulers came to me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, with respect to the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
For they have taken some of their daughters for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of those lands. Indeed, the hand of the rulers and officials has been foremost in this treachery.
So when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down astonished.
Then everyone who trembled at the Words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the treachery of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.
At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God.
And I said: O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have increased over our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the Heavens.
Since the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt, and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to shame of faces, to this day.
And now for a little while grace has been shown from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
For we were slaves; yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to set up the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,
which You have commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.
Now therefore, do not give your daughters for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; nor seek after their peace or prosperity forever, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land, and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.
And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have held back from the bending down in punishment of our iniquities, and have given us such deliverance as this,
should we again break Your commandments, and join in marriage with the people of these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You had finished us off, so that there would be no remnant or escapee?
O Jehovah the God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left as refugees, as it is this day. Here we are before You, in our guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this!
Now while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and falling prostrate before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him out of Israel; for the people wept with a great weeping.
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and are dwelling with foreign women from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this.
Now therefore, let us make a covenant with our God to bring out all these women and those who have been born to them, according to the counsel of the Lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the Law.
Arise, for this matter is up to you. We also are with you. Be strong, and do it.
Then Ezra arose, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this word. So they swore.
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he ate no bread and drank no water, for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the captivity.
And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the sons of the captivity, to assemble at Jerusalem,
and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the rulers and elders, all his property would be destroyed, and he himself would be excluded from the assembly of those from the captivity.
So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the open square of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, You have transgressed and have dwelt with foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel.
Now therefore, make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do His will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, Yes! As you have said, so we need to do.
But there are many people; it is the season for heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for there are many of us who have transgressed in this matter.
Please, let our rulers be appointed out of the whole assembly; and let all those in our cities who have dwelt with foreign women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their cities, until the fierce wrath of our God in this matter is turned away from us.
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah stood against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.
And the sons of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest set apart some of the men, heads of fathers, according to the houses of their fathers, each of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
By the first day of the first month they finished investigating all the men who had dwelt with foreign women.
And among the sons of the priests who had dwelt with foreign women, the following were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.
And they gave their hands that they would put away their women; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their sin.
Also of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;
of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;
of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
Also of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (the same is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
Also of the singers: Eliashib; and of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
And others of Israel: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;
of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah;
of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;
of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;
of the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth;
of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;
of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;
of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;
of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluh,
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasau,
Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah.
All these had taken foreign women, some being women with whom they brought forth children.
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. It came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
And they said to me, The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.
So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and was fasting and praying before the God of Heaven.
And I said, I beseech You, O Jehovah the God of Heaven, O great and awesome Mighty God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and keep Your commandments:
Let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned.
We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses.
Remember, I beseech You, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the nations;
but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though you were cast out to the ends of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place where I have chosen to establish My name.
Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand.
O Lord, I beseech You, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who delight to fear Your name; and give Your servant success this day, and grant him mercy before this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.
And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before.
Therefore the king said to me, Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid,
and said to the king, May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?
Then the king said to me, What do you request? So I prayed to the God of Heaven.
And I said to the king, If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.
Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), How long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
Furthermore I said to the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me to the governors of the region beyond the River, that they may allow me to pass through till I come to Judah;
and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the temple which pertains to the house, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy. And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.
Then I went to the governors in the region beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, heard of it, it made them shudder over the great evil, that a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.
And I arose in the night, I and a few men with me. I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode.
And I went out by night through the Valley Gate, to the Serpent Spring and the Refuse Gate, and examined the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and its gates which had been consumed with fire.
Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass.
So I went up in the night by the river, and examined the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.
And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the rulers, or the others who did the work.
Then I said to them, You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.
And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me. Then they said, Let us rise up and build. So they encouraged their hands for this good work.
But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they mocked and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?
So I answered them, and said to them, The God of Heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.
Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and built the Sheep Gate; they consecrated it and set up its doors. As far as the Tower of Meah, they consecrated it; even as far as the Tower of Hananel.
Next to them the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.
Also the sons of Hassenaah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors with its bolts and bars.
And next to them Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, made repairs. Next to them Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs. Next to them Zadok the son of Baana made repairs.
Next to them the Tekoites made repairs; but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.
Moreover Jehoiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors, with its bolts and bars.
And next to them Melatiah the Gibeonite, Jadon the Meronothite, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, repaired, to the throne of the governor of the region beyond the River.
Next to him Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. Also next to him Hananiah, the son of one of the perfumers, made repairs; and they left Jerusalem safe as far as the Broad Wall.

And next to him was Shallum the son of Hallohesh, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem; he and his daughters made repairs.
Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate. They built it, set up its doors with its bolts and bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the Refuse Gate.
Malchijah the son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-haccerem, repaired the Refuse Gate; he built it and set up its doors with its bolts and bars.
Shallun the son of Col-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he built it, covered it, set up its doors with its bolts and bars, and repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah by the King’s Garden, as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David.
After him Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth Zur, made repairs as far as the place in front of the Tombs of David, to the pool that was made, and as far as the House of the Mighty.
After him the Levites, under Rehum the son of Bani, made repairs. Next to him Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, made repairs in his district.
After him their brethren, under Bavai the son of Henadad, ruler of the other half of the district of Keilah, made repairs.
And next to him Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent to the armory at the buttress.
After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other section, from the buttress to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
After him Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, repaired another section, from the door of the house of Eliashib to the end of the house of Eliashib.
And after him the priests, the men of the plain, made repairs.
After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs across from their house. After them Azariah the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs by his house.
After him Binnui the son of Henadad repaired another section, from the house of Azariah to the buttress, even as far as the corner.
Palal the son of Uzai made repairs across from the buttress, and on the tower which projects out from the king’s upper house that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh made repairs.
Moreover the temple slaves who dwelt in Ophel made repairs from in front of the Water Gate toward the east, and on the projecting tower.
After them the Tekoites repaired another section, next to the great projecting tower, even as far as the wall of Ophel.
Beyond the Horse Gate the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house.
After them Zadok the son of Immer made repairs in front of his own house. After him Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the East Gate, made repairs.
After him Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. After him Meshullam the son of Berechiah made repairs in front of his room.
After him Malchijah, a son of one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple slaves and of the merchants, in front of the Miphkad Gate, and as far as the upper room at the corner.
And between the upper room at the corner, as far as the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and the merchants made repairs.
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, that he was furious and very indignant, and mocked the Jews.
And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish; stones that are burned?
Now Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall.
Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach upon their own heads, and give them as spoils to a land of captivity.
Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders.
So we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a heart to work.
And it came to pass, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem had been restored up and the gaps had begun to be closed, that they were greatly infuriated,
and all of them conspired together to come and make war against Jerusalem and to create confusion.
Nevertheless we prayed unto our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.
Then Judah said, The strength of the laborers is stumbling, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.
And our adversaries said, They will neither know nor see anything, till we have come into their midst and killed them and put an end to the work.
So it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, From whatever place you return, they will be upon us.
Therefore I stationed men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the bare places; and I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
And it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had broken their counsel, that all of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.
So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants did the work, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they did the work, and with the other held a weapon.
Every one who was building had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the shofar was beside me.
Then I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall.
Wherever you hear the sound of the shofar, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.
So we did the work, and half of the men held the spears from the rising of the dawn until the stars came out.
At the same time I also said to the people, Let each man and his servant lodge inside Jerusalem, that they may be a guard to us by night and workers by day.
So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone sent them away for washing.
And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their brothers the Jews.
For there were those who said, We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.
There were also some who said, We have mortgaged our fields and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.
There were also those who said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our power to redeem them, for other men have our fields and vineyards.
And I was extremely infuriated when I heard their outcry and these words.
After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, Each of you is exacting usury from his brother. So I appointed a great assembly against them.
And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers, the Jews who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brothers? Or should they be sold to us? Then they were silenced and found nothing to answer.
Then I said, What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Now let us leave off this usury!
Restore now to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.
So they said, We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say. Then I called the priests, and caused them to swear that they would do according to this word.
I also shook out empty the bosom of my garment and said, So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not carry out this word. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen! and praised Jehovah. Then the people did according to this word.
Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers have eaten the food of the governor.
But the former governors who had been before me were heavy on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.
Indeed, I also prevailed in the work of this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work.
And at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us.
Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in all of this I did not demand the food of the governor, because the labor was heavy on this people.
Remember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.
Now it came to pass when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and that there were no breaks left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do evil to me.
So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?
But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.
Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand.
In it was written: It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; for which reason, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king.
And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah! Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.
Then I sent to him, saying, No such things as you say are being done, but you contrive them out of your own heart.
For they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was under restraints; and he said, Let us gather in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.
And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!
Then I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and do accordingly and sin, to make for a bad reputation, that they might reproach me.
My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these works of theirs, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were terrifying me.
So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.
And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work had been done by our God.
Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and those from Tobiah came to them.
For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken in marriage the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
They also reported his good deeds before me, and were delivering my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid.
Now it came to pass when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed;
that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.
And I said to them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one at his post, each across from his house.
Now the city was broad and large, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt.
Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return, and found written in it:
These are the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city.
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

the sons of Bazlith, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,

The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Sophereth, the sons of Perida,
the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,
the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim, and the sons of Amon.
All the temple slaves, and the sons of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred and ninety-two.
And these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not declare their father’s house nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:
the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two;
and of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name.
These sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore they were considered desecrated, and excluded from the priesthood.
And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the set apart, holy, things till a priest should stand with Urim and Thummim.
Altogether the whole assembly was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five singing men and singing women.
Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,
their camels four hundred and thirty-five, and donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
And some of the heads of the fathers gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand gold drachmas, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly garments.
Some of the heads of the fathers gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand gold drachmas, and two thousand two hundred silver minas.
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly garments.
So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the temple slaves, and all Israel dwelt in their cities. When the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
Now all the people gathered together as one man in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate; and they commanded Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which Jehovah had charged Israel.
So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women, and all who could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month.
And he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.
So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
And Ezra opened the book in the eyes of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up.
And Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. Then all the people answered, Amen, Amen! while lifting up their hands. And they bowed down and prostrated themselves before Jehovah with their faces to the ground.
Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place.
So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped them to understand the reading.
And Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, This day is holy to Jehovah your God; do not mourn nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the Words of the Law.
Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of Jehovah is your refuge.
So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.
And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the Words that had been declared to them.
Now on the second day the heads of the fathers of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to have insight into the Words of the Law.
And they found written in the Law, which Jehovah had commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month,
and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, Go out to the mountain, and bring olive foliage, foliage of oil trees, myrtle foliage, palm foliage, and foliage of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.
Then the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths, each one on their roofs, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim.
So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness.
Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the prescribed manner.
Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, in sackcloth, and earth upon them.
Then the seed of Israel separated themselves from the children of the foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of Jehovah their God for a fourth part of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and prostrated themselves before Jehovah their God.
Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to Jehovah their God.
And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said: Stand up and bless Jehovah your God forever and ever! Blessed is Your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise!
You alone are Jehovah; You have made the heavens, the Heaven of the heavens, with all their host, the earth and everything on it, the seas and all that is in them, and You preserve them all alive. The host of the Heavens bow down before You.
You are Jehovah God, who chose Abram, and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and placed upon him the name Abraham;
You found his heart faithful before You, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites; to give it to his seed. You have performed Your words, for You are just.
You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red Sea.
You gave signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, upon all his servants, and upon all the people of his land. For You knew that they had acted proudly against them. So You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day.
And You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and those pursuing them You threw into the deep, as a stone into the mighty waters.
Moreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar, and by night with a pillar of fire, to give them light on the way which they should travel.
You came down also on Mount Sinai, and spoke with them from the heavens, and gave them just ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments.
You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes and Laws, by the hand of Your servant Moses.
You gave them bread from the heavens for their hunger, and brought forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and intended for them to go in to possess the land which You had raised Your hand and sworn to give them.
But they and our fathers acted presumptuously, hardened their necks, and did not heed Your commandments,
and refused to obey, and they were not mindful of Your wonders that You did among them. But they hardened their necks, and in their rebellion they appointed a leader to return to their bondage. But You are God, ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abundant in kindness; and did not forsake them.
Even when they made a molten calf for themselves, and said, This is your god that brought you up out of Egypt, and worked great blasphemies;
yet in Your manifold mercies You did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them on the road; nor the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way they should go.
You also gave Your good Spirit to teach them, and did not withhold Your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.
Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing; their clothes did not wear out and their feet did not swell.
Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations, and divided them into districts. So they took possession of the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
You also multiplied their children as the stars of the heavens, and brought them into the land which You had commanded their fathers to go in and possess it.
So the people went in and possessed the land; You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they pleased.
And they captured strong cities and a rich land, and took possession of houses full of all goods, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate and were filled and grew fat, and lived luxuriously in Your great goodness.
Nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against You, cast Your Law behind their backs and killed Your prophets, who testified against them to turn them to Yourself; and they worked great blasphemies.
Therefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them; and in the time of their trouble, when they cried out to You, You heard from Heaven; and according to Your abundant mercies You gave them deliverers who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
But after they had rest, they returned to doing evil before You. Therefore You left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had dominion over them; yet when they returned and cried out to You, You heard from Heaven; and many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,
and testified against them, that You might bring them back to Your Law. Yet they acted presumptuously, and did not heed Your commandments, but sinned against Your judgments, which if a man does, he shall live by them. And they shrugged their shoulders, stiffened their necks, and would not obey.
Yet for many years You had patience with them, and testified against them by Your Spirit by the hand of Your prophets. Yet they would not listen; therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
Nevertheless in Your great mercy You did not annihilate them nor forsake them; for You are the Mighty God, gracious and merciful.
Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and awesome Mighty God, who keeps covenant and mercy: Do not let all the trouble seem small before You that has found us, our kings and our rulers, our priests and our prophets, our fathers and all Your people, since the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.
However You are just in all that has come upon us; for You have dealt faithfully, but we have done wickedly.
Neither our kings nor our princes, our priests nor our fathers, have kept Your Law, nor paid attention to Your commandments and Your testimonies, with which You testified against them.
For they have not served You in their kingdom, nor in the great goodness that You gave them, nor in the large and rich land which You set before them; nor did they turn from their evil works.
Here we are, servants this day! And the land that You gave to our fathers, to eat its fruit and its bounty; behold, we are servants in it.
And it yields much increase to the kings You have set over us, because of our sins; also they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle at their pleasure; and we are in great distress.
And because of all this, we are making a covenant in good faith, and writing it; sealed by our rulers, our Levites, and our priests.
Now those who placed their seal on the document were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hachaliah, and Zedekiah,
Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,
Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These were the priests.
The Levites: Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, and Kadmiel.
Their brethren: Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,
Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
Hodijah, Bani, and Beninu.
The rulers of the people: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,
Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,
Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,
Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,
Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,
Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,
Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
Now the rest of the people; the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple slaves, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding;
these joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse and an oath to walk in God’s Law, which was given by the hand of Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and His ordinances and His statutes:
We would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons.
If the peoples of the land brought wares or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath, nor on a holy day; and we would forego the seventh year’s produce and the tribute from every hand.
Also we established a command for ourselves, to designate from ourselves yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God:
for the Bread in Rows, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering of the Sabbaths, the New Moons, and the set feasts; for the holy things, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
We cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for bringing the wood offering into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at the appointed times year by year, to burn on the altar of Jehovah our God as it is written in the Law.
And to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, to the house of Jehovah;
to bring the firstborn of our sons and our cattle, as it is written in the Law, and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks, to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God;
to bring the firstfruits of our dough, our offerings, the fruit from all kinds of trees, the new wine and oil, to the priests, to the rooms of the house of our God; and the tithes of our land to the Levites, that the Levites should receive the tithes in all the cities of our labor.
And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall bring up a tithe of the tithes to the house of our God, to the rooms of the storehouse.
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, to the rooms where the articles of the sanctuary are, where the priests who minister and the gatekeepers and the singers are; and we will not neglect the house of our God.
Now the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem. And the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine-tenths were to dwell in other cities.
And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
These are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their cities; Israelites, priests, Levites, temple slaves, and sons of Solomon’s servants.)
Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin. The sons of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the sons of Perez;
and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.
All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.
And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah;
and after him Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight.
Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.
Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, and Jachin;
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God.
Their brethren who did the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah,
and his brethren, heads of the fathers, were two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
and their brethren, mighty men of valor, were one hundred and twenty-eight. Their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men.
Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the heads of the Levites, had the oversight of the business outside of the house of God;
Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the leader who began the thanksgiving with prayer; Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.
Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren who kept the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two.
And the rest of Israel, of the priests and Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance.
But the temple slaves dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple slaves.
Also the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers who were over the service of the house of God.
For it was the king’s command concerning them that there should be financial support for the singers, a quota for each day.
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people.
And as for the villages with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, Jekabzeel and its villages;
in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet,
Hazar Shual, and Beer-sheba and its villages;
in Ziklag and Mekonah and its villages;
in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,
Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages; in Lachish and its fields; in Azekah and its villages. They dwelt from Beer-sheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
Also the children of Benjamin from Geba dwelt in Michmash, Aija, and Bethel, and their villages;
in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah;
in Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim;
in Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat;
in Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen.
Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah were in Benjamin.
Now these are the priests and the Levites who came up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the heads of the priests and their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
Moreover the Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah who led the songs of praise, he and his brethren.
Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, stood next to them in their service.
Jeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada,
Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.
Now in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of the fathers were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
of Abijah, Zichri; the son of Minjamin of Moadiah, Piltai;
of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
During the reign of Darius the Persian, a record was also kept of the Levites and priests who had been heads of their fathers in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua.
The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib, were written in the book of the chronicles.
And the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers next to them, to praise and give thanks, group next to group, according to the command of David the man of God.
Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the thresholds of the gates.
These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to attend to the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgiving and singing, with cymbals and lutes and harps.
And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of Netophah,
from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem.
Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
So I brought the rulers of Judah up on the wall, and stationed two large thanksgiving choirs. One went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate.
Following behind them went Hoshaiah and half of the rulers of Judah,
and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets; Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the instruments of song of David the man of God. And Ezra the scribe went before them.
And at the Fountain Gate across from them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, at the ascent of the wall above the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward.
And the other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way, and I followed behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall,
and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of Meah, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stood still by the Gate of the Prison.
So the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and half the rulers with me;
and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang aloud with Jezrahiah as their overseer.
Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even at a distance.
And at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered.
Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David and Solomon his son.
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were heads of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated holy things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for the sons of Aaron.
On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the ears of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should come into the assembly of God forever,
because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.
Now before this, Eliashib the priest, being entrusted with the rooms of the house of our God, being related to Tobiah,
had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the utensils, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests.
But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had come to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king,
and I came to Jerusalem and perceived the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God.
And it grieved me exceedingly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room.
Then I commanded them to purify the rooms; and I brought back into them the utensils of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.
I also perceived that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had fled to his field.
So I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place.
Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil into the storehouse.
And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brethren.
Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services.
In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I admonished them about the day on which they were selling food.
Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of merchandise, and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, even in Jerusalem.
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, profaning the Sabbath day?
Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet you bring added wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath!
So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens should be brought in on the Sabbath day.
So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
Then I warned them, and said to them, Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you! From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath.
And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to consecrate the Sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy.
In those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the Jewish language, but according to the tongue of nation to nation.
So I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.
Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, acting treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?
And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
Thus I cleansed them of everything foreign. I also appointed duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service,
and for the wood offering and the firstfruits at the appointed times. Remember me, O my God, for good!
Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this was the Ahasuerus who reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India to Ethiopia),
in those days when King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
that in the third year of his reign he made a feast for all his officials and servants; the powers of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the rulers of the provinces being before him;
when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendor of his excellent greatness for many days, even one hundred and eighty days.
And when these days were completed, the king made a feast lasting seven days for all the people who were found in Shushan the palace, from great to small, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
There were white and violet linen curtains fastened with cords of fine linen and purple on silver rods and marble pillars; and the couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of red, turquoise, and pearl and black marble.
And they served drinks in golden vessels, each vessel being different from the other, with royal wine in abundance, according to the hand of the king.
In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had ordered all the officers of his household, that they should do according to each man’s pleasure.
Queen Vashti also made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, seven officials who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,
to bring Queen Vashti before the king, wearing her royal crown, in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials; for she was beautiful in appearance.
But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command brought by his officials; therefore the king was furious, and his rage burned within him.
Then the king said to the wise men who understood the times (for this was the king’s manner toward all who knew law and judgment,
those closest to him being Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media, who had access to the king’s presence, and who sat first in the kingdom):
What shall we do to Queen Vashti, according to law, because she has not observed the command of King Ahasuerus brought to her by the officials?
And Memucan answered before the king and the rulers: Queen Vashti has not only wronged the king, but also all the rulers, and all the people who are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
For the queen’s behavior will become known to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when they report, King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought in before him, but she did not come.
And this day the noble ladies of Persia and Media will say the same to all the king’s officials, when they have heard of the behavior of the queen. Thus there will be more than enough contempt and wrath.
If it please the king, let a royal decree go out from him, and let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it shall not become obsolete, that Vashti shall come no more before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal power to another woman who is better than she.
And when the king’s decree which he will make is proclaimed throughout all his empire (for it is great), all wives will honor their husbands, both great and small.
And the words pleased the king and the rulers, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.
Then he sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own writing, and to every people in their own language: That each man should rule in his own house; and that it should be spoken in the language of each nation.
After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed against her.
Then the king’s servants who ministered to him said: Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king;
and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the beautiful young virgins to Shushan the palace, into the women’s house, under the hand of Hegai the king’s official, custodian of the women. And let cosmetics be given to them.
Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite.
Kish had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been captured with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah (that is, Esther), his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. And the young woman was of a beautiful figure and good appearance. At the death of her father and mother Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter.
So it was, when the king’s command and decree were heard, and when many young women were gathered at Shushan the palace, under the hand of Hegai, that Esther also was taken to the king’s house, into the hand of Hegai the custodian of the women.
Now the young woman was good in his eyes, and she obtained his favor; so he rushed to supply her cosmetics, along with her other provisions. And seven choice maidservants were provided for her from the king’s house, and he moved her and her maidservants to the best place in the house of the women.
Esther had not revealed her people or family, for Mordecai had charged her not to reveal it.
And every day Mordecai walked around in front of the court of the women’s house, to learn of Esther’s welfare and what was happening with her.
Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after she had completed twelve months according to the regulations for the women, for thus were the days of their beautification accomplished: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and preparations for beautifying women.
Thus prepared, each young woman went to the king, and she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the women’s house to the king’s house.
In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to the second house of the women, to the hand of Shaashgaz, the king’s official who kept the concubines. She would not go in to the king again unless the king delighted in her and summoned her by name.
Now when the turn came for Esther (the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her as his daughter), to go in to the king, she requested nothing but what Hegai the king’s official, the custodian of the women, commanded. And Esther rose to favor in the eyes of all who saw her.
So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, into his royal house, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained grace and favor in his presence more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
And the king made a great feast, the Feast of Esther, for all his rulers and servants; and he instituted a holiday in the provinces and gave gifts according to the hand of the king.
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.
Now Esther had not revealed her kindred nor her people, just as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther obeyed the command of Mordecai as when she was brought up by him.
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s officials, Bigthan and Teresh, doorkeepers, became furious and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
And the matter became known to Mordecai, who told Queen Esther, and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.
And when an inquiry was made into the matter, it was confirmed, and both were hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.
After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the rulers who were with him.
And all the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow nor pay homage.
Then the king’s servants who were in the king’s gate said to Mordecai, Why do you transgress the king’s command?
Now it happened, when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.
When Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was filled with rage.
But it was contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Therefore, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus; the people of Mordecai.
In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur (that is, the lot), before Haman from day to day and month to month, until it fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from all other people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not fitting for the king to let them remain.
If it pleases the king, let a decree be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the one harassing the Jews.
And the king said to Haman, The money and the people are given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.
Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and a decree was written according to all that Haman commanded; to the king’s satraps, to the governors who were over each province, to the rulers of all the people, to every province according to its writing, and to every people in their language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king’s signet ring.
And the letters were sent by runners into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to exterminate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their possessions;
a copy of the document to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day.
The runners went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the palace. So the king and Haman sat down to drink. But the city of Shushan was perplexed.
When Mordecai learned all that had happened, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried out with a loud and bitter cry.
He went as far as the front of the king’s gate: for no one was to enter the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
And in every province where the king’s command and decree arrived, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
So Esther’s maids and officials came and reported it to her, and the queen was exceedingly distressed. Then she sent garments to clothe Mordecai and take his sackcloth away from him, but he would not accept them.
Then Esther called Hathach, one of the king’s officials whom he had appointed to attend her, and she gave him a command concerning Mordecai, to learn what and why this was.
So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king’s gate.
And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasuries to destroy the Jews.
He also gave him a copy of the written decree for their destruction, which was given at Shushan, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her, and that he might command her to go in to the king to make supplication to him and plead before him for her people.
So Hathach returned and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
Again Esther spoke to Hathach, and charged him to say to Mordecai:
All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that any man or woman who goes into the inner court to the king, who has not been summoned, has but one law: to put all to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter, that he may live. Furthermore, I have not been called to go in to the king these thirty days.
And they told Mordecai Esther’s words.
And Mordecai told them to answer Esther: Do not think in your soul that you will escape in the king’s house any more than all the other Jews.
For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house shall perish. Yet who knows whether you have attained unto the kingdom for such a time as this?
Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai:
Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast for me; neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will fast likewise. And so I will go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I have perished, I have perished!
So Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther commanded him.
Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, across from the king’s house, while the king sat on his royal throne in the royal house, in front of the gate of the house.
So it was, when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, that she found favor in his eyes, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther went near and touched the top of the scepter.
And the king said to her, What do you wish, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given to you, even to half the kingdom.
And Esther answered, If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
Then the king said, Summon Haman quickly, that he may do according to Esther’s word. So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
At the banquet of wine the king said to Esther, What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your request? And it shall be done, even to half the kingdom.
Then Esther answered and said, My petition and request is this:
If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, then let the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do according to the word of the king.
So Haman went out that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and that he did not stand or tremble before him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.
Nevertheless Haman restrained himself and went to his house, and he sent and summoned his friends and his wife Zeresh.
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, the multitude of his children, everything in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the rulers and servants of the king.
Moreover Haman said, In addition to that, Queen Esther invited no one to come in with the king to the banquet that she prepared, except me; and tomorrow I am again invited by her, along with the king.
Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.
Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made, fifty cubits high, and in the morning suggest to the king that Mordecai be hanged on it; then go joyfully with the king to the banquet. And these words were good to Haman; so he had the gallows made.
That night sleep fled from the king. So it was commanded to bring the book of the records of the chronicles; and they were recited before the king.
And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officials, the doorkeepers who had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.
Then the king said, What honor or dignity has been bestowed upon Mordecai for this? And the king’s servants who attended him said, Nothing has been done for him.
So the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s house to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
The king’s servants said to him, Behold, Haman is standing in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
So Haman came in, and the king said unto him, What shall be done for the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, Whom would the king delight to honor more than myself?
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor:
Let the royal apparel be brought which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, and the royal crown which has been placed upon his head.
Then let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble rulers, that he may array the man whom the king delights to honor. Then have him ride on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him: Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!
Then the king said to Haman, Hurry! Take the apparel and the horse, just as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew who sits in the king’s gate! Do not fail to do any of all that you have spoken.
So Haman took the apparel and the horse, arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the city square, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor!
Afterward Mordecai went back to the king’s gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.
When Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the seed of the Jews, you will not prevail against him but shall be thrown down and fall before him.
While they were still talking with him, the king’s officials came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
So the king and Haman went to feast with Queen Esther.
And on the second day, at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? It shall be done, even to half the kingdom.
Then Queen Esther answered and said, If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.
For we have been sold, my people and I, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed. Had we been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent, although the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss.
So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?
And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this evil Haman! Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
Then the king arose from the the banquet of wine in his wrath and went into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, to request for his soul, for he perceived that evil was determined against him by the king.
When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, Will he also violate the queen while I am in the house? As the word left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
Now Harbonah, one of the officials, said to the king, Behold, the gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke good on the king’s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him on it!
So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was pacified.
On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the one harassing the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.
And the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.
And Esther spoke again to the king, falling down at his feet, and implored him with tears to take away the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the plans which he had devised against the Jews.
And the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,
and said, If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor before him and the thing seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to exterminate the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.
For how can I endure to see the evil that will meet my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he has stretched out his hand against the Jews.
You yourselves write a decree concerning the Jews, as is good in your eyes, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring no one can revoke.
So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the rulers of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all, to every province in its own writing, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own writing and language.
And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed it with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds.
By these letters the king permitted the Jews who were in every city to gather together and take their stand for their souls; to exterminate, kill, and destroy all the forces of any people or province that would be hostile to them, even little children and women, and to plunder their possessions,
on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.
A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the palace.
So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of violet and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor.
And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews, because fear of the Jews fell upon them.
Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, the time came for the king’s command and his decree to be executed. On the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, the opposite occurred, in that the Jews themselves overpowered those who hated them.
The Jews gathered together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to lay hands on those who sought their harm. And no one could withstand them, because fear of them fell upon all the people.
And all the rulers of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and all those doing the king’s work, helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for this man Mordecai proceeded on into greatness.
Thus the Jews struck down all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, with slaughter and destruction, and did what they pleased with those who hated them.
And in Shushan the palace the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
Also Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha;
the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews; they killed; but they did not lay a hand on the spoils.
On that day the number of those who were killed in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
And the king said to Queen Esther, The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. Or what is your further request? It shall be done.
Then Esther said, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do again tomorrow according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.
So the king commanded this to be done; the decree was issued in Shushan, and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered together again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men at Shushan; but they did not lay a hand on the spoils.
The remainder of the Jews in the king’s provinces gathered together and took a stand for their souls, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of their enemies; but they did not lay a hand on the spoils.
This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. And on the fourteenth day of the month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
But the Jews who were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day, as well as on the fourteenth; and on the fifteenth of the month they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
Therefore the Jews of the villages who dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of gladness and feasting, as a good day, and for sending portions to one another.
And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters to all the Jews, near and far, who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus,
to establish among them that they should celebrate yearly the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar,
as the days on which the Jews had rest from their enemies, as the month which was turned from sorrow to joy for them, and from mourning to a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and joy, of sending portions to one another and gifts to the needy.
So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them,
because Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to exterminate them, and had cast Pur (that is, the lot), to destroy them and to exterminate them;
but when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letter that this evil plot which Haman had devised against the Jews should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name Pur. Therefore, because of all the words of this letter, what they had seen concerning this matter, and what had happened to them,
the Jews established and took it upon themselves and their seed and all who would join them, that without fail they should celebrate these two days year after year, according to the writing and according to the appointed time;
that these days should be remembered and kept from generation to generation, by every family, in every province and every city, that these days of Purim should not pass away among the Jews, and that the memory of them should not cease among their seed.
Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.
And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the one hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
to confirm these days of Purim at their appointed time, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them, and as they had decreed for themselves and their seed, concerning the matters of their fasting and of their cry.
So the decree of Esther confirmed these matters about Purim, and it was written in the book.
And King Ahasuerus imposed a tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea.
Now all the acts of his authority and his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia.
For Mordecai the Jew was second to King Ahasuerus, and was great among the Jews and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the welfare of his people and speaking peace to all his seed.
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and the man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God and turned away from evil.
And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.
And his sons went and prepared feasts in their houses, each on his appointed day, and sent and invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
So it was, when the days of feasting had made the rounds, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did over time.
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them.
And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.
Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?
So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?
Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have flourished in the land.
However, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and will he not curse You to Your face!
And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand upon him. So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah.
Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brother’s house;
and a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
when the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands, rushed in upon the camels and took them away, yea, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!
While he was still speaking, another also came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brother’s house,
and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!
Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell down upon the ground and prostrated himself;
and he said: Naked I have come from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away; blessed is the name of Jehovah.
In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.
Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to swallow him up without cause.
So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Yea, all that a man has he will give for his soul.
But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face!
And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand, but keep his soul alive.
So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah, and struck Job with malignant inflammation from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.
And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself; and he sat down in the middle of the ashes.
Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!
But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. Shall we indeed receive good from God, and shall we not accept adversity? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and show sympathy for him, and to comfort him.
And when they lifted up their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the heavens.
So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.
And Job answered, and said:
Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, A male child has been conceived.
Let that day be darkness; let God above not inquire after it, nor the light shine upon it.
Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud settle on it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
As for that night, let darkness take it away; let it not rejoice among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
Lo, let that night be barren! Let no joyful shout come into it!
Let those curse it who curse the day, those who are ready to stir up Leviathan.
Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none, and not see the eyelids of the dawn;
because it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.
Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not expire when I came forth from the belly?
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?
For now I would have lain down and been quiet, I would have slept; then I would have been at rest
with kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
Or why was I not concealed like a miscarriage, like infants who never saw the light?
There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
There the prisoners are at ease together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
The small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
who long for death, but it does not come, and search for it more than hidden treasures;
who are joyful with exultation, and are glad when they meet the grave;
or to a man whose way is concealed, whom God has covered?
For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings pour out like waters.
For the thing I had dreaded with terror has come upon me, and what I had feared has come to me.
I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for turmoil came.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can restrain words?
Surely you have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands.
Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.
But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; it touches you, and you are dismayed.
Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?
Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off?
Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
By the breath of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.
The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.
The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
Now a word was brought to me by stealth, and my ear received a whisper of it.
In the uncertainties from the visions of the night, when a man falls into deep sleep,
fear and trembling befell me, which made all my bones dread.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair on my flesh stood up.
It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes in silence; then I heard a voice saying:
Is mortal man more righteous than God? Is a strong man more pure than his Maker?
Behold He puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error;
even more so those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the grass!
They are crushed from morning till evening; they perish forever, with no one regarding.
Is not their own excellence within them removed? They die, even without wisdom.
Call out now. Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn?
For anger kills a foolish man, and jealousy slays a simple one.
I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.
His sons are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to rescue them.
The hungry eat up his harvest, taking it even from the thorns, and a snare snatches their wealth.
For affliction does not come forth from the dust, nor does trouble spring up out of the ground;
yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
But indeed, I would seek the Mighty God, and before God I would lay out my case;
who does great things, and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:
He gives rain upon the face of the earth, and sends waters abroad;
He sets the lowly on high, and those who mourn are exalted to safety;
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot bring about their success;
He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the twisted is precipitated.
They meet with darkness by day, and grope at midday as in the night.
But He saves the needy from the sword, from the mouth of the mighty, and from their hand.
So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
Behold, blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
For He bruises, but He binds up; He shatters, but His hands heal.
He will deliver you in six troubles; yea, in seven no evil shall touch you:
In famine He shall redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you shall not be afraid of devastation when it comes.
You shall laugh at devastation and famine, and you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.
You shall know that your tent is in peace; you shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.
You shall also know that your seed shall be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth.
You shall come to the grave in full vigor, as a sheaf of grain springs up in its season.
Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear and know it for yourself.
Then Job answered and said:
Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, and my calamity laid with it on the scales!
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
Does the wild ass bray when it has grass, or does the ox low over its fodder?
Can something tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
My soul refuses to touch them; they are as sickening food.
Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant me the thing that I long for;
that it would please God to crush me, that He would loose His hand and cut me off!
Then I would still have comfort; though in anguish, I would leap for joy; let Him not spare; for I have not hidden the Words of the Holy One.
What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?
Is my help not within me? And is wisdom driven from me?
To him who is despairing, kindness should be shown by his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
My brothers have dealt deceitfully. Like a brook, like the streams of the brooks, they pass away;
which are dark because of the ice, and into which the snow vanishes.
When it is warm, they stop flowing; when it is hot, they dry up from their place.
The paths of their journey are winding; they go into nothingness and vanish.
The wanderers of Tema have paid attention; the travelers of Sheba have looked for them.
They are disappointed because they had been confident, but when they had come there they were abashed.
Surely now you are nothing; you see terror and are afraid.
Did I ever say, Bring something to me? Or, Offer a bribe for me from your wealth?
Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
Teach me, and I will keep silent; cause me to understand in what way I have erred.
Right words are grievous, but what does your rebuke prove?
Do you intend to rebuke the words and the speeches of one in despair, as wind?
Yea, you throw down the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend.
Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; for my face will tell if I am lying.
Turn back, let there be no injustice! Yea, turn back; my righteousness still stands!
Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?
Is there not warfare for man on earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?
Like a servant who pants for the shade, and like a hired man who waits eagerly for his wages,
so I have been allotted months of futility, and restless nights have been appointed to me.
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise from the long night? For I have had my fill of tossing until the twilight of the dawn.
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods, my skin is hardened and cracked and oozes.
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are used up without hope.
O remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never return to see good.
The eye of him who sees me shall watch me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I am not.
As the cloud vanishes and goes away, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.
He shall never again return to his house, nor shall his place know him anymore.
Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the distress of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
Am I a sea, or a sea serpent, that You set a guard over me?
When I say, My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,
then You scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than my body.
I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are but a breath.
What is man, that You should magnify him, that You should set Your heart upon him,
that You should visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
How long will You not look away from me, and let me alone until I swallow my spittle?
Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O Watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, so that I am a burden to myself?
Why then do You not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, and You shall seek me diligently, but I will no longer be.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
How long will you speak these things, and the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?
Does the Mighty God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?
If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression.
If you would earnestly seek the Mighty God and make your supplication to the Almighty,
if you were pure and upright, surely now He would awake for you, and would have restored your righteous abode.
Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would increase abundantly.
For inquire now of the former generation, and prepare to search the fathers;
for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.
Shall they not teach you and tell you, and utter words from their heart?
Can the rush grow up without a marsh? Can the reeds grow without water?
While it is yet green and not cut down, it dries up before any other plant.
So are the paths of all who forget the Mighty God; and the hope of the ungodly shall perish,
whose confidence shall be cut off, and whose trust as a spider’s house.
He leans on his house, but it does not stand. He holds it fast, but it does not endure.
He is moist before the sun, and his shoots spread out in his garden.
His roots are wrapped around a heap; he sees a house of stones.
If he is swallowed up from his place, then it will deny him, saying, I have not seen you.
Behold, this is the joy of His way, and out of the earth others shall grow.
Behold, the Mighty God will not cast away the perfect, nor will His hand support evildoers.
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with rejoicing.
Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will come to nothing.
Then Job answered and said:
Truly I know it is so; but how can a man be just before the Mighty God?
If one wished to contend with Him, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
He is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against Him and been at peace?
He removes the mountains, and they do not know when He overturns them in His anger;
He shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;
He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals up the stars;
He alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea;
He made the Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;
He does great things past finding out, yea, wonders without number.
If He passes by me, I do not see Him; if He moves past, I do not perceive Him.
If He takes away, who can repulse Him? Who can say to Him, What are You doing?
The Mighty God will not withdraw His anger; those who help the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.
How then can I answer Him, and choose my words before Him?
For though I had been righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge.
If I had called and He answered me, I would not believe that He had heard the voice of my prayer.
For He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.
He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.
If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong; and if of justice, who will appoint my meeting?
Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; though I were perfect, it would prove me perverse.
Though I were perfect, yet I do not know my soul; I despise my life.
It is all one; therefore I have said, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.
If the scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the despair of the innocent.
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?
Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.
They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its food.
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,
I am afraid of all my pain; I know that You will not hold me innocent.
If I am guilty, why then do I labor in vain?
If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap,
yet You will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes would abhor me.
For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him, and that we should come together in judgment.
Nor is there any mediator between us, who may lay his hand on us both.
Let Him take His rod away from me, and do not let the dread of Him terrify me.
Then I would speak and not fear Him; but it is not so with me.
My soul loathes my life; I will leave behind my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why You contend with me.
Has it been delightful to You that You oppress, that You despise the work of Your hands, and have shone on the counsel of the wicked?
Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees?
Are Your days like the days of mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,
that You should seek out my iniquity and search out my sin,
although You know that I am not wicked, and there is no one who can rescue out of Your hand?
Your hands have made me and fashioned me together all around; yet You swallow me up.
Remember, I beseech You, that You have made me like clay. And will You bring me back and return me to dust?
Did you not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese?
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.
You have granted me life and favor, and Your care has preserved my spirit.
And these things You have hidden in Your heart; I have known that this was with You.
If I have sinned, then You have kept watch over me, and will not acquit me of my iniquity.
If I have been wicked, woe to me! And if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head; I am full of disgrace. Pay attention to my affliction!
If I am exalted, You hunt me like a lion, and return to show Yourself wondrously to me.
You renew Your witnesses against me, and increase Your indignation toward me; changes and war are with me.
Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had expired and no eye had seen me!
I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.
Are not my days few? Then cease and leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort
before I go and not return; to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
a land of darkness and gloom, as the shadow of death, without any order; where it shines as darkness.
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man giving lip be justified?
Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one make you ashamed?
For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in Your eyes.
But oh that God would speak, and open His lips against you,
that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your wisdom. Know therefore that God forgets some of your iniquity.
Can you search and find out God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?
They are higher than the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?
Their measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers together, then who can repulse Him?
For He knows the vanity of men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?
For an empty-headed man will be wise, when a wild ass’s colt is born a man.
If you have prepared your heart, and spread out your hands toward Him;
if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tents.
Then surely you shall lift up your face without blemish; yea, you shall be steadfast, and not fear;
because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that have passed away,
and your lifetime shall arise more than the brightness of the noonday. Though you were dark, you shall be like the morning.
And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yea, you shall dig around you, and rest in safety.
You shall also lie down, and no one shall cause you to tremble; yea, many shall entreat your favor.
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and their place of escape shall perish; and their hope, as the expiring of the soul!
Then Job answered and said:
Truly you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!
But I have a heart as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not know such things as these?
I am one as a laughingstock to his friends; one who called upon God, and He answered him; the just and whole one is a laughingstock.
A lamp is despised in the thoughts of one who is at ease; it is made ready for those whose feet slip.
The tents of plunderers prosper, and those who provoke the Mighty God are secure, as God brings into his hand.
But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; and the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you;
or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea shall recount to you.
Who among all these does not know that the hand of Jehovah has done this,
in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all the flesh of mankind?
Does not the ear test words and the mouth taste its food?
Wisdom is with old men, and with length of days is understanding.
With Him are wisdom and strength, He has counsel and understanding.
Behold, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt; He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
Behold, He withholds the waters, and they dry up; He sends them out, and they transform the earth.
With Him are strength and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His.
He causes counselors to walk away barefoot, and makes fools of the judges.
He loosens the bonds of kings, and binds their loins with a waistband.
He causes the priests to walk away barefoot, and overthrows the mighty.
He removes the lips of the trusted ones, and takes away the discretion of the elders.
He pours contempt upon nobles, and drops the girdle off hollow bones.
He reveals deep dark mysteries, and brings out the deep darkness into the light of day.
He makes nations great, and destroys them; He spreads out nations, and guides them.
He takes away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth, and makes them wander in a wilderness with no path.
They grope in the darkness without light, and He makes them stagger like a drunkard.
Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with the Mighty God.
But you smear lies; you are all worthless physicians.
O that you would be silent and stop talking, and it would be your wisdom!
Now listen to my arguments, and pay attention to the complaint of my lips.
Will you speak unjustly for the Mighty God, and talk deceitfully for Him?
Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for the Mighty God?
Will it be well when He searches you out? Or do you mock Him as one mocks a man?
He will surely rebuke you if you secretly show partiality.
Will not His loftiness make you afraid, and the dread of Him fall upon you?
Your remembered proverbs are worthless; your backs are backs of clay.
Keep quiet, let me be, that I may speak; then let pass over me what will!
Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soul in my hands?
Though He slay me, yet will I wait for Him; but I will prove my own ways before Him.
He also is my salvation, for a hypocrite can not come before Him.
Listen and pay attention to my speech; to my declaration with your ears.
Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified.
Who is he who will contend with me? For if I am silent, I will die.
Only two things do not do to me, O God, then I will not hide myself from Your face:
Remove Your hand far from me, and let not the dread of You make me afraid.
Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and You respond to me.
How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin.
Why do You hide Your face, and regard me as Your enemy?
Will You terrify a leaf driven to and fro? And will You pursue dry stubble?
For You write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
You put my feet in the stocks, and watch all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet;
worn out like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
Man who is born of woman is of few days, and full of turmoil.
He comes forth like a flower and is cut off; he flees like a shadow and does not remain.
And do You open Your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with Yourself?
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one!
Since his days are determined, the number of his months is with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass beyond it.
Look away from him that he may rest, so like a hired man he may be satisfied with his day.
For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not cease.
Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,
yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant.
But a strong man dies and is laid away; indeed man expires and where is he?
As water evaporates from the sea, and a river wastes away and dries up,
so man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake nor be aroused from their sleep.
O that You would hide me in Sheol, that You would conceal me until Your wrath is turned back, that You would appoint me a decree, and remember me!
If a man dies, shall he revive? All the days of my service I will wait, until my change comes.
You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall long for the work of Your hands.
For now You number my steps. Do you not watch over my sin?
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You cover my iniquity.
But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, and as a rock is moved out of its place;
as waters wear away stones, and as floods wash away the dust of the earth; so You destroy the hope of man.
You overpower him forever, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.
His sons come to honor, and he does not recognize them; they are diminished, and he does not perceive it.
But his flesh will be in pain, and his soul will mourn.
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
Should he reason with speech that is not useful, or with words which do not profit?
Yea, you cast off fear, and restrain meditation before the Mighty God.
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; yea, your own lips testify against you.
Are you the first man who was born? Or were you made before the hills?
Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not in us?
Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us, much older than your father.
Are the consolations of the Mighty God of little worth to you? Do you have secret words?
Why does your heart carry you away, and what do your eyes wink at,
that you turn your spirit against the Mighty God, and let such words go out of your mouth?
What is man, that he should be pure? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
If God puts no trust in His saints, and the heavens are not pure in His sight;
how much more abhorrent and corrupt is man, who drinks injustice like water!
I will tell you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare,
what wise men have told, not hiding anything received from their fathers,
to whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them:
The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, and the number of years is stored up for the ruthless.
Dreadful sounds are in his ears; during peace, devastation comes upon him.
He does not believe that he will return from darkness, for a sword watches for him.
He wanders about for bread, saying, where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.
Adversity and distress terrify him; they overpower him, like a king ready for the attack.
For he stretches out his hand against the Mighty God, and acts defiantly against the Almighty,
running with stiff neck against Him with his thick, embossed shield.
He has covered his face with his fatness, and made his waist heavy with fat.
He dwells in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.
He will not be rich, nor will his wealth endure, nor shall his possessions overspread the earth.
He shall not depart from darkness; the flame shall dry out his branches, and by the breath of His mouth he shall be removed.
Let not him who wanders about trust in vanity, for vanity shall be his recompense.
It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive.
For the company of hypocrites shall be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.
They conceive trouble and bring forth iniquity; their womb prepares deceit.
Then Job answered and said:
I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all!
Is there no end to windy words? What ails you that you answer thus?
I also could speak as you do, if your soul were in the place of my soul. I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.
But I would assure you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would be restrained.
When I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I remain silent, how do I proceed?
But now He has exhausted me; you have devastated my company.
You have seized me as a witness; my deception rises up against me and testifies to my face.
He tears me in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; my adversary sharpens His eyes at me.
They have gaped at me with their mouth, and struck me reproachfully on the cheek; they gather together against me.
The Mighty God has delivered me to the perverse, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken hold on my neck, and dashed me to pieces; He has set me up for His target.
His archers surround me; He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground.
He breaks me with break upon break; He runs at me like a mighty man.
I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and have thrust my horn into the dust.
My face is flushed from weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
although no violence is in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
O earth, do not cover my blood, and let my cry have no resting place!
Even now, behold, my evidence is in Heaven, and my witness is on high.
My friends scorn me; my eyes pour out tears to God.
Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for the son of his friend!
For when the number of years have come, I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, the grave is ready for me.
Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their rebellion?
Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who is he who will strike hands with me?
For You have hidden their heart from understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.
He who speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
But He has made me a byword of the people, and I have become one in whose face men spit.
My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, and all my members are like shadows.
Upright men are astonished at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite.
Yet the righteous will take hold on his way, and he who has clean hands shall increase strength.
But please, return and come back, all of you, for I do not find one wise man among you.
My days have past, my plans have been torn apart, even the thoughts of my heart.
They set the night for day. The light is near, they say, in the face of darkness.
If I wait for the grave as my house, if I make my bed in the darkness;
if I have said to corruption, You are my father, and to the worm, You are my mother and my sister;
where then is my hope? As for my hope, who shall see it?
They shall go down to the gates of Sheol; we shall have rest together in the dust.
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
How long till you put an end to words? Consider, and afterward we will speak.
Why are we counted as beasts, and considered vile in your eyes?
You who tear yourself in anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place?
The light of the wicked shall be extinguished, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.
The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp beside him shall be extinguished.
The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks into a netting.
The snare takes him by the heel, and the noose takes hold of him.
A rope is hidden for him on the ground, and a trap for him in the path.
Terrors frighten him on every side, and have scattered him to his feet.
His strength is starved, and calamity is ready at his side.
It devours parts of his skin; the firstborn of death devours parts of his body.
He is drawn out of the security of his tent, and marched before the king of terrors.
What is not his dwells in his tent; brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.
His roots are dried up below, and his branch above is cut off.
The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name on the face of the street.
He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
He has neither offspring nor posterity among his people, nor any survivors in his dwellings.
Those in the west are astonished at his day, and those in the east are seized with horror.
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him who does not know the Mighty God.
Then Job answered and said:
How long will you torment my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you have wronged me.
And if indeed I have erred, my error remains with me.
If indeed you magnify yourselves against me, and adjudge my reproach against me,
know then that God has bowed me, and has surrounded me with His net.
Behold, I cry out concerning injustice, but I am not heard. I cry aloud, but there is no justice.
He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; and He has set darkness in my paths.
He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope He has uprooted like a tree.
He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His enemies.
His troops come together and build up their road against me; they encamp all around my tent.
He has removed my brothers far from me, and my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
My relatives have left, and my close friends have forgotten me.
Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their eyes.
I have called my servant, but he does not answer; I implored him with my mouth.
My breath is loathsome to my wife, and I must entreat the favor of children for the sake of my own body.
Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me.
My circle of friends have abhorred me, and those whom I have loved have turned against me.
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends! For the hand of God has struck me!
Why do you persecute me as the Mighty God does, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
Oh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!
That they were forever engraved on a rock with an iron pen and lead!
For I know that my Redeemer is alive, and He shall stand at the latter time upon the earth;
and after my skin has been struck off from my flesh, I shall see God:
Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not a stranger. O how my reins have been exhausted within me!
If you should say, How shall we persecute him? since the root of the matter has been found in me,
fear for yourselves because of the sword; for wrath brings the punishment of the sword; that you may know there is judgment.
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
Therefore my uncertain thoughts make me answer, because of the anxiety within me.
I have heard the admonition against my reproaches, but the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.
Do you not know this from of old, ever since man was placed upon earth,
that the rejoicing of the wicked is near its end, and the mirth of the hypocrite is but for a moment?
Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, and his head reaches to the clouds,
yet he shall perish forever like his own dung; those who see him shall say, where is he?
He shall fly away like a dream, and not be found; yea, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.
The eye that has seen him shall see him no more, nor will his place regard him anymore.
His children shall seek the favor of the poor, and his hands shall return his wealth.
His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.
Though evil is sweet in his mouth, and he hides it under his tongue,
though he spares it and does not forsake it, but still keeps it in his mouth,
yet his food in his stomach has churned up; it is serpent’s venom within him.
He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; the Mighty God casts them out of his belly.
He shall suck the poison of serpents; the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
He shall not see the streams, the rivers of honey and curds.
He shall give back that for which he labored, and shall not swallow it down; He shall have no enjoyment from the exchanges of his wealth.
For he has crushed and forsaken the poor, he has seized a house which he did not build.
Surely he has known no ease in his belly; he shall not save anything he desires.
No food is left for him; there is no travail after his well-being.
In the fullness of his scorn he shall be in distress; every hand of trouble shall come against him.
When he is about to fill his stomach, God will cast upon him the fury of His wrath, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
If he flees from the iron weapon, a bronze bow shall pierce him through.
It has been drawn, and comes out the back; yea, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors come upon him;
total darkness is his hidden treasure. An unfanned fire shall devour him; and any survivors in his tent shall tremble.
The heavens shall lay bare his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.
The fruit of his house shall be removed, being poured out in the day of His wrath.
This is the portion from God for a wicked man, the heritage promised to him by the Mighty God.
Then Job answered and said:
Listen carefully to my speech, and let this be your consolation.
Bear with me that I may speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.
As for me, is my complaint against man? And if it were, why should my spirit not be impatient?
Look at me and be astonished; put your hand over your mouth.
Even when I remember I am terrified, and trembling takes hold of my flesh.
Why do the wicked live and become old, yea, and become mighty in power?
Their seed is established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.
Their houses are at peace, without dread; neither is the rod of God upon them.
Their bull has bred without failure; their cow calves and does not miscarry.
They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice to the sound of the flute.
They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to Sheol.
Yet they say to the Mighty God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we entreat Him?
Behold, their goodness is not in their hand! The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
How often is the lamp of the wicked put out! How often does their calamity come upon them, the sorrows God distributes in His anger!
They are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that a storm steals away.
God treasures up one’s iniquity for his children. He recompenses him, that he may know it.
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
For what is his delight in his house after him, when the number of his months has been cut off?
Can anyone teach the Mighty God knowledge, since He judges those that are on high?
One dies in his full strength, being wholly secure and at ease;
his pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moist.
Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, never having eaten with pleasure.
They lie down together in the dust, and worms cover them.
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the plots with which you would do me wrong.
For you say, Where is the house of the noble one? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wicked?
Have you not asked those who pass along the road? And do you not know their trademarks?
For the wicked are reserved for the day of calamity; they shall be brought out on the day of wrath.
Who declares his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done?
Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and a vigil kept over the tomb.
The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; everyone shall drag along after him, as countless ones before him.
How then do you comfort me with vanity, since treachery remains in your answers?
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
Can a man be of use to the Mighty God, as he who is wise may be profitable to himself?
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?
Is it because of your reverence that He corrects you, and enters into judgment with you?
Is not your wickedness great, and your iniquities without end?
For you have taken a pledge from your brother for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
You have not given the weary water to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.
But the man of strength possesses the land, and the honorable man dwells in it.
You have sent widows away empty, and crushed the arms of the fatherless.
Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden dread terrifies you;
or darkness so that you cannot see; and an abundance of water covers you.
Is not God in the height of the heavens? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!
And you say, What does the Mighty God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness?
Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, and He walks above the circle of the heavens.
Will you keep to the old way which wicked men have trod,
who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out by the flood?
They said to the Mighty God, Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?
Yet He filled their houses with good things. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
The righteous see it and are glad, and the innocent have them in derision:
Surely, are not our adversaries cut down; and the fire consumes their remnant.
Now be useful to Him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come to you.
Receive, now, the Law from His mouth, and lay up His Words in your heart.
If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up; you shall remove injustice far from your tents.
Then you shall lay up your gold as the dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
Yea, the Almighty will be your gold and your esteemed silver;
for then you shall have your delight in the Almighty, and lift up your face unto God.
You shall make your supplication to Him, He will hear you, and you shall make good your vows.
You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be confirmed for you; and light shall shine on your ways.
When you have been made low, then you will say in your heart, It was pride. Then He will save the lowly of eyes.
He will deliver one who is not innocent; yea, he will deliver by the purity of your hands.
Then Job answered and said:
Even today my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy over my groaning.
Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come to His place!
I would present my case before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me.
Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would set me in place.
There the upright could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
Behold, I go forward, but He is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive Him;
when He works on the left hand, I cannot see Him; when He turns to the right hand, I cannot perceive Him.
But He knows the way that I take; when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.
I have not departed from the Commandment of His lips; I have treasured the Words of His mouth more than my prescribed food.
But He is One, and who can turn Him back? And whatever His soul desires, that He does.
For He completes what is prescribed for me, and many such things are with Him.
Therefore I am terrified at His presence; when I consider this, I am in dread of Him.
For the Mighty God has made my heart weak, and the Almighty has terrified me.
But I have not been cut off by the face of darkness, and He has concealed the deep darkness from my face.
Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, why do those who know Him not see His days?
Some remove landmarks; they seize flocks and feed on them;
they drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow’s ox as a pledge.
They thrust away the needy out of the road; the poor of the land have been forced into hiding together.
Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, they go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness yields food for them and for their young.
They gather their fodder in the field and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
They lodge the naked without clothing, with no covering against the cold.
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and hug the rock for want of shelter.
They seize the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor.
They cause them to go naked, without clothing; and they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
They press out oil within their walls, and tread winepresses, but are thirsty.
Men groan from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out; yet God does not charge them with folly.
They rebel against the Light; they have not recognized its ways nor stayed in its paths.
The murderer rises at daylight; he kills the poor and needy; and in the night he is like a thief.
The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and puts a covering over his face.
In the dark they dig through into houses which they have marked for themselves by day; they do not know the light.
For the morning is the same to them as deep darkness; they know the terrors of deep darkness.
They are swift on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; they do not turn into the way of the vineyards.
As drought and heat consume the snow waters, so Sheol consumes those who have sinned.
The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be remembered no more, and injustice shall be broken like a tree.
He mistreats the barren who do not bear, and does no good to the widow.
He also draws the mighty away with his strength; he rises up, but no one is sure of life.
He gives them security, and they trust in it; yet His eyes are on their ways.
They are exalted for a little while, then they are gone. They are brought low; they are all drawn together out of the way, and cut off like heads of grain.
And if it is not so, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech worth nothing?
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
Dominion and fear belong to Him; He makes peace in His high places.
Is there any numbering of His armies? Upon whom does His light not rise?
How then can man be just before the Mighty God? Or how can one be pure who is born of a woman?
If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight;
how much less man, who is a maggot; and the son of man, who is a worm!
But Job answered and said:
How have you helped him who is without power? How have you saved the arm that has no strength?
How have you counseled one who has no wisdom, or widely declared sound wisdom?
To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you?
The spirits of the dead wait anxiously under the waters, and those inhabiting them.
Sheol is naked before Him, and Abaddon has no covering.
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing.
He binds up the waters in His thick clouds, yet the clouds are not split open under them.
He covers the face of His throne, and spreads His cloud over it.
He has encircled a boundary for the face of the waters at the edge of light and darkness.
The pillars of heaven tremble, and are astonished at His rebuke.
He has stirred up the sea with His power, and by His understanding has shattered the arrogant.
By His Spirit He has made the heavens beautiful; His hand has brought forth the fleeing serpent.
Lo, these are the extremities of His ways; yea, what a whisper of a word has been heard of Him! But the thunder of His might who can understand?
Moreover Job continued on with his discourse, and said:
As the Mighty God lives, who has taken away my justice, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,
my lips will not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
Far be it from me that I should say you are right. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.
I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach any of my days.
Let my enemy be like the wicked, and he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.
For what is the hope of the hypocrite when he is cut off, when God draws out his soul?
Will the Mighty God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?
Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?
I will teach you about the hand of the Mighty God; that which is with the Almighty I will not hide.
Behold, all of you have seen it. Why then are you vain like a vapor?
This is the portion of a wicked man with the Mighty God, and the heritage of the ruthless, received from the Almighty:
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
Those who survive him shall be buried in death, and their widows shall not weep,
though he heaps up silver like dust, and provides clothing like clay;
he may provide it, but the just shall wear it, and the innocent shall divide up the silver.
He builds his house like a moth, like a booth which a watchman makes.
The rich man shall lie down, but not be gathered up; he has opened his eyes, and is not.
Terrors overtake him like waters; a tempest steals him away in the night.
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it whirls him out of his place.
It casts him out without pity; he hastens to flee from its hand.
Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
Surely there is a source for silver, and a place where gold is refined.
Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from stone.
Man puts an end to darkness, and searches every recess for stone in the gloom and deep darkness.
The torrent breaks out far from the sojourners; forgotten by the feet of men, they hang and swing to and fro.
As for the earth, from it comes bread, but underneath it is churned up like fire;
its stones are the source of sapphires, and it contains gold dust.
It is a path no bird knows, nor has the falcon’s eye caught sight of it.
The young of the majestic beasts have not trodden it, nor has the lion passed by it.
He has put his hand on the rock; He has overturned the mountains by the roots.
He cuts out streams in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing.
He has bound up the streams from flowing; He brings what is hidden out into the light.
But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
Man does not know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.
The deep says, It is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me.
It cannot be given for gold, nor can silver be weighed for its price.
It cannot be weighed against the gold of Ophir, the precious onyx or sapphire.
Neither gold nor crystal can be compared to it, nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
No mention shall be made of coral or crystal, for the acquiring of wisdom is above precious stones.
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot be compared to it, nor can it be weighed out for pure gold.
From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding?
It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the birds of the heavens.
Abaddon and Death say, We have heard a report of it with our ears.
God understands its way, and He knows its place.
For He looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heavens,
to appoint a weight for the wind, and mete out the waters by measure.
When He made a decree for the rain, and a path for the thunderbolt,
then He saw and declared it; He prepared it, yea, He searched it out.
And to man He said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.
Moreover Job continued on with his discourse, and said:
Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when God watched over me;
when His lamp shone upon my head, and when by His light I walked through darkness;
just as I was in my productive days, when the counsel of God was over my tent;
when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were around me;
when my steps were bathed in butter, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me;
when I went out to the gate through the city, when I set up my seat in the open square.
The young men saw me and hid, and the aged arose and stood up;
the rulers refrained from talking, and put their hand on their mouth;
the leaders hid their voice, and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth.
When the ear heard, it blessed me, and when the eye saw, it bore witness to me;
because I delivered the poor who cried out, the fatherless and the one who had no one to help him.
The blessing of the dying man came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the case that I did not know.
I broke the fangs of the perverse, and flung out the prey from his teeth.
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days as the sand.
My root was open to the waters, and the dew lay all night on my branch.
My glory was fresh within me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
Men listened to me and waited, and kept silent for my counsel.
After my speech they did not change anything, and my words dropped upon them.
They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.
I laughed at them when they did not believe it, and did not allow the light of my countenance to fall.
I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; so I dwelt as a king among the troops, as one who comforts mourners.
But now they mock at me, men younger than I, whose fathers I have refused to put with the dogs of my flock.
Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished.
They are gaunt from want and famine, gnawing the dry ground recently made desolate and waste;
who pluck mallow by the bushes, and broom tree roots for their food.
They were driven out from the midst; they shouted at them as against a thief;
to dwell in the ravines of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and the rocks.
Among the bushes they brayed, under the nettles they huddled.
They were sons of fools, yea, sons without a name; they were scourged from the land.
And now I am their taunting song; yea, I am their byword.
They abhor me, they keep far from me; they do not refrain from spitting in my face.
Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint before me.
At my right hand the brood arises; they push away my feet, and they raise against me their ways of destruction.
They have broken up my path, they profit from my calamity; they have no helper.
They come as broad breakers; under the devastation they roll along.
Terrors are turned upon me; they pursue my honor as the wind, and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud.
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction take hold of me.
My bones are pierced in me at night, and my gnawing pains take no rest.
By great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about as the collar of my coat.
He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You pay no attention to me.
But You have changed to be cruel to me; with the strength of Your hand You oppose me.
You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it; You dissipate me in the storm.
For I know that You will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins. Behold, they cry out for help when He destroys it.
Have I not wept for him who had a hard day? Has not my soul grieved for the needy?
But when I looked for good, evil came; and when I waited for light, then came darkness.
My stomach has been upset and is not still; days of affliction have confronted me.
I have walked about in the dark, not in the sun; I have stood up in the assembly and cried out for help.
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to the daughters of the owl.
My skin has grown black on me; my bones are burned with dryness.
My harp is turned to mourning, and my flute into the voice of those who weep.
I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look intently upon a virgin?
For what is the portion from God above, and the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
Is it not destruction for the wicked, and calamity for the workers of iniquity?
Does He not see my ways, and count all my steps?
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
let me be weighed on just scales, that God may know my integrity.
If my step has turned aside from the way, or my heart walked after my eyes, or if any blemish has clung to my hands,
then let me sow, and another eat; yea, let my harvest be rooted out.
If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,
then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down over her.
For that would be wickedness; yea, it would be perversity deserving of judgment.
For that would be a fire that devours to Abaddon, and would root out all my increase.
If I despised the cause of my male or female servant when they have a dispute with me,
what then shall I do when the Mighty God rises up? When He reviews my case, what shall I answer Him?
Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?
If I have withheld from the poor their desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
or eaten my morsel by myself, and the fatherless has not eaten of it
(when from my youth, as a father I have raised him, and from my mother’s womb I guided her);
if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or any poor man without covering;
if his heart has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
if I have waved my hand against the fatherless, when I was looking after my help in the gate;
then let my shoulder fall from my back, and let my arm be broken from the joint.
For calamity from the Mighty God is a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not do such things.
If I have made gold my hope, or said to fine gold, you are my confidence;
if I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had acquired much;
if I have observed the sun when it shines, or the moon moving in splendor,
so that my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand;
this also would be a perversity deserving of judgment, for I would have denied the Mighty God above.
If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or been excited when evil found him
(indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin, to request a curse upon his soul);
if the men of my tent have not said, who is there that is not satisfied with his flesh?
(no sojourner had to pass the night in the street, for I have opened my doors to the traveler);
if I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom,
then let me fear the great multitude, and let the contempt of families terrify me, and I will keep silent and not go out of the door.
Oh, that I had one to hear me! Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me, that the man complaining had written an indictment!
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, and bind it on me like a crown;
I would declare to Him the number of my steps; like a prince I would approach Him.
If my land cries out against me, or its furrows weep together;
if I have eaten its produce without money, or caused its owners to expire their souls;
then let thistles come forth instead of wheat, and weeds instead of barley. The words of Job are finished.
So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job; his wrath was kindled because he was justifying his soul more than God.
Also against his three friends his wrath was kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited for Job, to speak.
So when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled.
And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: I am young in years, and you are very old; therefore I have shrunk back, and out of respect for you, have not told my opinion.
I said, Age should speak, and multitude of years should declare wisdom.
But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.
Great men are not always wise, nor do the aged always discern justice.
Therefore I have said, Listen to me; I also will declare my opinion.
Behold, I waited for your speech, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out words.
Yea, I paid attention to you, and behold, not one of you proved Job wrong, nor answered his words;
lest you should say, We have found wisdom; the Mighty God will drive him out, not man.
Now he has not directed his words against me; so I will not answer him with your words.
They have been dismayed and answer no more; they have left off speaking.
And I have waited, because they did not speak, because they have stood still and answered no more.
I also will answer my share, I too will declare my opinion.
For I am full of words; the spirit within me has compelled me.
Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; it is about to split open like new wineskins.
I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer.
I will not show partiality to anyone, nor will I flatter any man.
For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.
But please, Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.
Behold, now I have opened my mouth; my tongue has spoken in my mouth.
My words come from my upright heart; my lips shall utter knowledge in purity.
The Spirit of the Mighty God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
If you are able, answer me, set your words in order before me; take your stand.
Behold, I am as your spokesman before the Mighty God; I also have been formed out of clay.
Surely no fear of me will terrify you, nor shall my burden be heavy upon you.
Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words, saying,
I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me.
Yet He finds opposition in me, He counts me as His enemy;
He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.
Behold, in this you have not been righteous. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give account to you of His business.
For the Mighty God may speak once or twice, yet no one regards it.
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, while slumbering on their beds,
then He opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction.
In order to turn man from his deed, and conceal pride from man,
He keeps back his soul from the Pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, and with perpetual strife in his bones,
so that his life loathes bread, and his soul desirable food.
His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones which once were not seen are laid bare.
Yea, his soul draws near the Pit, and his life to the executioners.
If there is a messenger for him, a mediator, one among a thousand, to declare for man his uprightness,
then let Him be gracious to him and say, Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom.
His flesh shall be fresh like a youth’s, he shall return to the days of his vigor.
He shall pray unto God, and He will delight in him; he shall see His face with joy, for He restores to man His righteousness.
Then he observes men and says, I have sinned, and perverted what was right; and it has not been equaled to me.
He has redeemed my soul from passing over to the Pit, and my life shall see the light.
Lo, the Mighty God works all these things twice or three times with a man,
to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the Light of Life.
Pay attention, Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you.
If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.
Elihu further answered and said:
Hear my words, you wise men; give ear to me, you who have knowledge.
For the ear examines words as the palate tastes food.
Let us choose justice for ourselves; let us know among ourselves what is good.
For Job has said, I am righteous, but the Mighty God has taken away my justice;
should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water,
who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?
For he has said, It profits a man nothing when he is pleasing to God.
Therefore listen to me, you men with heart: far be it from the Mighty God to do wickedness, and from the Almighty to do injustice.
For He repays man according to his work, and causes him to attain according to his way.
Surely the Mighty God will never do wickedly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.
Who has given Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed Him over the whole world?
If He should set His heart on it, if He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,
all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.
If you have understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words:
Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn a righteous mighty one?
Is it fitting to say to a king, You are worthless; and to nobles, You are wicked?
He is not partial to rulers, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; for they are all the work of His hands.
In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; people convulse and pass away; the mighty are taken away without a hand.
For His eyes are on the ways of man, and He sees all his steps.
There is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
For He does not lay more upon man, that he should go before the Mighty God in judgment.
He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry, and makes others stand in their place.
Therefore he knows their works; He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.
He chastises them as wicked men, in a place where others can see,
because they have turned aside from following Him, and have not considered any of His ways,
so that they cause the cry of the poor to come to Him; for He hears the cry of the lowly.
When He gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can see Him? It might be against a nation or mankind altogether,
so that the hypocrite should not reign, lest the people be ensnared.
For has anyone said to the Mighty God, I have endured; I will offend no more;
teach me what I do not see; if I have done injustice, I will do no more?
Shall He recompense on your terms, just because you have rejected it? You must choose, and not I; therefore speak what you know.
Men with heart say to me, wise men who listen to me:
Job speaks without knowledge, his words are without insight.
Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, because his answers are like those of wicked men!
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against the Mighty God.
Moreover Elihu answered and said:
Do you think this is just? Do you say, I am more righteous than the Mighty God?
For you say, What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
I will answer your words, and your friends with you.
Look to the heavens and see; and behold the clouds; they are higher than you.
If you sin, what do you do against Him? Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?
If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand?
Your wickedness is for a man such as yourself, and your righteousness a son of man.
Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.
But no one says, Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the arrogance of evil men.
Surely, the Mighty God will not listen to vanity, nor will the Almighty regard it.
Although you say you do not see Him, yet the case is before Him, and you must wait for Him.
And now, because He has not punished in His anger, nor taken notice of great folly,
therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge.
Elihu also continued on and said:
Bear with me a little, and I will show you that there are yet words to speak on God’s behalf.
I will take away my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
For truly my words are not false; the One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.
Behold, the Mighty God is great, and refuses no one; He is mighty in strength and heart.
He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the lowly.
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; but they are on the throne with kings, for He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.
And if they are bound in fetters, caught in cords of affliction,
then He declares to them their work and their transgressions; that they have acted proudly.
He also opens their ear to instruction, and commands that they turn back from iniquity.
If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in good, and their years in pleasures.
But if they do not obey, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; they do not cry for help when He has bound them.
Their soul dies in youth, and their life is among the male temple prostitutes.
He delivers the poor in their affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.
Indeed He would have brought you out of the mouth of distress, into a broad place where there is no constraint; and what is set on your table would be full of fatness.
But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice take hold of you.
Beware wrath, lest He entice you away to a mocking slap; for a large ransom will not turn it away.
He will not esteem your cry for help, riches, strength or might.
Do not long for the night, when people retreat into their place.
Take heed and do not turn away to iniquity, for you have chosen this rather than affliction.
Behold, the Mighty God is exalted by His power; who teaches like Him?
Who has assigned Him His way, or who has said, You have done wrong?
Remember to magnify His work, of which men have sung.
Mankind has seen it; man regards it from afar.
Behold, the Mighty God is great, and we cannot find Him out; nor can the number of His years be searched out.
For He draws up drops of water, which distill as rain from the mist,
which the clouds drop down and pour abundantly upon man.
Also, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunder from His canopy?
Behold, He has spread his light upon it, and has covered the bottom of the sea.
For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance.
He covers His hands with lightning, and gives charge to strike the mark.
His thunder declares it; the cattle also go up.
At this also my heart trembles, and leaps from its place.
Listen to hear the thunder of His voice, and the rumbling that comes out of His mouth.
He has let it loose under the whole heavens, His lightning unto the ends of the earth.
After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, and He does not hold back when His voice is heard.
The Mighty God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend.
For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth; likewise to the showers of rain and the showers of heavy rain.
He seals up the hand of every man, that all men may know His work.
The beasts go into dens, and remain in their lairs.
Out of the chamber comes the windstorm, and cold from the scattering winds.
By the breath of the Mighty God frost is given, and the expanse of the waters is frozen.
He also loads the thick clouds with moisture; He scatters His bright clouds;
and they swirl round about at His direction, that they may do whatever He commands them on the face of the world upon the earth.
He causes it to come, whether as a rod, or for His land, or for mercy.
Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of the Mighty God.
Do you know when God appoints them, and causes the lightning of His cloud to shine?
Do you know how the clouds are balanced, those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
How your garments are warm, when He quiets the earth with the south wind?
Have you spread out the clouds with Him, firm as a molten mirror?
Teach us what we should say to Him, for we can not set our case in order in the face of darkness.
Should He be told that I wish to speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up.
Even now men cannot look at the brilliance of the sunlight in the clouds, when the wind has passed and cleared them.
Golden splendor comes out of the north; with God is awesome majesty.
As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is great in power, in justice and abundant righteousness; He does not afflict.
Therefore men fear Him; He does not regard the wise of heart.
Then Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest, and said:
Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
Now gird up your loins like a man; I will consult with you, and you declare unto Me.
Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have become acquainted with understanding.
Who has fixed its measurements? Surely you know! Or who has stretched the line upon it?
To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,
when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
Or who shut in the sea with doors, when it burst forth and came forth from the womb;
when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling band;
when I broke My limit for it, and set bars and doors;
and said, This far you may come, but no farther, and here your proud waves shall stay!?
Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place,
that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?
It takes on form like clay under a seal, and stands out like a garment.
From the wicked their light is withheld, and the lofty arm is broken.
Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths?
Have the gates of death been disclosed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Declare, if you know it all!
Where is the way to where light dwells? And darkness, where is its place,
that you may take it to its territory, that you may observe the paths to its house?
You know, because you were born then, and because the number of your days is great.
Have you entered the storehouses of snow, or have you seen the storehouses of hail,
which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?
By what way is light diffused, or the east wind scattered over the earth?
Who has split a channel for the flood, or a path for the thunderbolt,
to cause it to rain on a land where there is no man, a wilderness devoid of mankind;
to satisfy the desolate waste, and cause to spring forth the growth of vegetation?
Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew?
From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of the heavens, who has given it birth?
The waters harden like stone, and the surface of the deep is stuck together.
Can you bind the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?
Can you bring out the constellations in their seasons? Or can you guide Ursa Major with its sons?
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you appoint their authority over the earth?
Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that an abundance of water may cover you?
Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, and say to you, Here we are!?
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?
Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can lay down the pitchers of the heavens,
when the dust is poured into castings, and the clods cling together?
Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
when they crouch in their dens, or sit in their lairs to lie in wait?
Who provides food for the raven, when its young ones cry out to the Mighty God, and wander about for lack of food?
Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? Or can you keep watch for when the deer gives birth?
Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth,
when they crouch, bring forth their young, and deliver their pangs?
Their young ones are healthy, they grow up with grain; when they have departed they do not return to them.
Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bands of the wild ass,
whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwelling?
He scorns the tumult of the city; he does not heed the clamor of the driver.
The mountain ranges are his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.
Will the oryx consent to serve you? Will he pass the night by your feeding trough?
Can you bind the oryx in the furrow with ropes? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?
Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him?
Will you trust him to bring back your grain, and gather it to your threshing floor?
Have you made the wings of the ostrich flap joyously, or the wings and feathers of the stork?
For she leaves her eggs on the ground, and warms them in the dust;
she does not care that a foot may crush them, or that a beast of the field may trample them.
She treats her young roughly, as if they were not hers; her labor is in vain without fear,
because God has caused her to forget wisdom, and has not imparted understanding to her.
When she lifts herself on high, she laughs at the horse and its rider.
Have you given the horse its strength? Have you clothed its neck with a mane?
Can you make him leap like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror.
He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; he goes forth to meet the weapons.
He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed; nor does he turn back from the sword.
The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and javelin.
He swallows the ground with rumbling and agitation; nor does he stand still at the sound of the shofar.
Every time the shofar sounds he says, Aha! He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of captains and shouting.
Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and spread its wings toward the south?
Does the eagle mount up at your mouth, and make its nest on high?
It settles down and dwells on the rocks, on the crag of the rock and the stronghold.
From there it searches for food; its eyes see great distances.
Its young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.
Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said:
Shall the one who contends with the Almighty find fault? He who reproves God, let him testify.
Then Job answered Jehovah and said:
Behold, I have been vile! What shall I answer You? I have put my hand to my mouth.
Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.
Then Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest, and said:
Now gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you declare unto Me:
Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me so that you may be justified?
Have you an arm like the Mighty God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His?
Adorn yourself with majesty and grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor.
Scatter abroad the outburst of your anger; look upon everyone who is proud, and humiliate him.
Look upon everyone who is proud, and humble him; tread down the wicked in their place.
Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.
Then I will also confess to you that your own right hand can save you.
Behold now, Behemoth, which I made along with you; he eats grass like an ox.
See now, his power is in his hips, and his strength is in the muscles of his belly.
He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together.
His bones are like channels of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron.
He is the first of the ways of the Mighty God; only He who made him can bring near His sword.
Surely the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there.
He lies under the lotus, in the shelter of the reeds and marsh.
The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him.
If the river becomes violent he is not alarmed; he is confident, though the Jordan bursts forth against his mouth.
Can anyone capture him before his eyes, or pierce his nose with snares?
Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook, or snare his tongue with a cord which you let down?
Can you put a reed rope through his nose, or pierce his jaw with a hook?
Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak gentle words to you?
Will he make a covenant with you? Will you capture him as a slave forever?
Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you bind him on a leash for your maidens?
Will your associates bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
Can you fill his skin with barbs, or his head with fishing spears?
Lay your hand upon him; remember the battle; you will not do it again!
Behold, any hope regarding him is false; shall one not be thrown down at the mere sight of him?
No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand before Me?
Who has anticipated Me, that I should repay? Everything under the heavens is Mine.
I will not keep silent with lies about his mighty utterances, or his graceful proportions.
Who has laid bare the face of his apparel? Who can come upon him with a double bridle?
Who has opened the doors of his face, with his terrible teeth all around?
His rows of shields are his pride, closed up as a tight seal;
one is so near another that no air can come between them;
they are joined one to another, they stick together and cannot be separated.
His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.
Out of his mouth go burning torches; sparks of fire shoot out.
Smoke goes out of his nostrils, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes.
His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
Strength abides in his neck, and sorrow dances before him.
The folds of his flesh are joined together; they are firm on him and cannot be moved.
His heart is cast hard as stone, even cast hard as the lower millstone.
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of his crashings they are beside themselves.
Though the sword overtakes him, it does not stick; nor does spear, dart, or javelin.
He regards iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood.
The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned into stubble by him.
Darts are regarded as straw; he laughs at the rattling of javelins.
His undersides are like sharp potsherds; he spreads sharp marks in the mire.
He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
He leaves a shining wake behind him; one would think the deep was gray-headed.
On earth there is nothing like him, which is made without fear.
He beholds every high thing; he is king over all the children of pride.
Then Job answered Jehovah and said:
I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose is withheld from You.
You asked, Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge? So I have proclaimed what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
Grant me this request, and I will speak: I will inquire of You, and You declare to me.
I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye has seen You.
Therefore I despise myself, and have repented in dust and ashes.
And so it was, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath has been kindled against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.
Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job will pray for you; for I accept him; lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah commanded them; for Jehovah accepted Job.
And Jehovah returned what had been taken captive from Job when he prayed for his friends. Indeed Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.
Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of money and each a ring of gold.
So Jehovah blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.
He also had seven sons and three daughters.
And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.
In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.
After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren to four generations.
So Job died, old and full of days.
Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor has stood in the way of sinners, nor has sat in the seat of the scornful.
But his delight is in the Law of Jehovah; and in His Law he meditates day and night.
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not wither, and all that he does shall prosper.
The wicked are not so, but are like chaff which the wind drives away.
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
For Jehovah knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.
Why do the nations rage, and the peoples devise a vain thing?
The kings of the earth take their stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah and against His anointed, saying,
Let us break and tear away their bonds, and cast away their cords from us.
He who sits in the Heavens shall laugh; Jehovah shall have them in derision.
Then He shall speak to them in His anger, and terrify them in His wrath.
Yet, I have set My King on My holy hill of Zion.
I will declare the decree: Jehovah has said unto Me, You are My Son; today I have begotten You.
Ask of Me, and I will give the nations for Your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Your possession.
You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
And now be wise, O kings; be instructed, you judges of the earth.
Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.
<b>[A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom]</b> -- O Jehovah, how my adversaries have increased! Many are they who rise up against me.
Many are saying of my soul, There is no deliverance for him in God. Selah.
But You, O Jehovah, are a shield for me; my glory, the One who lifts up my head.
I cried unto Jehovah with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.
I lay down and slept. I awoke, for Jehovah sustained me.
I am not afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
Arise, O Jehovah; deliver me, O my God; for You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Salvation belongs to Jehovah. Your blessing is on Your people. Selah.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have enlarged me in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
O you sons of men, how long will you turn My glory into shame? Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? Selah.
But know that Jehovah has set apart the godly for Himself. Jehovah hears when I call unto Him.
Tremble, and sin not; commune within your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.
There are many who say, Who will show us any good? Jehovah, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.
You have put gladness in my heart, more than during the time when their grain and their wine increased.
I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; for You alone, Jehovah, make me dwell in safety.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Nehiloth. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Give ear to my words, O Jehovah; consider my meditation.
Give attention to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for unto You will I pray.
My voice shall You hear in the morning, O Jehovah; in the morning I will direct my prayer unto You, and I will look up.
For You are not a Mighty God that delights in wickedness; nor shall evil dwell with You.
The boastful shall not stand in Your sight. You hate all doers of iniquity.
You shall destroy those who speak lies; Jehovah abhors the man of blood and treachery.
But as for me, I will come into Your house in the abundance of Your mercy; I will bow down in Your fear toward Your holy temple.
Lead me, O Jehovah, in Your righteousness, because of my enemies; make Your way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against You.
But let all those who put their trust in You rejoice; let them always shout for joy, because You defend them. And let those who love Your name be joyful in You.
For You, O Jehovah, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as with a shield.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Sheminith. A Psalm of David]</b> -- O Jehovah, rebuke me not in Your anger, nor chasten me in Your fury.
Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am weak; O Jehovah, heal me, for my bones are anxious.
My soul also is exceedingly anxious; but You, O Jehovah, how long?
Return, O Jehovah, rescue my soul! Deliver me because of Your goodness!
For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol who will give thanks to You?
I am weary from my groaning; all night I make my bed swim; I dissolve my couch with my tears.
My eye has wasted away because of grief; it has grown weak because of all my enemies.
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for Jehovah has heard the voice of my weeping.
Jehovah has heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly dismayed; let them turn back and be ashamed in a moment.
<b>[A song of David, which he sang to Jehovah, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite]</b> -- O Jehovah my God, in You I put my trust; deliver me from all those who pursue me, and rescue me,
lest they tear my soul like a lion, tearing it in pieces, and there is no one to rescue.
O Jehovah my God, if I have done this: if there is iniquity in my hands;
if I have repaid evil to one who was at peace with me, or if I have plundered my enemy without cause;
let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it; yea, let him trample down my life upon the earth and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
Arise, O Jehovah, in Your anger; lift up Yourself because of the rage of my enemies, and arouse Yourself for me to the judgment which You have commanded.
Thus the congregation of the people shall surround You; for their sakes, therefore, return on high.
Jehovah shall judge the people; judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity within me.
O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the just. For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.
My defense is from God, who saves the upright in heart.
God judges the righteous, and the Mighty God is angry with the wicked every day.
If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He has bent His bow and made it ready.
He has also prepared instruments of death for him; He makes His arrows hotly pursue.
Behold, he writhes in iniquity, and has conceived trouble, and has brought forth falsehood.
He has excavated a cistern and dug it, and has fallen into the pit which he made.
His trouble shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own crown.
I will praise Jehovah according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm of David]</b> -- O Jehovah our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens!
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You might remove the enemy and the avenger.
When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which You have established;
what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?
For You have made him lacking a little from God, and have crowned him with glory and honor.
You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet:
all sheep and oxen, even the beasts of the field;
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea passing through the paths of the seas.
O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Muthlabben. A Psalm of David]</b> -- I will praise You, O Jehovah, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
When my enemies have turned back, they shall fall and perish at Your presence.
For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.
You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked, You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
The desolations of the enemy have come to an end forever, and You have destroyed the cities; the remembrance of them has perished with them.
But Jehovah shall endure forever; He has prepared His throne for justice.
And He shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall execute judgment to the people with equity.
Jehovah also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of distress.
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; for You, Jehovah, have not forsaken those who seek You.
Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwells in Zion; declare His deeds among the nations.
When He investigates bloodshed, He forgets not the cry of the lowly.
Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; look upon my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,
so that I may declare all Your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in Your salvation.
The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; their own foot is caught in the net which they hid.
Jehovah is known. He has executed judgment; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
The wicked shall be turned away into Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
For the needy shall not always be forgotten; the expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.
Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail. Let the nations be judged before Your face.
Put them in fear, O Jehovah; let the nations know that they are but men. Selah.
Why do You stand afar off, O Jehovah? Will You hide in times of distress?
The wicked in his pride persecutes the lowly; let them be caught in the plots that they have devised.
For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire, and blesses those who plunder, whom Jehovah has spurned.
Through the pride of his countenance the wicked do not seek after God; God is not in all his schemes.
His ways are always twisted; Your judgments are high, out of his sight. As for all his enemies, he snorts at them.
He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved; from generation to generation I shall not be in adversity!
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are trouble and wickedness.
He sits in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent; his eyes are hidden against the unfortunate ones.
He lies in wait secretly, like a lion in his den. He lies in wait to catch the poor; he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.
He lies low and crouches, and the poor unfortunate ones have fallen by his might.
He has said in his heart, the Mighty God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will never see it!
Arise, O Jehovah! O Mighty God, lift up Your hand! Forget not the lowly poor.
Why have the wicked spurned God? He has said in his heart, You will not investigate.
But You have seen it, for You pay attention to trouble and provocation; to repay it with Your hand. The poor commits himself to You; You are the Helper of the fatherless.
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil one; investigate his wickedness, until You find no more.
Jehovah is King forever and ever; the nations have perished out of His land.
Jehovah, You have heard the desire of the lowly; You will prepare their heart, You will cause Your ear to hear,
to vindicate the fatherless and the oppressed, so that the man of the earth may terrify no more.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- In Jehovah I put my trust; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to the mountains?
For lo, the wicked bend their bow; they make ready their arrow on the string, so that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.
If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
Jehovah is in His holy temple; Jehovah’s throne is in Heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids examine the sons of men.
Jehovah tries the righteous; but His soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.
Upon the wicked He will rain snares, fire and brimstone; and a horrible tempest shall be the portion of their cup.
For the righteous Jehovah loves righteousness; His face beholds the upright.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Sheminith. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Help, Jehovah, for the godly man ceases; for the faithful have vanished from among the sons of men.
They speak vanity each one with his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
Jehovah shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaks proud things,
that has said, We shall be strong with our tongue; our lips are our own; who is lord over us?
For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, I will now arise, says Jehovah; I will set him in the safety for which he pants.
The Words of Jehovah are pure Words, like silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
You shall keep them, O Jehovah, You shall preserve them from this generation forever.
The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- How long will You forget me, O Jehovah? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my inner being daily? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
Consider and answer me, O Jehovah my God; enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him, and those who oppress me rejoice when I am shaken.
But I have trusted in Your mercy; my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.
I will sing to Jehovah, because He has dealt bountifully with me.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- The fool has said in his heart, There is no God! They are corrupt; they have done abominable works, there is no one who does good.
Jehovah looked down from Heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who understood and sought God.
They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, no, not one.
Have all the workers of iniquity not known, eating up My people as they eat bread? They have not called upon Jehovah.
There they were in great fear; for God is in the generation of the righteous.
You shame the counsel of the lowly, for Jehovah is his refuge.
Oh that the salvation of Israel was out of Zion! When Jehovah brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- O Jehovah, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy hill?
He who walks uprightly, and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart;
he who does not backbite with his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
in whose eyes the reprobate is despised, but he honors those who fear Jehovah; he has sworn to his hurt, and does not change it;
he has not put out his money at interest, nor has he taken a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
<b>[Michtam of David]</b> -- Watch over me, O Mighty God, for in You I put my trust.
Oh my soul, you have said to Jehovah, You are my Lord; I have no goodness apart from You.
As for the saints who are on the earth, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood; and I will not take up their names on my lips.
Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; You shall uphold my lot.
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.
I will bless Jehovah, who has given me counsel; my heart also instructs me at night.
I have set Jehovah always before Me; because He is at My right hand, I shall not be moved.
Therefore My heart is glad, and My glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope;
for You will not leave My soul in Sheol; nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
You will make known to Me the way of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy. At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
<b>[A Prayer of David]</b> -- Hear a just cause, O Jehovah; give attention to my cry, listen to my prayer; for it is not from deceitful lips.
Let my sentence come forth from Your presence; let Your eyes behold with equity.
You have examined my heart; You have visited me in the night; You have tried me, and found nothing; I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
Concerning the works of men, by the Words of Your lips, I have kept from the paths of the destroyer.
My steps have been upheld in Your paths, so that my footsteps have not slipped.
I have called upon You, for You hear me, O Mighty God; extend Your ear to me, and hear my speech.
Set apart Your wonderful lovingkindness, O You who by Your right hand saves those who trust in You, from those who rise up against me.
Keep me as the pupil of the eye; hide me under the shadow of Your wings,
from the face of the wicked who have devastated me; from the enemies of my soul who surround me.
They are enclosed in their own fat; with their mouths they speak proudly.
They have encompassed us in our steps, they keep watch with their eyes, lying down on the ground,
like a lion that longs to tear, and like a young lion lurking in secret places.
Arise, O Jehovah, forestall him; bow him down; deliver my soul from the wicked with Your sword,
from men by Your hand, O Jehovah, from men of the world whose portion is in this life, and whose belly You fill with Your hidden treasure. They are satisfied with children, and leave an abundance to their infants.
As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with the image of You.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah, who spoke unto Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. And he said,]</b> -- I love You, O Jehovah, my strength.
Jehovah is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; my Mighty God, my rock wall, in whom I will trust; He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.
I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised; so shall I be delivered from my enemies.
The cords of death have surrounded me, and the floods of the wicked made me afraid.
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death have confronted me.
In my distress I called upon Jehovah, and cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, and my cry came before Him, into His ears.
Then the earth shook and trembled; and the foundations of the hills quaked and were shaken, because He was angry.
Smoke went up out of His nostrils, and fire devoured out of His mouth; coals were kindled by it.
He also bowed the heavens and came down, and darkness was under His feet.
And He rode upon a cherub, and soared; yea, He flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind.
He made darkness His secret place; His pavilion around Him was dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
From the brightness before Him, His dark clouds passed over with hailstones and coals of fire.
Jehovah also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave forth His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.
Yea, He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He shot out lightnings and confounded them.
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at Your rebuke, O Jehovah, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters.
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me; for they were too strong for me.
They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but Jehovah was my support.
He brought me forth also into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me.
Jehovah rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has given back to me.
For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
For all His judgments were before me, and I did not put away His Statutes from me.
I was also perfect before Him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
Therefore Jehovah has given back to me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.
With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; with a perfect man You will show Yourself perfect;
with the pure You will show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You will show Yourself twisted.
For You will save the lowly people, but will bring down lofty looks.
For You will light my lamp; Jehovah my God will cause my darkness to shine.
For by You I run against a troop; and by my God I leap over a wall.
As for the Mighty God, His way is perfect; the Word of Jehovah is tested; He is a shield to all those who trust in Him.
For who is God besides Jehovah? Or, who is a Rock except our God?
It is the Mighty God who clasps me with strength and makes my way perfect.
He makes my feet like the feet of deer, and sets me on my high places.
He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of bronze is stretched by my arms.
You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; and Your right hand has held me up, and Your meekness has made me great.
You enlarged the place for my steps under me, so that my feet have not slipped.
I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; nor did I turn back until they were destroyed.
I have shattered them, and they cannot rise again; they have fallen under my feet.
For You have clasped me with strength for the battle; You bowed down under me those who rose up against me.
You have also given me the necks of my enemies; so that I annihilated those who hated me.
They cried out for help, but there was no one to deliver; even to Jehovah, but He did not answer them.
Then I beat them fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like the dirt in the streets.
You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me; the children of foreigners shall cower before me.
The children of foreigners shall fall down and come trembling out of their holes.
Jehovah lives! Blessed be my rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted!
It is the Mighty God who avenges me, and puts the people to flight.
He delivers me from my enemies; yea, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.
Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Jehovah, among the nations, and make music unto Your name,
who gives great deliverance to His king, and deals mercy to His anointed, to David and to his seed forevermore.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- The heavens declare the glory of the Mighty God; and the firmament proclaims His handiwork.
Day unto day pours forth speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge.
There is no speech nor words where their voice is not heard.
Their line has gone out through all the earth and their words to the ends of the world. In them He has set a tent for the sun,
which comes forth like a bridegroom out from his chamber; he exults as a strong man to run a race,
going forth from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the ends of it. And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
The Law of Jehovah is perfect, converting the soul; the Testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the simple.
The Statutes of Jehovah are upright, rejoicing the heart; the Commandments of Jehovah are pure, illuminating the eyes.
The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of Jehovah are true and altogether just,
more to be desired than gold, even than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
And Your servant is warned by them; in keeping them there is great reward.
Who can understand his errors? Acquit me of that which is hidden;
restrain Your servant from arrogance; do not let them rule over me. Then I shall be perfect, and I shall be innocent of great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O Jehovah, my Rock and my Redeemer.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress, and the name of the God of Jacob set you securely on high,
sending you help from the sanctuary, and sustaining you out of Zion.
May He remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt offering. Selah.
May He grant you according to your inner heart, and fulfill all your counsel.
We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up banners; may Jehovah fulfill all your petitions.
Now I know that Jehovah saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy Heaven with the saving strength of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of Jehovah our God.
They have bowed down and fallen; but we have risen and stand upright.
Save, O Jehovah! Let the King answer us when we call.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- The king shall rejoice in Your strength, O Jehovah; and in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
You have given him his heart’s desire, and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
For You go before him with the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold upon his head.
He asked life from You; You give to him length of days forever and ever.
His glory is great in Your salvation; honor and majesty You have placed upon him.
For You have made him most blessed forever; You have made him rejoice with gladness in Your presence.
For the king trusts in Jehovah, and through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.
Your hand shall find out all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find out those who hate You.
You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your presence; Jehovah will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
Their fruit shall You destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.
For they intended evil against You; they devised a plot which they were not able to accomplish.
For You will make them turn their back; You will make ready Your arrows on Your strings against their faces.
Be exalted, O Jehovah, in Your own strength! We will sing, and make music unto Your power.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Aijeleth Shahar. A Psalm of David]</b> -- My Mighty God, My Mighty God, why have You forsaken Me, and are far from My deliverance, and from the words of My groaning?
O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not answer; and in the nighttime, and am not silent.
But You are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted, and You delivered them.
They cried to You, and were delivered; they trusted in You, and were not ashamed.
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised by the people.
All who see Me mock Me; they shoot out the lip; they shake the head, saying,
He trusted on Jehovah; let Him deliver Him; let Him rescue Him, since He delights in Him!
For You are He who took Me out of the womb, causing Me to trust while on My mother’s breasts.
I was cast upon You from the womb; You are My Mighty God from My mother’s belly.
Be not far from Me, for trouble is near; for there is no one to help.
Many bulls have encircled Me; strong bulls of Bashan have surrounded Me.
They have gaped at Me with their mouths, like a tearing and roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all My bones are separated; My heart is like wax, it has melted within Me.
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and My tongue clings to My jaws; and You have brought Me into the dust of death.
For dogs have surrounded Me; the congregation of the wicked have enclosed Me. They have pierced My hands and My feet.
I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me.
They divide My garments among them and cast lots for My clothing.
But You, O Jehovah, be not far from Me; O My Strength, make haste to help Me!
Deliver My soul from the sword, My only one from the hand of the dog.
Deliver Me from the lion’s mouth; from the horns of the oryx. You have answered Me.
I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise You.
You who fear Jehovah, praise Him! All you seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and fear Him all you seed of Israel!
For He has not despised nor detested the affliction of the afflicted; nor has He hidden His face from him; but when he cried out to Him, He heard.
My praise shall be of You in the great assembly; I will make good My vows before those who fear Him.
The lowly shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek Jehovah shall praise Him; your heart shall live forever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Jehovah; and all the families of the nations shall bow down before You.
For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; and He rules over the nations.
All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and bow down; all those who go down to the dust shall bow before Him, for no one can keep alive his own soul.
A seed shall serve Him; it shall be recounted of Jehovah to the coming generation.
They shall come, and shall declare His righteousness to a people that shall yet be born, that He has done this.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Jehovah is my Shepherd; I shall not want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me to waters of rest.
He restores my soul; He leads me in paths of righteousness because of His great name.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah forever.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fullness of it; the world, and those who dwell in it.
For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the rivers.
Who shall go up into the hill of Jehovah? Or who shall stand in His holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
He shall receive the blessing from Jehovah, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
This is the generation of Jacob of those who seek Him, who seek Your face. Selah.
Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of Glory shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O you gates! Lift up, you everlasting doors! And the King of Glory shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory? Jehovah of Hosts, He is the King of Glory. Selah.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Unto You, O Jehovah, do I lift up my soul.
O my God, I trust in You; do not let me be ashamed; let not my enemies triumph over me.
Yea, let none who wait upon You be ashamed; let them be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause.
Make me know Your ways, O Jehovah; teach me Your paths.
Lead me in Your truth, and teach me; for You are the God of my salvation; upon You do I wait all day long.
Remember, O Jehovah, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses; for they are from antiquity.
Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; according to Your mercy remember me for Your goodness’ sake, O Jehovah.
Good and upright is Jehovah; therefore He teaches sinners in the way.
The lowly He guides in justice, and the lowly He teaches His way.
All the paths of Jehovah are mercy and truth, to those who keep His Covenant and His Testimonies.
Because of Your great name, O Jehovah, pardon my iniquity; for it is great.
Who is the man that fears Jehovah? He shall teach him in the way that He chooses.
His soul shall dwell in good things; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
The secret of Jehovah is with those who fear Him; and He will make them know His Covenant.
My eyes are ever toward Jehovah; for He shall pluck my feet out of the net.
Turn to me, and have mercy upon me, for I am alone and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.
Look upon my affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.
Consider my enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
Keep my soul, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in You.
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I have waited upon You.
Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity. I have trusted also in Jehovah; I shall not slip.
Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; purify my being and my heart.
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your Truth.
I have not sat with men of vanity, neither will I go in with hypocrites.
I have hated the assembly of evildoers, and will not sit with the wicked.
I will wash my hands in innocence; thus I will go around Your altar, O Jehovah,
so that I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all Your marvelous works.
Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling place of Your house, and the place where Your honor dwells.
Do not take away my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood,
in whose hands is an evil plot, and their right hand is full of bribes.
But I will walk in my integrity; redeem me and be merciful unto me.
My foot stands in an even place; in the congregations I will bless Jehovah.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this I have confidence.
One thing I have desired from Jehovah, that I will seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in His temple.
For in the time of evil He shall hide me in His den, in the secrecy of His tent He shall hide me; He shall lift me up upon a rock.
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; and I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tent. I will sing; yea, I will make music unto Jehovah.
Hear, O Jehovah, when I cry out with my voice, and have mercy upon me and answer me.
When You say, Seek My face, my heart has said unto You, Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek.
Hide not Your face from me; turn not Your servant away in anger. You have been my help; do not leave me, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.
When my father and my mother forsake me, then Jehovah will gather me up.
Teach me Your way, O Jehovah, and lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies.
Do not deliver me over to the will of my enemies; for false witnesses have risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.
I would have fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living.
Wait upon Jehovah; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, upon Jehovah!
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- I will cry unto You, O Jehovah my Rock: Do not be silent to me, lest, if You be deaf to me, I become like those who go down into the pit.
Hear the voice of my supplications when I cry out to You, when I lift up my hands toward Your Holy of Holies.
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, yet evil is in their hearts.
Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their practices; give them according to the work of their hands; give back to them what they deserve.
Because they do not consider the works of Jehovah nor the works of His hands, He shall destroy them and not build them up.
Blessed is Jehovah, because He has heard the voice of my supplications.
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; my heart has trusted in Him, and I have been helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song I will praise Him.
Jehovah is their strength, and He is the saving refuge of His anointed.
Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them also, and bear them up forever.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Ascribe unto Jehovah, O you sons of God, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due His name; bow down before Jehovah in the beauty of holiness.
The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; the Mighty God of Glory thunders; Jehovah is over many waters.
The voice of Jehovah is powerful, the voice of Jehovah is full of majesty.
The voice of Jehovah breaks the cedars; yea, Jehovah shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
He also makes them skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young oryx.
The voice of Jehovah cleaves the flames of fire.
The voice of Jehovah shakes the wilderness; Jehovah shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of Jehovah causes the deer to give birth, and lays bare the forests; and in His temple they all say, Glory!
Jehovah has dwelt at the Flood; yea, Jehovah remains as King forever.
Jehovah will give strength to His people; Jehovah will bless His people with peace.
<b>[A Psalm and Song at the dedication of the House of David]</b> -- I will exalt You, O Jehovah, for You have lifted me up, and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.
O Jehovah my God, I cried out to You, and You have healed me.
O Jehovah, You have brought up my soul from Sheol; You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the Pit.
Make music unto Jehovah, O you saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
For His anger is but for a moment; in His favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
O Jehovah, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong; You hid Your face, and I was troubled.
I cried out to You, O Jehovah; and unto Jehovah I made supplication.
What profit is there in my blood, in going down to the pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?
Hear, O Jehovah, and have mercy upon me; Jehovah, be my helper!
You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have loosened my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
so that my glory may make music unto You, and not be silent. O Jehovah my God, I will give thanks unto You forever.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- In You, O Jehovah, I put my trust; let me never be ashamed; deliver me in Your righteousness.
Extend Your ear to me; rescue me quickly; be my rock of refuge, a house of defense to deliver me.
For You are my rock and my fortress; therefore for Your great name lead me and guide me.
Bring me out of the net that they have hid for me, for You are my strength.
Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the Mighty God of Truth.
I have hated those who regard lying vanities; but I trust in Jehovah.
I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy; for You have looked upon my affliction; You have known the distress of my soul,
and have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a broad place.
Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah, for I am in trouble; my eye has wasted away with grief; even my soul and my belly.
For my life has been spent with grief, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones have wasted away.
I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my neighbors, and an object of dread to my friends; those who saw me outside have fled from me.
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel.
For I have heard the slander of many; fear is on every side; while they take counsel together against me, they have plotted to take away my life.
But I trusted in You, O Jehovah; I have said, You are my God.
My times are in Your hand; deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.
Make Your face shine upon Your servant; in Your mercy deliver me.
Let me not be ashamed, O Jehovah; for I have called upon You. Let the wicked be ashamed; let them be silent in Sheol.
Let the lying lips be put to silence; the lips which speak with arrogance, haughtiness and contempt against the just.
How great is Your goodness, which You have treasured up for those who fear You, which You have done for those who trust in You before the sons of men!
You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the snares of man; You shall hide them in a shelter away from the strife of tongues.
Blessed is Jehovah, for He has shown me His marvelous kindness in a besieged city.
For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before Your eyes; but indeed You heard the voice of my supplications, when I cried out to You.
O love Jehovah, all you His saints; for Jehovah preserves the faithful, and abundantly recompenses the proud doer.
Be strong, and He will strengthen your heart, all you who hope in Jehovah.
<b>[A Psalm of David. Maschil]</b> -- Blessed is the man whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah does not impute iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
When I kept silent, my bones wore out through my roaring all day long.
For by day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my sap was turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
I declared my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, I will confess my transgression to Jehovah, and You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
For this let everyone who is godly pray unto You, in a time when You may be found; surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near him.
You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from distress; You shall enclose me with shouts of deliverance. Selah.
I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you should go; I will counsel you with My eye.
Do not be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, so that they do not come near you.
The wicked has many sorrows, but mercy envelops him who trusts in Jehovah.
Be glad in Jehovah and rejoice, you righteous; and shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
Rejoice in Jehovah, O you righteous ones! Praise is becoming to the upright.
Praise Jehovah with harp; make music unto Him with a lute and an instrument of ten strings.
Sing unto Him a new song; play beautifully with shouts of joy.
For the Word of Jehovah is right; and all His works are in truth.
He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the goodness of Jehovah.
By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.
He gathers the waters of the sea like a heap, and designates the depths in storehouses.
Let all the earth fear Jehovah; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.
Jehovah brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He restrains and frustrates the devices of the people.
The counsel of Jehovah stands forever, the thoughts of His heart from generation to generation.
Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah; the people He has chosen for His possession.
Jehovah looks down from Heaven; He watches all the sons of mankind.
From His dwelling place He gazes upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
He fashions their hearts together; He understands all their works.
The king is not delivered by the multitude of an army; a mighty man is not rescued by much strength.
A horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he provide escape by his great strength.
Behold, the eye of Jehovah is upon those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy;
to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for Jehovah; He is our help and our shield.
For our heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in His holy name.
Let Your mercy, O Jehovah, be upon us, according as we have hoped in You.
<b>[A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed]</b> -- I will bless Jehovah at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
My soul shall make its boast in Jehovah; the lowly shall hear and be glad.
O magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt His name together.
I sought Jehovah, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
They looked to Him, and were radiant; and their faces were not ashamed.
This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard, and delivered him out of all his troubles.
The Angel of Jehovah encamps round about those who fear Him, and rescues them.
O taste and see that Jehovah is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him.
O fear Jehovah, you His holy ones; for there is nothing lacking to those who fear Him.
The young lions lack and suffer hunger; but those who seek Jehovah shall not lack any good thing.
Come, you children, give heed to me; I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
Who is the man that desires life, and loves days, that he may see good?
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile.
Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, and His ears are open to their cry.
The face of Jehovah is against those who do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
The righteous cry out, and Jehovah hears, and delivers them out of all their troubles.
Jehovah is near to those of a broken heart, and saves such as are of a contrite spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Jehovah delivers him out of them all.
He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
Evil shall slay the wicked; and those who hate the righteous shall be held guilty.
Jehovah redeems the soul of His servants; and none of those who trust in Him shall be held guilty.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Plead my case, O Jehovah, against those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.
Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
Also draw out the spear and close up the way against those who pursue me; say to my soul, I am your salvation.
Let those who seek after my soul be put to shame and dishonored; let those who devise evil against me be turned back and abashed.
Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the Angel of Jehovah drive them away.
Let their way be dark and slippery, and let the Angel of Jehovah pursue them.
For without cause they have hidden their net for me in a pit; without cause they have dug for my soul.
Let destruction come upon him before he knows it, and let his net which he has concealed catch him; let him fall into that very destruction.
And my soul shall be joyful in Jehovah; it shall rejoice in His salvation.
All my bones shall say, Jehovah, who is like You, who delivers the lowly from him who is too strong for him; yea, the poor and the needy from him who plunders him?
Violent witnesses rose up; they asked of me things which I have not known.
They rewarded me evil for good, to the bereavement of my soul.
But when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth; I humbled my soul with fastings; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.
As a friend, as to my brother, I walked about; as one who mourns for a mother, I was bowed down in gloom, mourning.
But at my stumbling they gathered themselves together and rejoiced; and before I knew it the attackers gathered themselves against me; they tore at me and were not still;
with the hypocrites, mockers, for a cake, they gnashed at me with their teeth.
O Jehovah, how long will You look on? Rescue my soul from their ravages, my only one from the lions.
I will give You thanks in the great assembly; I will praise You among many people.
Let not those who are my deceitful enemies rejoice over me, nor let those who hate me without cause wink with the eye.
For they do not speak peace; but they devise deceitful things against the quiet ones of the earth.
They also open wide their mouths against me and have said, Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it.
You have seen this, O Jehovah; do not keep silent; O Jehovah, do not be far from me.
Stir up Yourself and awake to my justice, to my case, my God and my Lord.
Give judgment for me, O Jehovah my God, according to Your righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, Aha! Our soul! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
Let them be ashamed and abashed together, those who rejoice over my adversity. Let them be clothed with shame and reproach who magnify themselves against me.
Let those who delight in my justification shout and rejoice; and let them say continually, Let Jehovah be magnified, who delights in the welfare of His servant.
And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness and of Your praise all day long.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, the servant of Jehovah]</b> -- The transgression of the wicked declares within my heart: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity and hate is found.
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; he has left off acting wisely and doing good.
He devises wickedness on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not despise evil.
Your mercy, O Jehovah, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
Your righteousness is like the great mountains; Your judgments are a great deep; O Jehovah, You deliver man and beast.
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of Your wings.
They shall be satisfied with the fatness of Your house; and You shall make them drink of the river of Your pleasures.
For with You is the Fountain of Life; in Your light we shall see light.
O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked cause me to wander.
There the doers of wickedness have fallen; they have been cast down, and are not able to rise.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Do not fret yourself over evil doers, nor be envious of the workers of iniquity.
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass; and wither as the green herb.
Trust in Jehovah, and do good; dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness.
Delight yourself also in Jehovah, and He shall give you the desires of your heart.
Roll your ways upon Jehovah; trust also in Him, and He will bring it to pass.
And He will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday.
Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for Him; do not fret over him who prospers in his way, because of him who works out wicked devices.
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; do not fret; it only leads to evil.
For evildoers shall be cut off; but those who wait upon Jehovah, they shall inherit the earth.
For yet a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; indeed, you shall diligently consider his place, and it shall be no more.
But the lowly shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him with his teeth.
Jehovah laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.
The wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, to slaughter those who walk uprightly.
Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
A little that the righteous has is better than the riches of many wicked.
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Jehovah upholds the righteous.
Jehovah knows the days of the upright, and their inheritance shall be forever.
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be as prized lambs; they are consumed; like smoke they vanish.
The wicked borrows and does not repay, but the righteous shows mercy and gives.
For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth, and those cursed by Him shall be cut off.
The steps of a good man are ordered by Jehovah, and he delights in His way.
Though he fall, he shall not be cast down, for Jehovah upholds his hand.
I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
All day long he is gracious and lends, and his seed is blessed.
Depart from evil and do good, and live forevermore.
For Jehovah loves justice and does not forsake His Godly ones; they are preserved forever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
The righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell in it forever.
The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, and his tongue talks of justice.
The Law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.
Jehovah will not abandon him in his hand, nor allow him to be found guilty when he is judged.
Wait upon Jehovah and keep His way, and He will lift you up to inherit the earth; when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.
I have seen the wicked, ruthless, and spreading himself like a luxuriant native tree.
Yet he passed away, and lo, he was no more; indeed, I sought for him, but he could not be found.
Observe the perfect and consider the upright one; for the latter time of that man is peace.
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
But the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; He is their strength in the time of distress.
And Jehovah will help them and deliver them; He will deliver them from the wicked and save them, because they have trusted in Him.
<b>[A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance]</b> -- O Jehovah, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, neither chasten me in Your fury.
For Your arrows pierce me, and Your hand presses down upon me.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger, nor peace within myself because of my sin.
For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
My wounds have stunk and festered, because of my foolishness.
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all day long.
For my loins are filled with inflammation, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
I am feeble and severely broken; I have roared because of the groanings of my heart.
Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You.
My heart pants; my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.
My lovers and my friends stand at a distance from my plague; and my relatives stand afar off.
And those who seek my life lay snares for me; and those who seek my hurt speak of destruction, and devise treachery all day long.
But like one who is deaf, I do not hear; and I am like a mute one who opens not his mouth.
Thus I am like a man who hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in You, O Jehovah, have I hoped; You will hear, O Lord my God.
For I said, Hear me, lest they rejoice over me; lest, when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.
For I am ready to fall, and my pain is continually before me.
For I will declare my iniquity; I am afraid because of my sin.
But my enemies are active; they are strong; and those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied.
And those who render evil for good oppose me, because I follow what is good.
Forsake me not, O Jehovah; O my God, be not far from me!
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my Salvation!
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of David]</b> -- I said, I will take heed to my ways so that I do not sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me.
I was mute with silence; I kept still, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred up.
My heart was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
O Jehovah, make me to know my end, and what is the measure of my days, that I may know how frail I am.
Behold, You have made my days as a handbreadth, and my age is as nothing before You. Surely every man, even though standing tall, is total vanity. Selah.
Surely every man walks about like a shadow! Surely they are stirred up in vain. He heaps up the produce, and does not know who shall gather it.
And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the foolish.
I was mute, I did not open my mouth; because You have done it.
Remove Your stroke away from me; I am destroyed by the blow of Your hand.
You correct a man for iniquity with rebukes, and you make his desires vanish away like a moth. Surely every man is vanity. Selah.
Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and give ear to my cry. Do not be silent at my tears; for I am a stranger with You, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Look away from me, that I may regain strength before I go away and be no more.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- I waited patiently for Jehovah, and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and secured my steps.
And He has put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God; many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in Jehovah.
Blessed is the man who makes Jehovah his trust and has not turned to the proud, nor to such as turn aside to lies.
O Jehovah my God, many are the wonderful works which You have done, and Your thoughts which are toward us; they cannot be recounted to You if I were to declare and speak of them, for they are more than can be numbered.
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; my ears You have opened. Burnt offering and sin offering You have not asked.
Then I said, Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me):
I delight to do Your will, O My God, and Your Law is within My heart.
I have preached righteousness in the great assembly; lo, I have not restrained My lips, O Jehovah, You know.
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not hidden Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great assembly.
Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O Jehovah; let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually keep watch over me.
For evils without number have encompassed me; my iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head; therefore my heart fails me.
Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; O Jehovah, make haste to help me!
Let them be ashamed and abashed together, those who seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to dishonor, those who wish me evil.
Let them be desolate as a consequence of their shame, those who say to me, Aha, aha!
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You, and the ones who love your salvation always say, Let Jehovah be magnified.
But I am poor and needy; yet Jehovah will have regard for me. You are my help and my deliverer; O my God, do not delay.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Blessed is he who gives attention to the poor; Jehovah will deliver him in the time of evil.
Jehovah will watch over him and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed on the earth; and You will not deliver him to the soul of his enemies.
Jehovah will sustain him on the bed of illness; You will change his bed of sickness.
I said, Jehovah, be merciful unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against You.
My enemies speak evil of me, saying, When will he die, and his name perish?
And when he comes to see me, he speaks vanity; his heart gathers iniquity to itself; he goes out and speaks of it.
All those who hate me whisper against me; they plot evil against me.
They say, A wicked thing is poured out upon him, and now that he lies down, he shall rise up no more.
Even the man of peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
But You, O Jehovah, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, so that I may repay them.
By this I know that You delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me.
As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, and set me before Your face forever.
Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Maschil. For the sons of Korah]</b> -- As the deer pants after the water brooks, so my soul pants after You, O God.
My soul thirsts for God, for the living Mighty God; when shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day, Where is your God?
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping the feast.
Why are you cast down, O my soul, and murmur within me? Hope in God; for I shall praise Him for the deliverance coming from His presence.
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember You from the land of Jordan, from the summits of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; all Your waves and Your billows have gone over me.
Jehovah will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me, my prayer to the Mighty God of my life.
I will say to God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
As with a shattering of my bones, my enemies have reproached me, while they say daily to me, Where is your God?
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you murmur within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him for the deliverance coming from the presence of my God.
Judge for me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
For You are the God of my strength; why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning under the oppression of the enemy?
O send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill, and to Your tabernacle.
Then I will go to the altar of God, the Mighty God, my exceeding joy; yea, on the harp I will give thanks to You, O God, my God.
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why do you murmur within me? Hope in God; for I still praise Him for the deliverance coming from the presence of my God.
<b>[To the chief Musician. For the sons of Korah. Maschil]</b> -- We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work which You did in their days, in the days of old.
You drove out the nations with Your hand, and planted them; You brought evil upon peoples and cast them out.
For they did not take the land into possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but it was Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your face, because You favored them.
You are my king, O God; command victories for Jacob.
Through You we will push our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.
For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword deliver me.
But You have delivered us from our enemies, and have put to shame those who hated us.
In God we have boasted all day long, and praise Your name forever. Selah.
But You have cast us off and put us to shame, and You do not go forth with our armies.
You make us turn back from the enemy; and those who hate us have plundered for themselves.
You have given us up like sheep for food, and have scattered us among the nations.
You sell Your people for nothing, and have not increased wealth by their price.
You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those who are round about us.
You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.
My disgrace is daily before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,
because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles; before the enemy and avenger.
All this has come upon us; yet we have not forgotten You, nor dealt falsely with Your Covenant.
Our heart is not turned back, nor have our steps turned aside from Your way,
though You have crushed us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death.
If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,
shall not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart.
Yet, for Your sake we are killed all day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arise! Do not cast us off forever.
Why do You hide Your face, and forget our affliction and distress?
For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the earth.
Arise for our help, and redeem us through Your mercy!
<b>[To the chief Musician. Shoshannim. For the sons of Korah. Maschil. A Song of the beloved]</b> -- My heart has been stirred over a good matter; I speak of my works regarding the King; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
You are the fairest of the sons of men; grace is poured into Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever.
Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One, with Your glory and Your majesty.
And ride prosperously in Your majesty, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and Your right hand shall teach You awesome things.
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies; peoples fall under You.
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness.
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows.
All Your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.
Kings’ daughters are among Your precious ones; on Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
Listen, O daughter, consider and extend your ear; forget your own people also, and your father’s house.
Thus the King shall greatly long for your beauty, for He is your Lord; bow down before Him.
And the daughter of Tyre shall come with a gift; even the rich among the peoples shall entreat your face.
The king’s daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is plaited with gold.
She shall be brought to the King in clothing of needlework; the virgins, her companions who follow, shall be brought to You.
They shall be brought with gladness and rejoicing; they shall enter into the King’s palace.
In the place of your fathers shall be your sons, whom you will make princes in all the earth.
I will make Your name to be remembered from generation to generation; therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A song for the sons of Korah. Alamoth]</b> -- God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore we will not fear when the earth changes, when mountains are slipping into the midst of the seas.
Let its waters roar and foam; let the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah.
There is a river whose streams cause rejoicing in the city of God, the consecrated place of the tabernacle of the Most High.
God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her at the break of day.
The nations raged, the kingdoms were shaken; He uttered His voice, the earth melted.
Jehovah of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
Come, behold the works of Jehovah, who has made desolations on the earth;
who makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots in the fire.
Be still, and know that I am God! I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
Jehovah of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah]</b> -- Clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout unto God with the voice of triumph!
For Jehovah Most High is awesome, a great King over all the earth.
He shall put to flight the peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
He will choose our inheritance for us, the majesty of Jacob whom He has loved. Selah.
God has gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a shofar.
Sing praises unto God, sing praises! Sing praises unto our King, sing praises!
For God is King of all the earth; sing praises with understanding.
God reigns over the nations, God sits upon the throne of His holiness.
The nobles of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.
<b>[A Song and Psalm for the Sons of Korah]</b> -- Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of His holiness.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King.
God is made known in her palaces for a refuge.
For, lo, the kings were assembled; they passed by together.
They saw it, so they marveled; they were troubled, and hurried away.
Fear took hold of them there, and writhing, like a woman giving birth.
You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of Jehovah of Hosts, in the city of our God. God will establish it forever. Selah.
We have thought of Your lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Your temple.
According to Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness.
Let Mount Zion rejoice! Let the daughters of Judah exult because of Your justice!
Walk around Zion, and go all around it; count the towers of it;
set your heart on its bulwarks, pass by its fortress; so that you may recount it to the following generation.
For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide even unto death.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah]</b> -- Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world;
both children of mankind, and sons of men, rich and poor together.
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
I will extend my ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the depravity of my supplanters surrounds me?
Those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches:
None of them can at all redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him
(for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it comes to an end forever),
that he might yet live forever and never see the pit.
For he sees wise men die; likewise the fool and the brutish ones perish, and leave their wealth to others.
Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever, and their dwelling places from generation to generation; they call their lands after their own names.
Nevertheless man, though precious, does not remain; he is like the animals that perish.
This way of theirs is their folly; yet those who follow delight in their sayings. Selah.
Like sheep they are appointed to the grave; death shall shepherd them, and the upright shall have the rule over them in the morning; their form is consumed; Sheol is their home.
But God will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol; for He will carry me away. Selah.
Be not afraid when one becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases;
for when he dies he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.
For in his life he blessed his own soul (indeed, they praise you when you do well for yourself).
But he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
A man with honor, but lacking understanding, is like the animals that perish.
<b>[A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- The Mighty God Jehovah has spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun to its going down.
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.
Our God comes, and He is not silent; a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very stormy all around Him.
He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge His people.
Gather My saints to Me, and those who make a covenant with Me by sacrifice.
Let the heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is Judge. Selah.
Hear, My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you; I am God, your God.
I will not reprove you for your sacrifices, or your burnt offerings, which are continually before Me.
I will take no bull out of your house, nor goats out of your folds;
for every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.
I know all the birds of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are Mine.
If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is Mine, and the fullness of it.
Will I eat the flesh of the mighty, or drink the blood of goats?
Offer to God thanksgiving, and make good your vows to the Most High,
and call on Me in the day of trouble; and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.
But to the wicked God says, What is it you do, to declare My Statutes, and to take up My Covenant in your mouth;
seeing as how you hate correction, and cast off My Words behind you?
When you saw a thief, then you were pleased to be with him, and have been a partaker with adulterers.
You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.
These things you have done, and I have kept silent; you thought that I was like yourself; but I will rebuke you, and set in order before your eyes.
Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be no one to deliver.
Whoever offers praise glorifies Me; and to him who orders his way, I will show the salvation of God.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba]</b> -- Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me completely from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgressions, and my sin is continually before me.
Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done evil in Your sight; that You might be found just when You speak, and pure when You judge.
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden part You shall make me to know wisdom.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which You have broken may rejoice.
Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Your presence, and take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of Your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted to You.
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue shall shout aloud of Your righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise.
For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; build the walls of Jerusalem.
Then shall You be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Maschil. A Psalm of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, David has come to the house of Ahimelech]</b> -- Why do you boast yourself in evil, O mighty man? The Mighty God is good daily.
Your tongue devises destruction, like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
You love evil more than good, and lying more than to speak righteousness. Selah.
You love all devouring words, O deceitful tongue.
The Mighty God will likewise destroy you forever; He will take you away, and pluck you out of your tent, and has rooted you out of the land of the living. Selah.
The righteous also shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
Behold, the man who did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and was strong in his wickedness.
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.
I will give thanks to You forever, because You have done it; and in the presence of Your saints I will wait upon Your name, for it is good.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Mahalath. Maschil. A Psalm of David]</b> -- The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one who does good.
God looked down from Heaven upon the children of mankind to see if any was circumspect, seeking God.
Every one of them has turned back; they have all together become corrupt; not one is doing good, no, not even one.
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? They eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.
There they fear with dread, where there was no dread, for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you; you have put them to shame because God has rejected them.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of His people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Does not David hide himself among us?]</b> -- Deliver me, O God, by Your name, and contend for me by Your strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me, and terrible men seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.
Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is with those who uphold my soul.
He will repay evil to my enemies; cut them off in Your truth.
I will freely sacrifice unto You; I will praise Your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
For He has delivered me out of all trouble; and my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Neginoth. Maschil. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not Yourself from my supplication.
Give attention to me, and hear me; I am restless in my meditation, and murmur;
because of the voice of the enemy, from the oppression of the wicked; for they drop down trouble upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
My heart writhes within me; and the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
Fear and trembling have come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
And I said, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
Lo, I would wander far off; I would abide in the wilderness. Selah.
I would hasten my escape from the rushing wind and tempest.
Swallow up, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
Day and night they go around upon its walls; wickedness and trouble are also in its midst.
Lust is in its midst; oppression and guile do not depart from its streets.
For it is not an enemy who reproaches me, then I could bear it. It is not one who hates me who magnified himself against me, or I would hide myself from him;
but it is you, a man my equal, my friend and acquaintance.
We took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in the throng.
Let death seize them, and let them go down alive into Sheol; for evil is among them and in their dwellings.
As for me, I will call upon God, and Jehovah will deliver me.
Evening and morning and at noon I meditate and am in a stir; and He will hear my voice.
He has delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; for there were many against me.
The Mighty God will hear and testify to them, even He who abides from of old. Selah. Because they do not change, therefore they do not fear God.
He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has broken his covenant.
His flattery has been with forked tongue, and war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
Cast your burden upon Jehovah, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to totter.
But You, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in You.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Jonathelemrechokim. Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath]</b> -- Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up. Fighting daily, he oppresses me.
My enemies have panted after me daily; for they are many who proudly fight against me.
When I am afraid I trust in You.
In God (I praise His Word), in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.
All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
They stir up strife; they hide themselves; they watch my steps as they lie in wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God!
You have kept an account of my wanderings; O put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your Book.
When I cry out, then my enemies shall be turned back. This I know, for God is with me.
In God (I praise His Word); in Jehovah (I praise His Word);
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.
Your vows are upon me, O God; I will give thanks unto You,
for You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, so that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
<b>[To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave]</b> -- Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; for my soul trusts in You. Yea, in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, until these calamities pass by.
I will cry out unto God Most High, unto the Mighty God who does all things for me.
He will send from Heaven, and deliver me from the reproaches of him who would swallow me up. Selah. God will send forth His mercy and His truth.
My soul is among lions; I lie among the sons of men who are on fire, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, they have fallen into it. Selah.
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
Awake, my honor! Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn.
I will give thanks unto You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will make music unto You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great to the heavens, and Your truth unto the clouds.
Be exalted above the heavens, O God; let Your glory be above all the earth.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David]</b> -- Do you indeed speak justice, O silent ones? Do you judge with equity, O sons of men?
Indeed, in heart you work injustice; you weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, speaking lies.
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, like the deaf cobra that stops its ear,
which will not heed the charmer’s voice, who charms so skillfully.
O God, break their teeth in their mouth; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Jehovah.
Let them flow away like waters that move along. When he bends his bow to shoot arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
Let them be as a snail that melts away; as a stillborn child of a woman, that has not seen the sun.
Before your pots can feel the thorns, whether green or glowing, He shall sweep it away.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
And man shall say, Truly, there is a reward for the righteous; truly, there is a God who judges in the earth.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Altaschith. Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him]</b> -- Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend me from those who rise up against me.
Rescue me from the workers of wickedness, and deliver me from men of blood.
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Jehovah.
They run and prepare themselves though there is no fault in me. Awake to meet me, and pay attention!
You therefore, O Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, awake and punish all the nations; do not be merciful to any wicked traitors. Selah.
They return at evening; they growl like a dog, and go all around the city.
Behold, they belch with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for they say, Who hears?
But You, O Jehovah, shall laugh at them; You will have all the nations in derision.
I wait upon You, O my Strength; for God is my refuge.
The God of my mercy shall go before me; God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies.
Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
Let them be taken in their pride for the sin of their mouth and the word of their lips, along with the cursing and the lying which they speak.
Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they may not be; and let them know that God rules in Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah.
And at evening when they return, let them growl like a dog, and go all around the city.
Let them wander up and down for food, and pass the night unsatisfied.
But I will sing of Your power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning; for You have been my stronghold and refuge in the day of my distress.
To You, O my Strength, I will make music; for God is my stronghold and the God of my mercy.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Shushaneduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he struggled with Syrian Naharaim and with Syrian Maachah, when Joab returned and struck twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt]</b> -- O God, You have cast us off, You have broken us, You were angry; bring us back.
You have made the earth tremble; You split it open. Heal its breaks, for it is shaking.
You have shown Your people hard things; You have made us drink the wine of staggering.
You have given a banner to those who fear You, to flee to before truth. Selah.
That Your beloved may be rescued, deliver with Your right hand and respond to me.
God has spoken in His holiness: I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and measure out the valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the refuge of My head; Judah is My lawgiver;
Moab is My washpot; over Edom will I cast off My shoe; Philistia, shout in triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Have not You, O God, cast us off? And will not You, O God, go out with our armies?
Give us help from distress; for the help of man is vain.
Through God we shall do mightily; for it is He who will trample our enemies.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Neginah. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Hear my cry, O God; give attention to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth I cry out to You when my heart is faint; lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.
For You have been a shelter for me, a strong tower before the enemy.
I will dwell in Your tent forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given an inheritance to those who fear Your name.
You will add days to the days of the king; his years unto generations and generations.
He shall abide before God forever; appoint mercy and truth to preserve him.
So I will make music unto Your name forever, so that I may daily make good my vows.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Only before God is my soul silent; from Him comes my salvation.
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my stronghold; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will you assail a man? You shall be slain, all of you, like a bowing wall and a tottering fence.
Surely they have plotted to cast him down from his high position; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
My soul, be still only before God; for my expectation is from Him.
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my stronghold; I shall not be shaken.
In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength; my refuge is in God.
Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.
Surely the sons of men are a vapor; men are a lie; if they were to climb up into the scales, they are altogether lighter than vapor.
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery; if riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.
God has spoken once, twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God.
Also to You, O Jehovah, belongs mercy; for You give to every man according to his work.
<b>[A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah]</b> -- O God, You are my Mighty God. I will seek You earnestly; my soul thirsts for You; my flesh longs for You, as in a dry and weary land, where there is no water.
I have seen You in the sanctuary, to look upon Your power and Your glory.
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise You.
So I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips,
when I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches.
Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.
My soul has clung to You; Your right hand upholds me.
But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall fall by the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone who swears by Him shall glory; but the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation; preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
Hide me from the counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity,
who sharpen their tongue like a sword. They have bent their bows to shoot their arrows; even bitter words,
so that they may shoot at the perfect one from a hiding place; suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.
They encourage themselves in an evil plan; they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who shall see them?
They devise injustice; they have finished searching out a plot. Yea, the inward part of man and the heart are unfathomable.
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly they shall be wounded.
So they shall stumble over their own tongues; everyone who sees them shall flee away.
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall prudently comprehend His works.
The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall trust in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm and Song of David]</b> -- Silence is praise to You, O God, in Zion; and unto You is a vow performed.
To You who hears prayer, all flesh comes.
Perverse speech has prevailed against me; as for our transgressions, You shall atone for them.
Blessed is the one whom You choose, and cause to draw near You. He shall dwell in Your courts; we shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, of Your holy temple.
By awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us, O God of our salvation; You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth and the sea, of those far away.
The mountains are established by Your strength, girded with might,
who stills the noise of the sea, the roar of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples.
And those who dwell in the remotest regions are afraid of Your signs; You make the goings forth of the morning and evening rejoice.
You visit the earth and water it; You greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; You provide their grain, for in this way You have prepared it.
You water its furrows with water; You deepen its ridges; You make it soft with showers; You bless the sprouting of it.
You crown the year with Your goodness, and Your trenches drip with fertility.
They trickle on the pastures of the wilderness; and the little hills are girded with rejoicing.
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
<b>[To the Chief Musician. A Psalm. A Song]</b> -- Shout for joy unto God, all the earth!
Make music to the honor of His name; make His praise glorious.
Say unto God, How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies cower before You.
All the earth shall bow down before You and sing unto You, and make music unto Your name. Selah.
Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His deeds toward the sons of men.
He has turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there we rejoiced in Him.
He rules by His power forever; His eyes keep watch over the nations; let not the rebels lift themselves up and exalt. Selah.
O bless our God, you peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard;
who gives our souls life, and does not allow our feet to slip.
For You have tried us, O God; You have refined us, as silver is refined.
You have brought us into the net; You have laid affliction upon our loins.
You have allowed men to ride over our heads; we have gone through fire and through water, but You have brought us out into plenty.
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will make good to You my vows,
which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in distress.
I will offer to You burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah.
Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will declare what He has done for my soul.
I cried out unto Him with my mouth, and He was lifted up in praise with my tongue.
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.
Surely God has heard; He has given attention to the voice of my prayer.
Blessed is God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me!
<b>[To the Chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm. A Song]</b> -- God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His face to shine upon us. Selah.
That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples give thanks to You, O God; let all the peoples give thanks to You.
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the peoples righteously and govern the nations on earth. Selah.
Let the peoples give thanks to You, O God; let all the peoples give thanks to You.
Then the earth shall yield its increase; and God, our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm or Song of David]</b> -- Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; let those also who hate Him flee before Him.
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
But the righteous are glad; they rejoice before God. Yes, let them exceedingly rejoice.
Sing unto God, make music unto His name; exalt Him who rides in the wilderness by His name YAH, and rejoice before Him.
In His holy dwelling God is a father to the fatherless, and a judge for the widows.
God causes those who are alone to live in households; He delivers those who are bound into prosperity; but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
O God, when You went out before Your people, when You marched through the wilderness; Selah:
The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
You, O God, sent a plentiful rain, by which You established Your inheritance when it was weary.
Your community has dwelt in it; You, O God, have provided from Your goodness for the poor.
The Lord gave the Word; great was the host of those who proclaimed it.
Kings of armies fled, they fled away; and she who stayed at home divided the spoils.
When you lie down among the sheepfolds, you shall be like the wings of a dove covered with silver, and its pinions with yellow gold.
When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it snowed in Salmon.
Mount Bashan is God’s mountain; Mount Bashan is a mountain of peaks.
Why do you gaze in envy, O mountain peaks, at the mountain where God desires to dwell? Yes, Jehovah will abide in it forever.
The chariots of God are a vast innumerable number, thousands of thousands; the Lord is among them as at Sinai, in the Holy Place.
You have gone up on high; You have led captivity captive; You have received gifts for men, yes, even for the rebellious; that YAH God might dwell among them.
Blessed is the Lord who day by day bears our burdens, the Mighty God of our salvation! Selah.
Our Mighty God is the God of salvation; and unto Jehovah the Lord belong the escapes from death.
But God shall wound the head of His enemies, and the hairy head of him who walks on in his guilt.
The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan; I will bring back My people from the depths of the sea;
so that your foot may shatter your enemies in blood, and the tongue of your dogs may lap it.
They have seen Your goings, O God; the goings of my Mighty God, my King, in the sanctuary.
The singers went before, then those playing instruments followed; among them were the maidens playing the timbrels.
Bless God in the congregations, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the leaders of Judah and their multitude, the leaders of Zebulun, and the leaders of Naphtali.
Your God has commanded your strength; O God, be strong in that which You have done for us.
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem, kings shall bring presents unto You.
Rebuke the beasts of the reeds, the community of the bullheaded with the calves of the peoples, trampling with pieces of silver. Scatter the people who delight in war.
Ambassadors shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hurry with gifts in her hands unto God.
Sing unto God, you kingdoms of the earth; O make music unto the Lord. Selah.
To Him who rides on the Heavens of heavens from antiquity; lo, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.
Ascribe strength unto God over Israel; His majesty and His strength in the clouds.
O God, You are awesome out of Your sanctuary; the Mighty God of Israel is He who gives strength and power to the people. Blessed is God.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Shoshannim. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Deliver me, O God; for the waters have come in upon my soul!
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I have come into deep waters, where the floods have overflowed me.
I am weary from my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
They who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; my deceitful enemies who would destroy me are mighty. I am made to bring back what I did not take away.
O God, You know my folly, and my guilt is not hidden from You.
Do not let those who wait upon You, O Lord Jehovah of Hosts, be ashamed because of me; let not those who seek You be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel,
because I have borne reproach for Your sake, shame has covered my face.
I have become a stranger to My brothers, and a foreigner to My mother’s children.
For the zeal of Your house has eaten Me up; and the reproaches of those who reproached You have fallen upon Me.
When I wept in my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.
I also made sackcloth my clothing, and I became a byword to them.
Those who sit in the gate speak against me, and I am the taunting song of the drunkards.
But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Jehovah, in a favorable time; O God, in the multitude of Your mercies hear me, in the truth of Your salvation.
Rescue me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be rescued from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
Do not let the flood of waters overflow me, nor let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
Hear me, O Jehovah, for Your lovingkindness is good; turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.
And hide not Your face from Your servant; for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.
Draw near to My soul, and redeem it; deliver Me because of My enemies.
You have known My reproach, and My shame, and My dishonor; My enemies are all before You.
Reproach has broken My heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for someone to show pity, but there was no one; and for comforters, but I found none.
They also gave Me gall for my food; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.
Let their table become a snare before them; and to those at peace, a trap.
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see; and make their loins shake continually.
Pour out Your indignation upon them, and let Your burning anger take hold of them.
Let their dwelling place be desolate; let no one dwell in their tents.
For they have persecuted the ones whom You have stricken, and they talk to the grief of those You pierced.
Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into Your righteousness.
Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life, and not be written with the righteous.
But I am lowly and in pain; let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
This also shall please Jehovah better than an ox or a bull that has horns and hooves.
The lowly shall see and be glad; and your heart shall live, you who seek God.
For Jehovah hears the needy, and does not despise His prisoners.
Let the heavens and earth praise Him, the seas, and everything that moves in them.
For God will deliver Zion, and will build the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it.
And the seed of His servants shall inherit it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance]</b> -- Make haste, O God, to rescue me; make haste to help me, O Jehovah.
Let them be ashamed and abashed, those who seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and dishonored, those who desire my hurt.
Let them be turned back as a consequence of their shame, those who say, Aha, aha!
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; and let those who love Your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
But I am lowly and needy; make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Jehovah, do not delay!
In You, O Jehovah, I put my trust; let me never be put to shame.
Rescue me in Your righteousness, and cause me to escape; extend Your ear to me, and save me.
Be a rock of refuge for me, to which I may continually go; You have given command to save me, for You are my Rock and my Fortress.
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
For You are my hope, O Lord Jehovah, my trust from my youth.
Upon You I have been supported from the womb; You are He who took me out of my mother’s belly; my praise shall continually be of You.
I am like a wonder to many, but You are my strong refuge.
Let my mouth be filled with Your praise, with Your glory all the day.
Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
For my enemies speak against me; and those who lie in wait for my soul take counsel together,
saying, God has forsaken him; pursue and take him, for there is no one to rescue him.
O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!
Let them be ashamed; let those who are enemies of my soul be consumed; let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek my hurt.
But I will hope continually, and I have praised You again and again.
My mouth shall recount Your righteousness and Your salvation all the day; for I do not know their number.
I will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah; I will keep in remembrance Your righteousness; Yours alone.
O God, You have taught me from my youth; and to this day I have declared Your marvelous works.
And now when I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not leave me, until I have declared Your strength to this generation, and Your power to everyone who is to come.
Your righteousness also, O God, is very high, You who have done great things. O God, who is like You,
who has shown me great and evil distresses. You will revive me again, and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
You will increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
I will also give thanks unto You with the lute, O my God, for Your faithfulness. To You I will make music with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I make music unto You, and my soul, which You have redeemed.
My tongue also shall meditate on Your righteousness all day long; for those who seek evil upon me are abashed; they are brought to shame.
<b>[A Psalm for Solomon]</b> -- Give the king Your justice, O God, and Your righteousness to the king’s Son.
He will judge Your people in righteousness, and Your lowly with justice.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
He shall execute justice for the lowly of the people; He shall save the children of the needy, and shall crush in pieces the oppressor.
They shall fear You as long as the sun and moon endure, from generation to generation.
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, like showers that water the earth.
In His days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.
He shall also have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him; and His enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.
For He shall deliver the needy when he cries, and the lowly who has no helper.
He shall have pity on the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy.
He shall redeem their soul from oppression and violence; and their blood shall be precious in His sight.
And He shall live, and to Him shall be given the gold of Sheba; and prayer shall continually be made for Him; He shall be blessed daily.
There shall be an abundance of grain in the earth on the top of the mountains; its fruit shall shake like Lebanon, and those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
His name is eternal; His name shall continue and increase before the sun; and men shall be blessed in Him; all nations shall call Him blessed.
Blessed is Jehovah God, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things.
And blessed is His glorious name forever; let all the earth be filled with His glory! Amen and Amen.
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
<b>[A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- Truly God is good to Israel, to the pure of heart.
But as for me, my foot had almost stumbled; my steps had nearly slipped.
For I was jealous of the boastful, when I saw the peace of the wicked.
For there are no bonds in their death; but their belly is fat.
They are not in trouble like other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them like a garment.
Their eyes bulge with fatness; they have more than the heart could imagine.
They scoff and speak of evil oppression; they speak arrogantly.
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth.
Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full cup are drained out to them.
And they say, How does the Mighty God know? and, Is there knowledge in the Most High?
Behold, these are the wicked, who are continually at ease; they increase in riches.
Surely I have made my heart pure in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.
For all day long I have been plagued, and chastened every morning.
If I had said, I will speak thus; behold, I would have deceived a generation of Your sons.
When I thought deeply in order to understand this, it was troublesome to me,
until I went into the sanctuary of the Mighty God; then I understood their end.
Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to desolation.
How have they been brought to desolation, as in a moment! They are fully brought to an end with destruction,
like a dream when one awakes; so, O Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image.
For my heart was grieved and I was pierced to the core.
I was so foolish and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.
Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have held me by my right hand.
You will lead me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
Whom have I in Heaven besides You? And there is no one I desire on earth.
My flesh and my heart waste away; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion forever.
For lo, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who go whoring away from You.
But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah, to declare all Your works.
<b>[Maschil of Asaph]</b> -- O God, have You cast us off forever? Will Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?
Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, the scepter of Your inheritance which You have redeemed; this mount Zion in which You have dwelt.
Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations, even all the evil the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; they set up their banners for signs.
They are known for bringing their axes against the thick trees.
And now all its engravings they strike down with axes and hammers.
They have set fire to Your sanctuary; they have defiled to the ground the dwelling place of Your name.
They said in their hearts, Together let us violently oppress them. They have burned up all the meeting places of the Mighty God in the land.
We do not see our signs; there is no prophet any more; neither is there among us any who knows how long.
O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?
Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? From your bosom, draw it out of Your bosom and exterminate them.
For God is my King of old, working deliverance in the midst of the earth.
You have divided the sea by Your strength; You have broken the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
You have crushed the heads of leviathan, and given him to be food to the people living in the wilderness.
You have cleaved open the fountain and the flood; You have dried up mighty rivers.
The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun.
You have established all the borders of the earth; You have made summer and winter.
Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Jehovah, and that the foolish people have blasphemed Your name.
O do not deliver the soul of Your turtle dove to the beasts; forget not the community of Your lowly forever.
Have regard to the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the abode of violence.
O let not the oppressed return ashamed; let the lowly and needy praise Your name.
Arise, O God, plead Your own case; remember the daily reproaches of the fool.
Forget not the voice of Your enemies; the roar of those who rise up against You continually increases.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Altaschith. A Psalm or Song of Asaph]</b> -- Unto You, O God, we have given thanks, unto You we have given thanks; for Your wondrous works have declared that Your name is near.
When I choose the appointed time, I will judge with equity.
The earth and all its inhabitants are melting away; I have meted out its pillars. Selah.
I said to the boastful, Do not deal boastfully; and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn;
do not lift up your horn on high; nor speak with a stiff neck.
For exaltation comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.
For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is fully mixed; and He pours out from it; but the dregs of it, all the wicked of the earth shall drain its dregs and drink.
But I will declare forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
I will also cut off all the horns of the wicked; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Neginoth. A Psalm or Song of Asaph]</b> -- In Judah God is known; His name is great in Israel.
In Salem also is His covert, and His dwelling place in Zion.
There He broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield and sword, and the battle. Selah
You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
The stouthearted were plundered; they have become drowsy and fallen asleep; and none of the mighty men have found their hands.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
You, Yourself, are to be feared; and who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?
You caused judgment to be heard from Heaven; the earth feared and was still,
when God arose to justice, to deliver all the lowly of the earth. Selah
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; with the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.
Vow unto Jehovah your God, and make good; let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who is to be feared.
He shall cut off the spirit of princes; He is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- I cried out unto God with my voice; unto God with my voice; and He gave ear unto me.
In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; my hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit fainted. Selah
You have held my eyelids open; I am so disturbed that I cannot speak.
I have considered the days of old, the years of antiquity.
I call to remembrance my song in the night; I meditate within my heart, and my spirit makes diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be pleased no more?
Has His mercy come to an end forever? Has His Word failed from generation to generation?
Has the Mighty God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah
And I said, This is my weakness; the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will remember the works of YAH; surely I will remember Your wonders of old.
I will also meditate on all Your works, and talk of Your deeds.
Your way, O God, is in holiness; who is so great a Mighty God as our God?
You are the Mighty God who does wonders; you have declared Your strength among the peoples.
You have with Your arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You, they were afraid; the depths also trembled.
The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also went here and there.
The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps have not been known.
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
<b>[Maschil of Asaph]</b> -- Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; extend your ears to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,
which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
We will not hide them from their children, recounting to the following generation the praises of Jehovah, and His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.
For He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers, that they should declare them to their children;
that the following generation might know them, the children who would be born, that they might arise and recount them to their children,
that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of the Mighty God, but keep His commandments;
and might not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not set its heart aright, and whose spirit has not been faithful to the Mighty God.
The sons of Ephraim, being armed to shoot with their bows, turned back in the day of battle.
They did not keep the Covenant of God; they refused to walk in His Law,
and forgot His works and His wonders that He had shown them.
He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through; and He made the waters stand up like a heap.
In the daytime also He led them with the cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
He split the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink in abundance from the depths.
He also brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
But they sinned even more against Him by rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
And they tested the Mighty God in their heart by asking for food for the lust of their soul.
Yes, they spoke against God: They said, Can the Mighty God set a table in the wilderness?
Behold, He struck the rock, so that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can He give bread also? Can He provide flesh for His people?
Therefore Jehovah heard this and was furious; so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel,
because they did not believe in God, and did not trust in His salvation;
though He had commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of the heavens,
had rained down manna upon them to eat, and given them of the grain of the heavens.
Men ate the bread of the mighty; He sent them food to the full.
He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; and by His power He brought in the south wind.
He also rained flesh upon them like the dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas;
and He let them fall into the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
So they ate and were abundantly satisfied, for He gave them their own desire.
They were not deprived of their lust; but while their food was still in their mouths,
the wrath of God came upon them, and killed the fattest of them, and struck down the choice men of Israel.
For all this they still sinned, and did not believe in His wondrous works.
Therefore He brought an end to their days in vanity, and their years in dismay.
When He killed them, then they sought after Him; and they returned and sought earnestly for the Mighty God.
Then they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God was the One who redeemed them.
Nevertheless they deceived Him with their mouths, and they lied to Him with their tongues;
for their heart was not steadfast with Him, nor were they faithful in His covenant.
But He, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity, and did not destroy them; yea, many a time He turned His anger away, and did not stir up all His wrath;
for He remembered that they were but flesh, a breath that passes away and does not come again.
How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert!
Yea, they turned back and tempted the Mighty God, and troubled the Holy One of Israel.
They did not remember His hand, the day when He ransomed them from the enemy,
when He brought to pass His signs in Egypt, and His wonders in the fields of Zoan;
turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.
He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
He also gave up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to lightning.
He cast upon them His burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, by sending evil angels.
He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the plague,
and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the first of their strength in the tents of Ham.
But He made His own people go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;
and He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
And He brought them to the border of His sanctuary, this mountain which His right hand had acquired.
He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them an inheritance by a surveyor’s line, and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.
Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, and did not keep His Testimonies,
but turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.
When God heard this, He was angry, and greatly despised Israel,
so that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which He had placed among men,
and delivered His strength into captivity, and His glory into the enemy’s hand.
He also gave His people over to the sword, and was angry with His inheritance.
The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given in marriage.
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep, like a mighty man overcome with wine.
And He struck His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach.
Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
but chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved.
And He built His sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which He has founded forever.
He also chose David His servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
from following the ewes nursing their young He brought him, to shepherd Jacob His people, and Israel His inheritance.
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
<b>[A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance; Your holy temple they have defiled; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
The dead bodies of Your servants they have given as food for the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to those who are around us.
How long, Jehovah? Will You be angry forever? Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that have not known You, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Your name.
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Oh, do not remember our former iniquities against us! Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us, for we have been brought very low.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name; and rescue us, and make atonement for our sins, for Your name’s sake!
Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let it be known among the nations in our sight, the avenging of the blood of Your servants which has been shed.
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power preserve alive the children of death;
and return upon our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.
So we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture, will continually give You thanks; we will show forth Your praise from generation to generation.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Shoshannimeduth. A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!
Stir up Your strength before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh and come and save us!
Bring us back, O God, and cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!
O Jehovah the God of Hosts, how long will You be angry against the prayer of Your people?
You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink a third time.
You make us an object of contention to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
Bring us back, O God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!
You have brought a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations and planted it.
You have cleared away for it, and caused the roots to take root, and it filled the land.
The hills were covered with its shade, and its boughs were like mighty cedars.
It sent out its boughs to the Sea, and its branches to the River.
Why have You broken down its hedges, so that all who pass by the way pluck its fruit?
The boar out of the woods tears it up, and the wild beast of the field devours it.
Return, we beseech You, O God of Hosts; look down from Heaven and look upon and visit this vine,
and the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and the son that You made strong for Yourself.
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of Your face.
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, upon the son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself.
Then we will not turn back from You; revive us, and we will call upon Your name.
Turn us back, O Jehovah the God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved!
<b>[To the chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob.
Raise a song; bring out the timbrel, the pleasant harp and lute.
Blow the shofar at the new moon, at the full moon, on our solemn feast day.
For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
This He has ordained in Joseph as a testimony, when He went throughout the land of Egypt, where I heard a language I did not understand.
I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands left the pots.
You called in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
Hear, O My people, and I will testify to you! O Israel, if you will listen to Me:
There shall be no strange god among you; nor shall you bow down to any foreign god.
I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt; open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
But My people would not heed My voice, and Israel would have none of Me.
So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart, to walk in their own counsels.
Oh, that My people had listened to Me, that Israel had walked in My ways!
I would soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand against their adversaries.
The haters of Jehovah would have cowered before Him, and their time would have endured forever.
He would have fed them also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock I would have satisfied you.
<b>[A Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods.
How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked? Selah
Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked.
They do not know, nor do they understand; they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I have said, You gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.
But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for You shall inherit all nations.
<b>[A Song or Psalm of Asaph]</b> -- Do not keep silent, O God! Do not hold Your peace, and do not be still, O Mighty God!
For lo, Your enemies roar; and those who hate You have lifted up their head.
They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, and conspired against Your treasure.
They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.
For they have consulted together with one heart; they covenant an alliance against You:
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites;
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
Assyria also has joined with them; they have helped the sons of Lot. Selah
Deal with them as with Midian, as with Sisera, as with Jabin at the Brook Kishon,
who perished at En Dor, who became as dung upon the land.
Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, yea, all their anointed like Zebah and Zalmunna,
who have said, Let us take for ourselves the pastures of God for a possession.
O my God, make them like the whirling dust, like the chaff before the wind!
As the fire burns the forest, and as the flame sets the mountains on fire,
so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.
Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O Jehovah.
Let them be ashamed and dismayed forever; yea, let them be abashed and perish,
that they may know that You, whose name alone is Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth.
<b>[To the chief Musician. Gittith. A Psalm for the sons of Korah]</b> -- How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Jehovah of Hosts!
My soul longs, yea, is spent for the courts of Jehovah; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living Mighty God.
Even the sparrow has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; even Your altars, O Jehovah of Hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will still praise You. Selah
Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, whose heart is upon Your highways.
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a spring; the early rain also covers it with blessings.
They go from strength to strength, appearing before God in Zion.
O Jehovah the God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah
Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of Your anointed.
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
For Jehovah God is a sun and shield; Jehovah will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk in integrity.
O Jehovah of Hosts, blessed is the man who trusts in You!
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm for the sons of Korah]</b> -- Lord, You have been gracious to Your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.
You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sin. Selah
You have withdrawn all Your wrath; You have drawn back from Your burning anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and make a break in Your anger toward us.
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger from generation to generation?
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?
Show us Your mercy, Jehovah, and grant us Your salvation.
I will hear what Jehovah the Mighty God will speak, for He will speak peace to His people and to His saints; but let them not turn back to folly.
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed.
Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from Heaven.
Yea, Jehovah will give good; and our land shall yield its increase.
Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall set us in the way of His steps.
<b>[A Prayer of David]</b> -- Extend Your ear, O Jehovah, hear me; for I am lowly and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am holy; You my God, save Your servant who trusts in You!
Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry out to You daily.
Make glad the soul of Your servant, for unto You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, and abounding in mercy unto all those who call upon You.
Give ear, O Jehovah, unto my prayer; and give attention to the voice of my supplications.
In the day of my distress I will call upon You, for You will answer me.
Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord; nor any like Your works.
All nations whom You have made shall come and bow down before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your name;
for You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God.
Teach me Your way, O Jehovah; I will walk in Your truth; unite my heart to fear Your name.
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Your name always.
For great is Your mercy toward me, and You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.
O God, the proud have risen against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set You before them.
But You, O Lord, are a Mighty God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.
O turn to me, and have mercy upon me! Give Your strength to Your servant, and deliver the son of Your handmaid.
Show me a sign for good, that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, because You, Jehovah, have helped me and comforted me.
<b>[A Psalm or Song for the sons of Korah]</b> -- His foundation is in the holy mountains.
Jehovah loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God! Selah
I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those who know me; behold, O Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this one was born there.
And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man have been born in her; and the Most High shall establish her.
Jehovah will take account, when He registers the peoples: This one was born there. Selah
Both the singers and the players on pipes say, All my springs are in you.
<b>[A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician. Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite]</b> -- O Jehovah the God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before You.
Let my prayer come before You; extend Your ear to my cry.
For my soul is full of evil, and my life draws near to Sheol.
I am reckoned with those who go down to the pit; I am like a man with no strength,
free among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom You remember no more, and who have been cut off from Your hand.
You have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the depths.
Your wrath has leaned upon me, and You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah
You have removed my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot go out;
my eye has become faint because of affliction. Jehovah, I have called daily upon You; I have stretched out my hands unto You.
Will You work wonders for the dead? Shall the dead arise and give thanks to You? Selah
Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon?
Shall Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
But unto You I have cried out, O Jehovah, and in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Jehovah, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me?
I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth; I have suffered Your terrors; I am perplexed.
Your fury has passed over me; Your terrors have cut me off.
They have encompassed me like water all day long; they have engulfed me altogether.
Lover and friend You have removed far from me, and my acquaintances into darkness.
<b>[Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite]</b> -- I will sing of the mercies of Jehovah forever; with my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness from generation to generation.
For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness You shall establish in the heavens.
I have made a covenant with My elect, I have sworn unto David My servant:
Your seed I will establish forever, and build up your throne from generation to generation. Selah
And the heavens shall confess Your wonders, O Jehovah; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints.
For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? Who among the sons of the gods can be likened unto Jehovah?
The Mighty God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, and to be held in reverence by all those around Him.
O Jehovah the God of Hosts, who is mighty like You, O YAH? Your faithfulness is round about You.
You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, You still them.
You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; You have founded the world and all its fullness.
The north and the south, You have created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name.
You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, and exalted is Your right hand.
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before Your face.
Blessed are the people who know the shouts of joy! They walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Your countenance.
In Your name they rejoice all day long, and in Your righteousness they are exalted.
For You are the glory of their strength, and in Your favor our horn is exalted.
For Jehovah is our shield, and our King, the Holy One of Israel.
Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one, and said: I have placed help upon a mighty one; I have exalted a chosen one out of the people.
I have found David, My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him;
with whom My hand shall be established; My arm also shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall not exact usury upon him, nor the son of injustice afflict him.
I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague those who hate him.
But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him, and in My name his horn shall be exalted.
I will also set his hand over the sea, and his right hand over the rivers.
He shall call unto Me, You are my Father, my Mighty God, and the Rock of my salvation.
And I will make him My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.
My mercy I will keep for him forever, and My covenant shall be established with him.
His seed also I have ordained eternally, and His throne as the days of Heaven.
If his sons forsake My Law and do not walk in My justice,
if they break My Statutes and do not keep My Commandments,
then I will punish their transgression with the rod, and their perversities with strokes.
Nevertheless in My lovingkindness I will not crush him, nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.
My covenant I will not break, nor alter what has gone forth out of My lips.
Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David:
His seed is forever, and his throne as the sun before Me;
it shall be established forever like the moon, a faithful witness in the clouds. Selah
But You have cast off and rejected, You have passed over Your anointed.
You have spurned the covenant of Your servant; You have dishonored his crown on the ground.
You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin.
All who pass by the way plunder him; he is a reproach to his neighbors.
You have exalted the right hand of his oppressors; You have made all his enemies rejoice.
You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and have not sustained him in the battle.
You have made his glory to cease, and hurled his throne down to the ground.
The days of his youth You have shortened; You have covered him with shame. Selah
How long, Jehovah? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your fury burn like fire?
Remember the time of life; why have you created the sons of men for vanity?
What strong man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
O Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses which You swore unto David in Your faithfulness?
Remember, O Lord, the reproaches of Your Servant, which I bear in My bosom, of all the many peoples,
with which Your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, with which they have reproached the heel of Your Anointed.
Blessed is Jehovah forevermore! Amen and Amen.
<b>[A Prayer of Moses the man of God]</b> -- O Lord, You have been our dwelling place from generation to generation.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are the Mighty God.
You return man to dust, and say, Return, O sons of men.
For a thousand years in Your sight are like yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
You carry them away like a flood; they are like a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up:
In the morning it blossoms and sprouts; in the evening it is cut down and dries up.
For we have been consumed by Your anger, and by Your wrath we have been terrified.
You have set our iniquities before You, our secrets in the light of Your countenance.
For all our days have turned away in Your wrath; we finish our years with a sigh.
The days of our years are seventy years; and if by reason of vigor they are eighty years, yet their boast is toil and wickedness; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Who knows the power of Your anger? For as is the fear of You, so is Your wrath.
So teach us to number our days, that we may bring about a heart of wisdom.
Return, O Jehovah! How long? And have compassion on Your servants.
O satisfy us early with Your mercy, that we may exult and be glad all our days!
Make us glad according to the days in which we have been afflicted, the years in which we have seen evil.
Let Your work appear unto Your servants, and Your glory unto their children.
And let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yea, establish the work of our hands.
He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him will I trust.
Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the destructive pestilence.
He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler.
You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day,
nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you.
Only with your eyes shall you look, and see the retribution of the wicked.
Because you have made Jehovah, who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place,
no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;
for He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.
In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.
You shall tread upon the lion and the viper, the young lion and the dragon you shall trample underfoot.
Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him.
With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.
<b>[A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day]</b> -- It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, and to make music to Your name, O Most High;
to declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night,
on an instrument of ten strings, on the lute, and on the harp, with resounding music.
For You, Jehovah, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands.
O Jehovah, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep.
A brutish man does not know, nor does a fool understand this.
When the wicked spring up like grass, and when all the workers of iniquity blossom, it is that they may be destroyed forever.
But You, Jehovah, are on high forever.
For lo, Your enemies, O Jehovah, for lo, Your enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
But my horn You have exalted like an oryx; I have been anointed with fresh oil.
My eye also shall see my desire upon my enemies; my ears shall hear my desire upon the wicked who rise up against me.
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God.
They shall still bear fruit in old age; they shall be fat and luxuriant;
to declare that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
Jehovah reigns, He is clothed with majesty; Jehovah is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. The world also is established, so that it cannot be shaken.
Your throne is established from of old; You are from eternity.
The streams have lifted up, O Jehovah, the streams have lifted up their sound; the streams lift up their waves.
Jehovah on high is mightier than the sound of many waters, than the mighty breakers of the sea.
Your Testimonies are very sure; holiness befits Your house, O Jehovah, to the length of days.
O Jehovah, Mighty God, to whom vengeance belongs; O Mighty God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth!
Be exalted, O Judge of the earth; restore recompense to the proud.
Jehovah, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
They belch forth, and speak arrogant things; all the workers of iniquity boast in themselves.
They crush Your people, O Jehovah, and afflict Your heritage.
They slay the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.
Yet they say, YAH does not see, nor does the God of Jacob perceive it.
Understand, you stupid ones among the people; and you fools, when will you be wise?
He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see?
He who chastens the nations, shall He not correct, He who teaches man knowledge?
Jehovah knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
Blessed is the man whom You correct, O YAH, and teach out of Your Law,
that You may give him rest from the evil days, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
For Jehovah will not cast off His people, nor will He forsake His inheritance.
But justice shall return to righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless Jehovah had been my help, my soul would shortly have dwelt in silence.
If I had said, My foot slips, Your mercy, O Jehovah, holds me up.
In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul.
Shall the throne of iniquity, which fashions trouble by decree, have fellowship with You?
They gather together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
But Jehovah has been my defense, and my God the rock of my refuge.
He brings upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own evil; Jehovah our God shall cut them off.
Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah! Let us shout joyfully unto the Rock of our salvation.
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.
For Jehovah is the great and Mighty God, and the great King above all gods.
In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the summits of the hills are also His.
The sea is His, for He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.
Oh come, let us prostrate ourselves and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice:
harden not your hearts, as in the strife, as in the day of testing in the wilderness,
when your fathers tried Me; they examined Me and saw My work.
For forty years I was grieved with that generation, and said, It is a people who go astray in their hearts, and they have not known My ways.
So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.
Oh, sing unto Jehovah a new song! Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth.
Sing unto Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples.
For Jehovah is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Jehovah made the heavens.
Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
Ascribe unto Jehovah, O families of the peoples, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength.
Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts.
O bow down before Jehovah in the beauty of holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth.
Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; the world also is firmly established, it shall not be shaken; He shall judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and all its fullness;
let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the forests shall rejoice before Jehovah.
For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.
Jehovah reigns; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of the islands be glad!
Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.
A fire goes before Him and burns up His enemies round about.
His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Jehovah, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
The heavens declare His righteousness, and all the peoples see His glory.
Let all be put to shame who serve graven images, who boast of idols. Bow down before Him, all you gods.
Zion has heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O Jehovah.
For You, Jehovah, are most high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.
You who love Jehovah, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
O sing unto Jehovah a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have given Him the victory.
Jehovah has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has laid bare in the eyes of the nations.
He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Shout joyfully unto Jehovah, all the earth; break forth with praise, and make music.
Make music unto Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody,
with trumpets and the sound of a shofar; shout joyfully before Jehovah, the King.
Let the sea roar, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell in it;
let the rivers clap their hands; let the hills be joyful together before Jehovah,
for He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples with equity.
Jehovah reigns; let the peoples tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; let the earth quake!
Jehovah is great in Zion, and He has been exalted above all the peoples.
Let them praise Your great and awesome name; it is holy.
The King’s strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt Jehovah our God, and bow down at His footstool; He is holy.
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called upon His name; they called upon Jehovah, and He answered them.
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the statutes He gave them.
You answered them, O Jehovah our God; You were to them the Mighty God who forgives, though You took vengeance on their deeds.
Exalt Jehovah our God, and bow down at His holy hill; for Jehovah our God is holy.
<b>[A Psalm of Thanksgiving]</b> -- Shout joyfully unto Jehovah, all you lands!
Serve Jehovah with gladness; come before His presence with joyful voice.
Know that Jehovah, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise. Be thankful unto Him, and bless His name.
For Jehovah is good; His mercy is eternal, and His truth endures from generation to generation.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- I will sing of mercy and justice; unto You, O Jehovah, will I make music.
I will behave wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know evil.
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, I will annihilate; the one who has a haughty look and a proud heart, I will not endure.
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in a perfect way shall serve me.
He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house; he who tells lies shall not be established in my sight.
Early will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the doers of wickedness from the city of Jehovah.
<b>[A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Jehovah]</b> -- Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, and let my cry come unto You.
Hide not Your face from me in the day of my distress; extend Your ear to me; in the day that I call, answer me speedily.
For my days have vanished like smoke, and my bones are burned like a firebrand.
My heart is stricken and dried up like grass, so that I forget to eat my bread.
Because of the sound of my groaning my bones cling to my skin.
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.
I am wakeful, and am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.
My enemies reproach me all day long, those who are mad at me swear an oath against me.
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
because of Your indignation and Your wrath; for You have taken me up and cast me away.
My days are like a shadow that lengthens, and I am dried up like grass.
But You, O Jehovah, shall endure forever, and Your remembrance from generation to generation.
You will arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favor her, yea, the set time, has come.
For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and show favor to her dust.
So the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth Your glory.
For Jehovah shall build up Zion; He shall appear in His glory.
He shall turn toward the prayer of the destitute, and shall not despise their prayer.
This shall be written for the following generation, that a people yet to be created may praise YAH.
For He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from Heaven Jehovah has looked upon the earth,
to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to set free the children of death,
to declare the name of Jehovah in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem,
when the peoples and kingdoms are gathered together to serve Jehovah.
He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.
I said, O my Mighty God, do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are from generation to generation.
Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
They shall perish, but You will endure; yea, they shall all grow old like a garment; like clothing You will change them, and they shall be changed;
but You are the same, and Your years shall not be consumed.
The children of Your servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before Your face.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Bless Jehovah, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name!
Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits:
Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases,
who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,
who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
Jehovah executes righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel.
Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.
He will not always strive with us, nor will He keep His anger forever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us according to our iniquities.
For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
As a father has compassion on his children, so Jehovah has compassion on those who fear Him.
For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.
As for man, his days are like grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes.
And then the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place is noticed no more.
But the mercy of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear Him, and His righteousness unto children’s children,
to such as keep His covenant, and to those who remember His Commandments to do them.
Jehovah has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all.
Bless Jehovah, you His angels, who excel in strength, who do His Word, heeding the voice of His Word.
Bless Jehovah, all you His hosts, you ministers of His, who do His pleasure.
Bless Jehovah, all His works, in all places of His dominion. Bless Jehovah, O my soul!
Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, You are very great: You are clothed with honor and majesty,
who covers Yourself with light as with a garment, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,
who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters, who makes the clouds His chariot, who walks on the wings of the wind,
who makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire.
You laid the foundations of the earth, so that it should not be shaken forever.
You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
At Your rebuke they fled; at the voice of Your thunder they hurried away.
They went up over the mountains; they went down into the valleys, to the place which You have founded for them.
You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, that they may not return to cover the earth.
He sends the springs into the valleys, they flow among the hills.
They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.
Over them the birds of the heavens have their dwelling; they utter their voices among the branches.
He waters the hills from His upper chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.
He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth,
and wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread which strengthens man’s heart.
The trees of Jehovah are full, the cedars of Lebanon which He planted,
where the birds make their nests; the fir trees, where the stork has her house.
The high hills are for the wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the hyrax.
He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knows its setting.
You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the beasts of the forest creep about.
The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their food from the Mighty God.
When the sun rises, they gather together and lie down in their dens.
Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.
O Jehovah, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions;
this great and wide sea, in which are innumerable creeping things, living things both small and great.
There the ships go; there is that leviathan which You have fashioned to play in it.
These all wait upon You, that You may give them their food in due season.
What You give them they gather in; You open Your hand, they are filled with good.
You hide Your face, they are dismayed; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; and You renew the face of the earth.
The glory of Jehovah is eternal; Jehovah shall rejoice in His works.
He looks upon the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke.
I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live; I will make music unto my God while I have my being.
My meditation of Him shall be pleasant; I will be glad in Jehovah.
Let sinners be consumed from off the earth, and the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul! Praise YAH!
Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah! Call upon His name; make known His deeds among the people!
Sing unto Him, make music unto Him; talk of all His wondrous works!
Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those rejoice who seek Jehovah!
Seek Jehovah and His strength; seek His face continually!
Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the justice of His mouth,
O seed of Abraham His servant, you children of Jacob, His elect.
He is Jehovah our God; His justice is in all the earth.
He remembers His covenant forever, the Word which He commanded, to a thousand generations,
the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac,
and confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel as a perpetual covenant,
saying: To you will I give the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance;
when they were but a few men in number, yea very few, and sojourned in it.
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people,
He permitted no one to do them wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sakes,
saying, Do not touch My anointed, and do My prophets no harm.
Moreover He called for a famine in the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.
He sent a man before them; Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
They hurt his feet with fetters, he was laid in irons,
until the time that his word came to pass. The Word of Jehovah had refined him.
The king sent and released him, the ruler of the people let him go free.
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions,
to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
He increased His people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.
He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants.
He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen.
They performed His signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they did not rebel against His Word.
He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
Their land brought forth frogs in swarms, even in the chambers of their kings.
He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats in all their territory.
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
He struck their vines also, and their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their territory.
He spoke, and locusts came, caterpillars without number,
and ate up all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their vigor.
He also brought them out with silver and gold, and there was no one feeble among their tribes.
Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen upon them.
He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light at night.
They asked, and He brought quail, and satisfied them with the bread of Heaven.
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; it ran in the dry places like a river.
For He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant.
He brought out His people with joy, His elect with gladness.
He gave them the lands of the nations, and they inherited the labor of the peoples,
that they might keep His statutes and guard His Laws. Praise YAH!
Praise YAH! O give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good! For His mercy is eternal.
Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Who can proclaim all His praise?
Blessed are those who keep justice, and he who does righteousness at all times.
Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor of Your people; O visit me with Your salvation,
that I may see the good of Your elect, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; they did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, but rebelled by the sea; the Red Sea.
Nevertheless He delivered them for His name’s sake, that He might make His mighty power known.
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up; so He led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
He delivered them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
The waters covered their enemies; there was not one of them left.
Then they believed His Words; they sang His praise.
They soon forgot His works; they did not wait for His counsel,
but lusted with desire in the wilderness, and tempted the Mighty God in the desert.
And He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
When they envied Moses in the camp, and Aaron the saint of Jehovah,
the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
They made a calf in Horeb, and bowed down to the molten image.
Thus they changed their Glory into the image of an ox that eats grass.
They forgot the Mighty God their Deliverer, who had done great things in Egypt,
wondrous works in the land of Ham, awesome things by the Red Sea.
Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His elect stood before Him in the breach, to turn away His wrath, so that He should not destroy them.
Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe His Word,
but murmured in their tents, and did not heed the voice of Jehovah.
Therefore He raised up His hand and swore against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,
to overthrow their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
They joined themselves also to Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices to the dead.
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, and the plague broke out upon them.
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was restrained.
And it was accounted to him for righteousness from generation to generation forevermore.
They angered Him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses on account of them;
because they rebelled against His Spirit, so that he spoke rashly with his lips.
They did not destroy the peoples as Jehovah had commanded them,
but they mingled with the nations and learned their works;
they served their idols, which were a snare to them.
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,
and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.
Thus they were defiled with their own works, and went whoring with their deeds.
Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against His people, so that He abhorred His own inheritance.
And He gave them into the hand of the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were humbled under their hand.
Many times He delivered them; but they rebelled in their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, when He heard their cry;
and remembered His covenant toward them, and was moved to compassion according to the abundance of His mercies.
He also gave them compassion before the faces of those who had taken them captive.
Deliver us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks to Your holy name, to triumph in Your praise.
Blessed is Jehovah the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise YAH!
Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy is eternal.
Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way; they found no city to dwell in.
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He rescued them out of their distresses.
And He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city for a dwelling place.
Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!
For He satisfies the longing soul, and fills the hungry soul with good.
Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and irons;
because they rebelled against the Words of the Mighty God, and despised the counsel of the Most High;
therefore He humbled their heart with labor; they fell down, and there was no one to help.
Then they cried out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivered them out of their distresses.
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke and tore their bonds apart.
Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!
For He has broken the gates of bronze, and cut the bars of iron in two.
Fools, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
Their soul abhors all kinds of food, and they draw near to the gates of death.
Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He delivers them out of their distresses.
He sent His Word and healed them, and delivered them from the pit.
Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!
Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare His works with rejoicing.
Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business on great waters,
they see the works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep.
For He commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves.
They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths; their soul melts because it is bad.
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.
Then they cry out unto Jehovah in their adversity, and He brings them out of their distresses.
He calms the storm, so that its waves are still.
Then they are glad because they are quiet; so He guides them to their desired haven.
Oh, that men would give thanks unto Jehovah for His goodness, and for His wonderful works to the sons of men!
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the company of the elders.
He turns rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into thirsty ground;
a fruitful land into barrenness, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it.
He turns a wilderness into pools of water, and dry land into watersprings.
There He makes the hungry dwell, that they may establish a city for a dwelling place,
and sow fields and plant vineyards, that they may yield a fruitful crop.
He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly; and He does not let their cattle decrease.
When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction and sorrow,
He pours contempt upon nobles, and causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no path;
yet He exalts the poor out of affliction, and makes their families like a flock.
The upright see it and rejoice, and all iniquity stops its mouth.
Whoever is wise will observe these things, and they shall understand the goodness of Jehovah.
<b>[A Song or Psalm of David]</b> -- O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music, even with my glory.
Awake, lute and harp! I will awake at dawn.
I will give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, among the peoples, and I will make music unto You among the nations.
For Your mercy is great above the heavens, and Your truth unto the clouds.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and Your glory above all the earth,
that Your beloved may be delivered. Save with Your right hand, and answer me.
God has spoken in His holiness: I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the protection for My head; Judah is My lawgiver;
Moab is My washpot; over Edom I will cast My shoe; over Philistia I will triumph.
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
Is it not You, O God, who cast us off? And will You not, O God, go out with our armies?
Give us help from adversity, for the help of man is vain.
Through God we shall deal with might, for it is He who shall trample our enemies.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Do not keep silent, O God of my praise!
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful have opened against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought against me without a cause.
In return for my love they are my adversaries, but I am in prayer.
Thus they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set a wicked man over him, and let Satan stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, let him be found guilty, and let his prayer become sin.
Let his days be few, and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg; let them seek their bread also from the waste.
Let the creditors snare all that he has, and let strangers plunder his labor.
Let there be no one to extend mercy to him, nor any to show favor to his fatherless children.
Let his posterity be cut off, and in the following generation let their name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Let them be continually before Jehovah, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
because he did not remember to show mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, even to kill the disheartened.
As he loved cursing, so let it come upon him; as he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.
As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, so let it enter his body like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be to him like the garment which covers him, and for a girdle with which he girds himself continually.
Let this be the reward to my adversaries from Jehovah, and to those who speak evil against my soul.
But You, O Jehovah the Lord, deal with me for Your name’s sake; because Your mercy is good, rescue me.
For I am lowly and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
I am gone like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like a locust.
My knees totter from fasting, and my flesh has become lean of fatness.
I also have become a reproach to them; when they look at me, they shake their heads.
Help me, O Jehovah my God! O deliver me according to Your mercy,
that they may know that this is Your hand; that You, Jehovah, have done it!
Let them curse, but You will bless; when they arise, let them be ashamed, but let Your servant rejoice.
Let my adversaries be clothed with disgrace, and let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a cloak.
I will give abundant thanks unto Jehovah with my mouth; yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.
For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those who condemn his soul.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Jehovah said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as Your footstool.
Jehovah shall send the staff of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies.
Your people shall be volunteers in the day of Your power; in the splendor of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, You have the dew of Your youth.
Jehovah has sworn and will not regret it: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
The Lord at Your right hand shall shatter kings in the day of His wrath.
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill them with dead bodies; He shall greatly shatter the heads over the earth.
He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; therefore He shall lift up the head.
Praise YAH! I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart, in the council of the upright and in the congregation.
The works of Jehovah are great, sought out by all who have pleasure in them.
His work is honorable and glorious, and His righteousness stands eternally.
He has made His wonderful works to be remembered; Jehovah is gracious and full of compassion.
He has given food to those who fear Him; He will always be mindful of His covenant.
He has declared to His people the power of His works, to give them the heritage of the nations.
The works of His hands are faithfulness and justice; all His precepts are sure.
They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
He has sent redemption to His people; He has commanded His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those who do His commandments. His praise stands eternally.
Praise YAH! Blessed is the man who fears Jehovah, who delights greatly in His Commandments.
His seed shall be mighty on the earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
Wealth and riches will be in his house, and his righteousness stands forever.
Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
A good man deals graciously and lends; he will guide his affairs with justice.
Surely he shall never be shaken; the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah.
His heart is secure; he will not be afraid, though he sees his adversary.
He has dispersed abroad, he has given to the poor; his righteousness stands forever; his horn shall be exalted with honor.
The wicked shall see and be indignant; he shall gnash his teeth and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
Praise YAH! Praise, O servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah!
Blessed is the name of Jehovah from this time forth and forevermore!
From the rising of the sun to its going down Jehovah’s name is to be praised.
Jehovah is high above all nations, His glory above the heavens.
Who is like Jehovah our God, who dwells on high,
who humbles Himself to behold the things that are in the heavens and in the earth!
He raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the ash heap,
that He may seat him with nobles; with the nobles of His people.
He causes the barren to dwell in a house, like a joyful mother of children. Praise YAH!
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.
The sea saw it and fled; Jordan turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
What ails you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back?
O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs?
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
Not unto us, O Jehovah, not unto us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth.
Why should the nations say, Where now is their God?
But our God is in Heaven; He has done whatever He pleased.
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; eyes they have, but they do not see;
they have ears, but they do not hear; noses they have, but they do not smell;
they have hands, but they do not handle; feet they have, but they do not walk; nor do they utter through their throat.
Those who make them are like them; so is everyone who trusts in them.
O Israel, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah; He is their help and their shield.
Jehovah has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear Jehovah, both small and great.
Jehovah shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
You are blessed by Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.
Heaven, even the heavens, are Jehovah’s; but the earth He has given to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise YAH, nor any who go down into silence.
But we will bless YAH from this time forth and forevermore. Praise YAH!
I love Jehovah, because He has heard my voice and my supplications.
Because He has extended His ear to me, therefore I will call upon Him all my days.
The bands of death have encompassed me, and the distress of Sheol has fallen upon me; I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech You, deliver my soul!
Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
Jehovah protects the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, for Jehovah has dealt bountifully with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.
I had been certain, therefore I spoke; I have been greatly afflicted.
I said in my haste, All men are liars.
What shall I return unto Jehovah for all His benefits toward me?
I will take up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will make good my vows unto Jehovah now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of His saints.
O Jehovah, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of Jehovah.
I will make good my vows unto Jehovah now in the presence of all His people,
in the courts of the house of Jehovah, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise YAH!
Praise Jehovah, all you nations! Laud Him, all you peoples!
For His merciful kindness is great toward us, and the truth of Jehovah is eternal. Praise YAH!
O give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good! For His mercy is eternal.
Let Israel now say, His mercy is eternal.
Let the house of Aaron now say, His mercy is eternal.
Let those who fear Jehovah now say, His mercy is eternal.
I called upon YAH in distress; YAH answered me and set me in a broad place.
Jehovah is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
Jehovah is for me among those who help me; therefore I shall see my desire upon those who hate me.
It is better to trust in Jehovah than to put confidence in man.
It is better to trust in Jehovah than to put confidence in princes.
All the nations have surrounded me, but in the name of Jehovah I will destroy them.
They have surrounded me, yea, they have surrounded me; but in the name of Jehovah I will destroy them.
They have surrounded me like bees. They have been quenched like a fire of thorns, for in the name of Jehovah I will destroy them.
You have pushed me violently, to make me fall; but Jehovah has helped me.
YAH is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation.
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of Jehovah works with might.
The right hand of Jehovah is exalted; the right hand of Jehovah works with might.
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of YAH.
YAH has chastened and corrected me, but He has not given me over to death.
Open unto me the gates of righteousness; I will go through them, and I will praise YAH.
This is the gate of Jehovah, through which the righteous shall enter.
I will praise You, for You have answered me, and have become my salvation.
The stone which the builders have rejected has become the Head of the corner.
This is from Jehovah; it is marvelous in our eyes.
This is the day Jehovah has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Deliver now, I beseech You, O Jehovah; O Jehovah, I beseech You: Send now prosperity.
Blessed is He who comes in the name of Jehovah! We have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah.
The Mighty God is Jehovah, who shines upon us. Bind the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar.
You are my Mighty God, and I will give thanks to You; You are my God, I will exalt You.
Oh, give thanks unto Jehovah, for He is good! For His mercy is eternal.
ALEPH: Blessed are the upright in the way, who walk in the Law of Jehovah.
Blessed are those who keep His Testimonies, who seek Him with the whole heart.

My soul breaks with longing for Your Justice at all times.
You have rebuked the proud, the cursed, who go astray from Your Commandments.
Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept Your Testimonies.
Princes also have sat and spoken against me, but Your servant meditates on Your Statutes.
Your Testimonies also are my delight and my counselors.
DALETH: My soul clings to the dust; revive me according to Your Word.
I have declared my ways, and You answered me; teach me Your Statutes.
Make me understand the way of Your Precepts; so shall I meditate on Your wondrous works.

Remove from me the way of lying, and grant me Your Law graciously.
I have chosen the way of Truth; Your Justice I have laid before me.
I have clung to Your Testimonies; O Jehovah, put me not to shame!
I will run the course of Your Commandments, for You shall enlarge my heart.
HE: Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of Your Statutes, and I shall keep it to the end.
Give me understanding, and I shall keep Your Law; yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart.
Make me tread the path of Your Commandments, for I delight in it.
Extend my heart to Your Testimonies, and not to unjust gain.
Turn away my eyes from looking after vanity, and revive me in Your Way.
Establish Your Word to Your servant, who is devoted to Your fear.
Turn away my reproach which I have dreaded, for Your Justice is good.
Behold, I have longed for Your Precepts; revive me in Your righteousness.
VAU: Let Your mercies come also unto me, O Jehovah; Your salvation according to Your Word.
So shall I have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I trust in Your Word.
And do not greatly take the Word of Truth out of my mouth, for I have hoped in Your Justice.
So shall I keep Your Law continually, forever and ever.
And I will walk in a broad place, for I seek Your Precepts.
I will speak of Your Testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
And I will delight myself in Your Commandments, which I have loved.
My hands also will I lift up to Your Commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate on Your Statutes.
ZAYIN: Remember the Word to Your servant, upon which You have caused me to hope.
This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your Word has revived me.
The proud have me in great derision, yet I have not turned aside from Your Law.
I remembered Your Justice of old, O Jehovah, and have comforted myself.
Rage has taken hold upon me because of the wicked who forsake Your Law.
Your Statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
I have remembered Your name in the night, O Jehovah, and I keep Your Law.
This I have, because I have kept Your Precepts.
CHETH: You are my portion, O Jehovah; I have said that I would keep Your Words.
I have entreated Your favor with my whole heart; be merciful unto me according to Your Word.
I have considered my ways, and turned my feet unto Your Testimonies.
I made haste and did not delay to keep Your Commandments.
The company of the wicked have surrounded me, but I have not forgotten Your Law.
At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You, because of Your righteous judgments.
I am a companion of all who fear You, and of those who keep Your Precepts.
The earth, O Jehovah, is full of Your mercy; teach me Your Statutes.
TETH: You have dealt well with Your servant, O Jehovah, according to Your Word.

KAPH: My soul is spent for Your salvation; I hope in Your Word.
My eyes fail for Your Word, saying, When will You comfort me?
For I have become like a wineskin in smoke, yet I do not forget Your Statutes.
How many are the days of Your servant? When will You execute judgment upon those who persecute me?
The proud, who are not according to Your Law, have dug pits for me.
All Your Commandments are faithful; they persecute me with deception; help me!
They had almost made an end of me on earth, but I did not forsake Your Precepts.
Revive me according to Your lovingkindness, so that I may keep the Testimony of Your mouth.
LAMED: Forever, O Jehovah, Your Word stands firm in the heavens.
Your faithfulness is from generation to generation; You have established the earth, and it remains.
They have stood to this day according to Your ordinances, for they all are Your servants.

Sustain me, and I shall be safe, and I will gaze upon Your Statutes continually.
You have lightly tossed aside all those who stray from Your Statutes, for their deception is treachery.

AYIN: I have done justice and righteousness; do not abandon me to those who oppress me.
Be surety for Your servant for good; let not the arrogant ones oppress me.

Rivers of water run down from my eyes, because they do not keep Your Law.

<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- In my distress I have cried out unto Jehovah, and He heard me.
Rescue my soul, O Jehovah, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.
What shall be given to you, or what shall be done to you, O deceitful tongue?
Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of the broom tree!
Woe is me, that I have sojourned in Meshech, that I have dwelt in the tents of Kedar!
My soul has dwelt long with him who hates peace.
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- I lift up my eyes from hill to hill. From where does my help come?
My help comes from Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.
He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber.
Behold, He who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
Jehovah is your keeper; Jehovah is your shade at your right hand.
The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night.
Jehovah shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul.
Jehovah shall preserve your going out and your coming in from this time forth, and even forevermore.
<b>[A Song of Ascents of David]</b> -- I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of Jehovah.
Our feet shall stand within your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built like a city that has been joined together,
where the tribes go up, the tribes of YAH, unto the Testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.
For thrones are set there for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper who love you.
Peace be within your walls, quietness within your palaces.
For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, Peace be within you.
Because of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek your good.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens.
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon Jehovah our God, until He shall have mercy upon us.
Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah, have mercy upon us! For we are more than enough held in contempt.
Our soul has more than enough of the derision of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud who oppress us.
<b>[A Song of Ascents of David]</b> -- Unless it had been Jehovah who was for us, let Israel now say:
Unless it had been Jehovah who was for us, when men rose up against us,
then they would have swallowed us alive, when their wrath was kindled against us.
Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would have gone over our soul;
then the churning waters would have gone over our soul.
Blessed is Jehovah, who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Those who trust in Jehovah are like Mount Zion, which is not shaken, but remains forever.
As the mountains are around Jerusalem, so Jehovah is around His people from this time forth and forever.
For the scepter of the wicked shall not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, that the righteous not reach out their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O Jehovah, unto those who are good, and unto those who are upright in their hearts.
As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah shall lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- When Jehovah brought back the captivity of Zion, we were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, Jehovah has done great things for them.
Jehovah has done great things for us, and we are joyful.
Bring back our captivity, O Jehovah, as the streams in the South.
Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy.
He who goes forth with weeping, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
<b>[A Song of Ascents for Solomon]</b> -- Unless Jehovah builds the house, they labor in vain who build it; unless Jehovah guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain.
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows; for so He gives His beloved sleep.
Behold, children are a heritage from Jehovah, the fruit of the womb is a reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of one’s youth.
Blessed is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with their enemies in the gate.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah, who walks in His ways.
You shall eat the labor of your hands, you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine inside your house, your children like olive plants around your table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears Jehovah.
Jehovah bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
Yea, may you see your children’s children. Peace be upon Israel!
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Many times they have afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say:
Many times they have afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed upon my back; they made their furrows long.
Jehovah is righteous; He has cut off the cords of the wicked.
Let all those who hate Zion be put to shame and driven back.
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which is dried up before it shoots forth,
from which the reaper does not fill his hand, nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
Neither let those who pass by them say, The blessing of Jehovah be upon you; we bless you in the name of Jehovah.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Out of the depths have I cried out to You, O Jehovah;
Lord, hear my voice. Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
If You, YAH, should keep remembering iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared.
I have waited for Jehovah, my soul has waited, and in His Word I have hoped.
My soul waits for the Lord more than those who watch for the morning; yea, more than those who watch for the morning.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah; for with Jehovah there is mercy, and with Him redemption is greatly multiplied.
And He will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
<b>[A Song of Ascents of David]</b> -- Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in things beyond my understanding.
Surely my soul has been calm and quiet, like a child weaned by his mother; my soul is like a weaned child.
O Israel, hope in Jehovah from this time and forever.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- O Jehovah, remember David and all his afflictions;
how he swore to Jehovah, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
Surely I will not go into the tent of my house, nor go up into my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes nor slumber to my eyelids,
until I find a place for Jehovah, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we learned of it in the land of the forests.
Let us go into His tabernacle; let us bow down at His footstool.
Arise, O Jehovah, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints shout for joy.
For Your servant David’s sake, do not turn away the face of Your anointed.
Jehovah has sworn in truth unto David; He will not turn from it: I will set upon your throne the fruit of your body.
If your sons will keep My Covenant and My Testimony which I shall teach them, their sons also shall sit upon your throne continually.
For Jehovah has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling place.
This is My continual resting place; here I will dwell, for I have desired it.
I will bless, will bless her provisions; I will satisfy her needy with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
There will I make the horn of David sprout; I have set in place a lamp for My anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame, but his crown shall sparkle.
<b>[A Song of Ascents of David]</b> -- Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, running down to the edge of his garments.
It is like the dew of Hermon, descending upon the mountains of Zion; for there Jehovah commanded the blessing; life forevermore.
<b>[A Song of Ascents]</b> -- Behold, bless Jehovah, all you servants of Jehovah, who by night stand in the house of Jehovah.
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless Jehovah.
Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth, bless you out of Zion.
Praise YAH! Praise the name of Jehovah; praise Him, O you servants of Jehovah!
You who stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of the house of our God,
praise YAH, for Jehovah is good; make music unto His name, for it is delightful.
For YAH has chosen Jacob unto Himself, Israel for His valued treasure.
For I know that Jehovah is great, and our Lord is above all gods.
Whatever Jehovah pleases, He does in the heavens and in earth, in the seas and in all deep places.
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain; He brings the wind out of His storehouses.
He has struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
He struck many nations and slew mighty kings;
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan;
and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to Israel His people.
Your name, O Jehovah, is eternal, Your remembrance, O Jehovah, from generation to generation.
For Jehovah will judge His people, and He will have compassion on His servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; eyes they have, but they do not see;
they have ears, but they do not hear; nor is there any breath in their mouths.
Those who make them are like them; everyone who trusts in them.
Bless Jehovah, O house of Israel! Bless Jehovah, O house of Aaron!
Bless Jehovah, O house of Levi! You who fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah!
Blessed is Jehovah out of Zion, who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise YAH!
O give thanks to Jehovah, for He is good; for His mercy is eternal.
O give thanks to the God of gods; for His mercy is eternal.
O give thanks to the Lord of lords; for His mercy is eternal:
To Him who alone does great wonders, for His mercy is eternal;
to Him who by wisdom made the heavens, for His mercy is eternal;
to Him who spread out the earth above the waters, for His mercy is eternal;
to Him who made great lights, for His mercy is eternal;
the sun to rule by day, for His mercy is eternal;
the moon and stars to rule by night, for His mercy is eternal.
To Him who struck Egypt in their firstborn, for His mercy is eternal;
and brought out Israel from among them, for His mercy is eternal;
with a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, for His mercy is eternal;
to Him who divided the Red Sea in two, for His mercy is eternal;
and made Israel pass through the midst of it, for His mercy is eternal;
but overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea, for His mercy is eternal.
To Him who led His people through the wilderness, for His mercy is eternal;
to Him who struck down great kings, for His mercy is eternal;
and slew majestic kings, for His mercy is eternal;
Sihon king of the Amorites, for His mercy is eternal;
and Og king of Bashan, for His mercy is eternal;
and gave their land as a heritage, for His mercy is eternal;
a heritage to Israel His servant, for His mercy is eternal.
Who remembered us in our lowly state, for His mercy is eternal;
and rescued us from our enemies, for His mercy is eternal.
Who gives food to all flesh, for His mercy is eternal.
O give thanks to the Mighty God of Heaven; for His mercy is eternal.
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.
We hung our harps upon the willows in the midst of it.
For there those who took us captive asked of us a song, and those who plundered us requested mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion!
How shall we sing Jehovah’s song in a foreign land?
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
If I do not remember you, let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth, if I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.
Remember, O Jehovah, against the sons of Edom the day of Jerusalem, who said, Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation!
O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, blessed is the one who rewards you as you have dealt out to us.
Blessed is the one who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- I will give thanks unto You with my whole heart; before the gods I will make music unto You.
I will bow down toward Your holy temple, and give thanks unto Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; for You have magnified Your Word above all Your name.
In the day when I cried out, You answered me, and made me bold with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall give thanks unto You, O Jehovah, when they hear the Words of Your mouth.
Yea, they shall sing of the ways of Jehovah, for great is the glory of Jehovah.
Though Jehovah is on high, yet He gives attention to the lowly; but the proud He recognizes from afar.
Though I walk in the midst of distress, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will deliver me.
Jehovah will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Jehovah, is eternal; do not forsake the works of Your hands.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- O Jehovah, You have searched me and known me.
You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thoughts afar off.
You have sifted through my way of life and my lying down, and are familiar with all my ways.
For there is not a word on my tongue, but behold, O Jehovah, You know it altogether.
You have hedged me behind and before, and laid Your hand upon me.
Such knowledge is incomprehensible to me; it is high, I am not able to reach it.
Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?
If I ascend into the heavens, You are there; if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, You are there.
If I take the wings of the dawn, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
even there Your hand shall lead me, and Your right hand shall take hold of me.
If I say, Surely the darkness shall fall upon me, even the night shall be light round about me;
yea, the darkness shall not hide from You, but the night shines as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to You.
For You have possessed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb.
I will give thanks unto You, for I am awesomely and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and my soul knows it very well.
My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
Your eyes saw my embryo, and in Your book I was enrolled, and all my days had been preordained, when as yet there was nothing.
How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O Mighty God! How great is the sum of them!
If I should count them, they are more numerous than the sand; when I awake, I am still with You.
Surely You will slay the wicked, O God! Depart from me, you men of blood.
For they speak against You maliciously; Your enemies are lifted up with vanity.
Do I not hate them, O Jehovah, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?
I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies.
Search me, O Mighty God, and know my heart; try me, and know my anxieties;
and find out if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way eternal.
<b>[To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David]</b> -- Rescue me, O Jehovah, from evil men; guard me against violent men,
who have devised evil things in their hearts; they continually gather together for war.
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; the poison of vipers is under their lips. Selah
Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; guard me against violent men, who have devised to overthrow my steps.
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have laid the bait for me. Selah
I said unto Jehovah, You are my Mighty God; hear the voice of my supplications, O Jehovah.
O Lord Jehovah, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.
Do not grant, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked; do not promote his evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah
As for the head of those who surround me, let the evil of their lips cover them;
let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Let not a man who speaks evil be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
I know that Jehovah will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and justice for the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Jehovah, I cry out unto You: Make haste to me, give ear to my voice when I cry out unto You!
Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Set a guard, O Jehovah, before my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips.
Let not my heart be inclined to evil speech, to practice wicked deeds with men who do iniquity; and let me not eat of their delicacies.
Let the righteous strike me; it shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; it shall be as choicest oil; let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the evil.
Their judges have been overthrown by the hand of our Rock; they have heard my words, for they have been sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, as when one cuts and splits wood on the earth.
But my eyes are upon You, O Lord Jehovah; in You I have taken refuge; do not leave my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass on in one piece.
<b>[Maschil of David. A Prayer when he was in the cave]</b> -- I cry out unto Jehovah with my voice; with my voice unto Jehovah I make my supplication.
I pour out my meditation before Him; I make known before His face my distress.
When my spirit was faint within me, then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk they have hidden a snare for me.
Look on my right hand and see, for there is no one who acknowledges me; refuge has vanished from me; no one cares for my soul.
I cried out unto You, O Jehovah: I said, You are my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
Give attention to my cry, for I am brought very low; rescue me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I.
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Your name; the righteous shall surround me, for You shall deal bountifully with me.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness and righteousness answer me.
Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight no one living is just.
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me dwell in darkness, like those long dead.
Therefore my spirit is faint within me; my heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the works of Your hands.
I have spread my hands toward You; my soul is like a weary land. Selah
Answer me speedily, O Jehovah; my spirit wastes away! Do not hide Your face from me, lest I be like those who go down into the pit.
Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, for in You do I trust; cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto You.
Rescue me, O Jehovah, from my enemies; in You I have taken cover.
Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me into the land of uprightness.
Revive me, O Jehovah, for Your name’s sake! For Your righteousness’sake bring my soul out of distress.
In Your mercy cut off my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul; for I am Your servant.
<b>[A Psalm of David]</b> -- Blessed is Jehovah my Rock, who teaches my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;
my goodness and my stronghold, my refuge and my deliverer, my shield and the One in whom I trust, who subdues my people under me.
Jehovah, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?
Man is like a breath; his days are like a shadow that vanishes.
Bow down Your heavens, O Jehovah, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.
Extend Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of the sons of foreigners,
whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of deception.
I will sing a new song unto You, O God; upon a lute and an instrument of ten strings I will make music unto You,
the One who gives deliverance to kings; who rescues David His servant from the evil sword.
Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of the sons of foreigners, whose mouth speaks vanity, and whose right hand is a right hand of deception;
that our sons may be as plants brought up in their youth; that our daughters may be like corner stones, carved in the form of a palace;
that our granaries may be full, furnishing kind to kind; and our flocks may bring forth thousands and ten thousands outside;
that our oxen may be laden; that there be no breaking in or going out; that there be no outcry in our streets.
Blessed are the people who are like this; blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah!
<b>[A Praise of David]</b> -- I will extol You, my God, O King; and I will bless Your name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.
Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised; and His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation shall praise Your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts.
I will meditate on the glorious splendor of Your majesty, and on Your wondrous works.
Men shall speak of the might of Your awesome acts, and I will declare Your greatness.
They shall pour forth the memory of Your great goodness, and shall shout of Your righteousness.
Jehovah is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger and great in kindness.
Jehovah is good to all, and His compassions are over all His works.
All Your works shall give thanks to You, O Jehovah, and Your saints shall bless You.
They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your power,
to make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of His kingdom.
Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and Your dominion is from generation to generation.
Jehovah upholds all who fall, and raises up all who are bowed down.
The eyes of all wait upon You, and You give them their food in due season.
You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
Jehovah is righteous in all His ways, and kind in all His works.
Jehovah is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth.
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him; He also will hear their cry and save them.
Jehovah preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of Jehovah, and all flesh shall bless His holy name forever and ever.
Praise YAH! Praise Jehovah, O my soul!
While I live I will praise Jehovah; I will make music unto my God while I have my being.
Do not put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help.
His spirit departs, he returns to the earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Blessed is he who has the Mighty God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God,
who made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps truth forever,
who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. Jehovah lets loose the prisoners.
Jehovah opens the eyes of the blind; Jehovah raises those who are bowed down; Jehovah loves the righteous.
Jehovah watches over the sojourners; He relieves the fatherless and widow; but the way of the wicked He turns upside down.
Jehovah shall reign forever; Your God, O Zion, from generation to generation. Praise YAH!
Praise YAH! For it is good to make music unto our God, for it is pleasant, and praise is beautiful.
Jehovah builds up Jerusalem; He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name.
Great is our Lord, and of great power; His understanding is infinite.
Jehovah lifts up the lowly; He casts the wicked down to the ground.
Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; make music with the harp to our God,
who covers the heavens with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the mountains.
He gives to the beast its food, and to the young ravens that cry out.
He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
Jehovah takes pleasure in those who fear Him, in those who hope in His mercy.
Praise Jehovah, O Jerusalem! Boast in your God, O Zion!
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you.
He makes peace in your borders, and fills you with the finest wheat.
He sends forth His command upon the earth; His Word runs very swiftly.
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;
He casts out His hail like morsels; who can stand before His cold?
He sends out His Word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.
He declares His Word unto Jacob, His Statutes and His justice unto Israel.
He has not dealt thus with any other nation; and they have not known His justice. Praise YAH!
Praise YAH! Praise Jehovah from the heavens; praise Him in the heights!
Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His hosts!
Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all you stars of light!
Praise Him, you heavens of heavens, and you waters above the heavens!
Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for He commanded and they were created.
He also established them forever and ever; He made a decree which shall not pass away.
Praise Jehovah from the earth, you dragons and all the depths;
fire and hail, snow and vapor; stormy wind fulfilling His Word;
mountains and all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars;
beasts and all cattle; creeping things and birds on the wing;
kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth;
both young men and maidens; old men and children:
Let them praise the name of Jehovah, for His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
He has also exalted the horn of His people, the praise of all His saints, of the children of Israel, a people near unto Him. Praise YAH!
Praise YAH! Sing unto Jehovah a new song, and His praise in the assembly of saints.
Let Israel rejoice in Him who made them; let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise His name in the dance; let them make music unto Him with the timbrel and harp.
For Jehovah takes pleasure in His people; He will glorify the lowly with salvation.
Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them shout aloud upon their beds.
Let the exaltation of the Mighty God be in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand,
to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishment upon the peoples;
to bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with bonds of iron;
to execute upon them the judgment that is written; this honor is for all His saints. Praise YAH!
Praise YAH! Praise the Mighty God in His sanctuary; praise Him in His mighty firmament!
Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His excellent greatness!
Praise Him with the sound of the shofar; praise Him with the lute and harp!
Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and pipes!
Praise Him with sounding cymbals; praise Him with loud cymbals!
Let everything that has breath praise YAH. Praise YAH!
The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
to receive instruction in wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man.
The wise hears and increases learning, and the one of understanding gets wise counsel,
to understand a proverb and an enigma; the words of the wise, and their difficult sayings.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
My son, hear the instruction of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother;
for they shall be an ornament of grace to your head, and chains around your neck.
My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
If they say, Walk with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause,
let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those who go down into the Pit,
we shall find all sorts of precious stuff, we shall fill our houses with plunder;
cast in your lot among us, let us all have one purse.
My son, do not walk in the way with them! Withhold your foot from their path;
for their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed blood.
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
And they lie in wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own souls.
So are the ways of everyone who gets unjust gain; it takes away the soul of its master.
Wisdom cries aloud outside; she utters her voice in the square;
she calls out over the tumult; at the openings of the gates, in the city she utters her words:
How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity; and those who scorn desire their scorning; and fools hate knowledge?
Turn back at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you; I will make my words known to you.
Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one pays attention,
but you have ignored all my counsel, and have not desired my reproof:
I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your terror comes;
when your terror comes like a storm; and your devastation arrives like a tempest, when distress and anguish come upon you.
Then they shall call upon me, and I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.
Because they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of Jehovah.
They did not desire my counsel; they despised all my reproof.
Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple kills them, and the ease of fools destroys them.
But whoever listens to me shall live in confidence, and shall rest securely from the dread of evil.
My son, if you will receive my words, and treasure up my commandments within you,
so that you incline your ear to wisdom, and extend your heart to understanding;
yes, if you cry out for discernment, lifting up your voice for understanding;
if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures,
then you shall understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.
For Jehovah gives wisdom; out of His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
He lays up sound wisdom for the upright; a shield to those who walk in integrity,
to guard the paths of judgment; and He keeps watch over the way of His saints.
Then you shall understand righteousness and justice and equity and every good path.
When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul,
discretion shall keep watch over you, understanding shall guard you,
to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perverse things,
those who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perversities of the wicked,
whose paths are crooked, who are devious in their tracks;
to deliver you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words,
who forsakes the guide of her youth and has forgotten the covenant of her God.
For her house leads down to death, and her tracks to the spirits of the dead.
No one going in to her returns, nor do they attain unto the ways of life.
That you may walk in the ways of the good and keep the ways of the righteous.
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and those who act deceitfully shall be rooted out of it.
My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart keep my commandments,
for they shall add length of days and long life and peace to you.
Let not mercy and truth forsake you; tie them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart;
so you shall find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and lean not unto your own understanding.
In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.
Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear Jehovah and depart from evil.
It shall be healing to your navel and refreshment to your bones.
Honor Jehovah with your substance, and with the firstfruits of all your increase,
and your barns shall be filled with plenty, and your vats shall be bursting with new wine.
My son, do not reject the chastening of Jehovah, and do not loathe His correction;
for whom Jehovah loves He corrects, even as a father corrects the son with whom he is pleased.
Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gets understanding;
for its profit is better than the gain from silver, and its increase more than fine gold.
She is more precious than rubies, and all the things you can desire are not to be compared with her.
Length of days is in her right hand, riches and honor in her left hand.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to those who lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone who holds fast to her.
Jehovah has founded the earth by wisdom; He has established the heavens by understanding;
the depths were broken up by His knowledge, and the clouds drop down the dew.
My son, do not let them depart from your eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,
and they shall be life to your soul, and grace to your neck;
then you shall walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.
When you lie down, you shall not be in dread; yea, you shall lie down and your sleep shall be sweet.
Do not be afraid of sudden terror, nor of the devastation of the wicked when it comes.
For Jehovah shall be at your side, and He shall keep your foot from being caught.
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.
Do not say to your neighbor, Go and come back again, and tomorrow I will give, when you have it with you.
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells by you securely.
Do not strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
Do not be envious of the violent man, and choose none of his ways;
for the perverse one is an abomination to Jehovah, but His secret counsel is with the upright.
The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the abode of the just.
Surely He scorns the scorners, but He gives grace to the lowly.
The wise inherit honor, but the exaltation of fools is shame.
Children, hear the instruction of a father, and pay attention to know understanding,
for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my law.
For I was my father’s son, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.
And he taught me and said to me, Let your heart cling to my words; keep my commandments and live.
Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will keep you.
The first thing about wisdom is: Get wisdom. And with all your getting, get understanding.
Exalt her, and she will lift you up; she shall bring you to honor when you embrace her.
She shall bestow a wreath of grace upon your head; she shall give you a crown of glory.
Oh my son, hear and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many.
I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in straight tracks;
when you go, your steps shall not be constricted, and when you run, you shall not stumble.
Take fast hold of instruction, do not let her go; keep her, for she is your life.
Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not go in the way of evil.
Avoid it, do not pass by it; turn from it and pass on.
For they do not sleep unless they have done evil, and their sleep is taken away unless they cause someone to fall.
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
But the path of the just is as the brightness of dawn, that keeps getting brighter until it is fully daytime.
The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know at what they stumble.
My son, pay attention to my sayings; extend your ear to my words;
let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the center of your heart;
for they are life to those who find them, and health to all their flesh.
Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.
Turn away from you the crooked mouth, and put perverse lips far from you.
Let your eyes look straight ahead, and let your eyelids look straight before you.
Ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be established.
Do not turn to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil.
My son, pay attention to my wisdom; extend your ear to my understanding;
so that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.
For the lips of a strange woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil,
but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a cleaver;
her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol;
lest you should ponder the path of life, her paths are unstable; you cannot know them.
Therefore hear me now, O children, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
Remove your ways far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,
lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel;
that strangers not be filled with your strength, nor your labors be in the house of a foreigner,
and you moan in the end, when your flesh and body are spent;
and say, How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised correction;
and I have not given heed to the voice of my teachers, nor extended my ear to those instructing me.
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.
Should your springs be dispersed abroad, like streams of water in the streets?
Let them be only your own, and not for strangers with you.
Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,
as a loving deer and a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and always be intoxicated in her love.
For why, my son, will you be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and He ponders all his tracks.
His own iniquities shall capture the wicked, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin.
He shall die without instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
My son, if you are surety for your friend, if you have struck your hands with a stranger,
you are snared with the words of your mouth; you are captured with the words of your mouth.
My son, do this then, and deliver yourself when you come into the hand of your friend: go humble yourself and entreat your friend.
Do not give sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise;
who, having no commander, overseer or ruler,
provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.
How long will you rest, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;
so shall your poverty come as one walking, and your need like an armed man.
A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,
winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, pointing with his fingers.
Perversity is in his heart, he devises evil all the time, he spreads strife.
Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; he shall be broken in an instant without remedy.
These six things Jehovah hates; yea, seven are an abomination to his soul:
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
a heart that devises evil plans, feet hurrying to run to evil,
a false witness who breathes lies, and he who spreads strife among brothers.
My son, keep your father’s commands, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
Bind them perpetually to your heart; tie them around your neck.
When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.
For the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
to keep you from the evil woman, from the seductiveness of the foreign tongue.
Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, and do not let her captivate you with her eyelids.
For on account of a promiscuous woman, a man comes to a loaf of bread; for the man’s wife hunts for the precious soul.
Can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned?
Or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?
So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.
They do not despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.
But if he is found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the wealth of his house.
He who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart; he who does so destroys his own soul.
Wounds and dishonor shall befall him, and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not regard any bribes, nor will he yield to the giving of many gifts.
My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments within you.
Keep my commandments and live, and my law as the pupil of your eye.
Tie them upon your fingers; write them upon the tablet of your heart.
Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call understanding your kinsman,
that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who makes smooth her words.
For I looked through my lattice, at the window of my house,
and I saw among the simple ones, I observed among the children a young man lacking heart,
passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the darkness of night.
And behold, a woman came to meet him, with the attire of a harlot, and a heart of secrecy.
(She is boisterous and stubborn; her feet do not settle down in her own house.
At one moment she is outside, the next in the streets, and she lies in wait at every corner.)
So she has seized him and kissed him; and with straight face says to him,
Regarding my peace offerings, today I have completed my vows;
therefore I came out to meet you, earnestly to seek your face, and I have found you.
I have spread my bed with coverings, with striped cloths of linen from Egypt.
I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us delight ourselves with lovemaking.
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
He has taken in hand a bag of money, and will come home on the day of the full moon.
With great persuasion she influences him; with her seductive lips she moves him.
In an instant he goes after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool goes to correction in fetters;
till an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hastens to the snare; and does not realize that it is for his soul.
Now then, listen to me, O sons, and pay attention to the words of my mouth:
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.
For many are the wounded she has caused to fall, and countless are the ones slain by her.
Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.
Does not wisdom call out? And does not understanding put forth her voice?
She stands at the top of high places, by the wayside, where the paths meet,
beside the gates; at the opening to the city, at the doors of entry, she cries aloud:
I call out to you, O men, and my voice is to the sons of men.
Understand wisdom, you simple ones; and you fools, be of an understanding heart.
Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, and from the opening of my lips shall be right things.
For my mouth shall utter truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; nothing crooked or perverse is in them;
they are all plain to the one who understands; and right to those who find knowledge.
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge, rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than jewels, and all delightful things cannot be compared to it.
I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find out the knowledge of devices.
The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding; I have strength.
By me kings reign, and judges decree justice.
Rulers and nobles rule by me; even all the judges of the earth.
I love those who love me, and those who seek me early find me.
Riches and honor are with me; enduring wealth and righteousness.
My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;
to cause those who love me to inherit substance, and I will fill up their treasuries.
Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of His way; His works from antiquity.
I was anointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;
before He had made the earth and the fields, or the highest part of the dust of the world.
When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle upon the face of the deep,
when He made firm the clouds above, when He made strong the fountains of the deep,
when He gave to the sea its limit, that the waters should not pass beyond His command; when He engraved the foundations of the earth,
then I was at His side, like a master workman; and I was His delight day by day, being in merriment before Him at all times;
making merry in the world, His earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.
Now therefore listen to me, O children, for blessed are those who keep my ways.
Hear instruction, and be wise, and do not refuse it.
Blessed is the man who gives heed to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
For whoever finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor from Jehovah.
But he who sins against me does violence to his own soul; all who hate me love death.
Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars;
she has slaughtered her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
She has sent out her maidens; she calls out from the highest places of the city:
Whoever is simple, turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mixed.
Forsake simplicity, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
He who reproves a scorner gets shame to himself; and he who rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blemish.
Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
Give to a wise one, and he will become wiser; teach a just one, and he will increase in learning.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.
If you are wise, you shall be wise for yourself, and if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.
A foolish woman is boisterous; she is naive, and knows nothing.
And she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
to call out to those who pass by, who are going straight on their ways:
Whoever is simple, let him turn in here; and to the one lacking heart, she says to him:
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there; the ones she summons are in the depths of Sheol.
The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father rejoice, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness delivers from death.
Jehovah will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry, but He thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
He who works with a slack hand becomes poor, but the hand of the diligent makes rich.
He who gathers in summer is a prudent son; he who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.
Blessings are upon the head of the just, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.
The wise in heart accepts commands, but the foolish of lips shall be thrown down.
He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways shall be found out.
He who winks with the eye causes sorrow, but the foolish of lips shall be thrown down.
The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.
Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all transgressions.
Wisdom is found in the lips of him who has discernment, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks heart.
The wise treasure up knowledge, but the mouth of the fool is near destruction.
The rich man’s wealth is his strong city; the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
The labor of the righteous is life; the gain of the wicked is sin.
He who heeds instruction is in the way of life, but he who forsakes reproof wanders.
He who hides hatred with lying lips, and he who sends out a slander, is a fool.
In the abundance of words there is no end of transgression, but he who restrains his lips is prudent.
The tongue of the just is as choice silver; the heart of the wicked is as little.
The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of heart.
The blessing of Jehovah, it makes rich, with no sorrow added.
It is as jest to a fool to do wickedness; so is wisdom to a man of understanding.
That which the wicked fears shall come upon him, but the desire of the righteous is granted.
As the storm passes, so the wicked is no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him.
The fear of Jehovah prolongs days, but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
The hope of the righteous is gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
The way of Jehovah is a refuge to the upright, but destruction to doers of iniquity.
The righteous shall never be moved, but the wicked shall not dwell on the earth.
The mouth of the just bears fruit with wisdom, but the perverse tongue shall be cut off.
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, perversities.
A deceitful scale is an abomination to Jehovah, but a perfect weight stone is His delight.

The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them, but traitors shall be taken in their lust.
In the death of a wicked man, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of the wicked shall perish.
The righteous is delivered from distress, and the wicked goes in instead of him.
The hypocrite destroys his neighbor with his mouth, but the just is delivered through knowledge.
When the righteous prosper, the city rejoices; and when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.
A city is exalted by the blessing of the upright, but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown.
One who despises his neighbor is without heart, but a man of understanding keeps quiet.
One who goes around with slander reveals secrets, but the faithful spirit keeps the matter covered.
In the absence of counsel the people fall, but there is safety in the abundance of counselors.

A gracious woman holds on to honor, and ruthless men hold on to riches.

As righteousness leads to life, so the one pursuing evil does so to his own death.
Those who are of a perverse heart are an abomination to Jehovah, but the perfect in their way are His delight.
Though hand join to hand, the wicked shall not be held innocent, but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a beautiful woman who has turned aside from discretion.
The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.

The sluggard says, There is a lion in the way! A lion is in the streets!

The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the burden. The man spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
Surely I am more stupid than any man, and do not have the understanding of a man.
I have not learned wisdom, nor the knowledge of the Holy One.
Who has gone up into Heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son’s name? Surely you know.
Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.
Do not add to His Words, that He not judge you and you be found a liar.
Two things I have asked of You (Do not withhold them before I die):
Remove far from me vanity and lying words; give me neither poverty or riches, provide for me my prescribed portion of food;
lest I be full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
Do not accuse a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.

The eye that mocks his father and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.

The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, and the way of a man with a virgin.
This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.
Under three things the earth quakes, and under four it is not able to bear up:
For a servant when he reigns, a fool when he is filled with food,
a hateful woman when she is married, and a maidservant that is heir to her mistress.
Four things are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise:
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
the hyrax are not a mighty people, yet they make their dwellings in the crags;
the locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth in swarms;
you can catch a lizard with the hands, yet it is in king’s palaces.
There are three things that are beautiful in their stride, yea, four that go right along:
The lion is mighty among beasts and does not turn back from the face of anything;
one girded in the loins; and a he goat; and a king with his army.
If you have done foolishly in exalting yourself, or if you have devised evil, lay your hand over your mouth.
Surely the churning of milk yields butter, and the squeezing of the nose brings forth blood; so the wringing of wrath brings forth strife.
The words of King Lemuel, the burden which his mother taught him:
What, my son? And what, the son of my womb? And what, the son of my vows?
Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink;
lest they drink, and forget the Law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
Give strong drink to him who is about to die, and wine to one who is of a heavy soul.
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
Open your mouth for the mute, for the judgment of all those sentenced to destruction.
Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the case of the poor and needy.
Who can find a woman of strength? For her value is far above rubies.
The heart of her husband trusts safely in her, so that he shall have no lack of gain.
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeks wool and flax, and works willingly with her hands.
She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from afar.
She also rises while it is still night, and prepares food for her household, and portions for her maidservants.
She considers a field and buys it; from the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
She girds her loins with strength, and makes her arms strong.
She tastes that her merchandise is good; her lamp does not go out by night.
She reaches her hands to the distaff, and her hand holds the spindle.
She extends her hand to the poor; yea, she reaches out her hands to the needy.
She is not afraid of the snow for her household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
She makes tapestry for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.

Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness.
She watches over the ways of her household, and does not eat the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
Many daughters have dealt with strength, but you have excelled them all.
Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears Jehovah, she shall be praised.
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
The words of the preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.
What is the profit to a man in all his labor which he labors under the sun?
A generation passes away, and a generation comes; but the earth stands perpetually.
The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, panting in a hurry to its place where it rises again.
The wind goes toward the south, and it turns around to the north; it whirls around continually; and the wind returns according to its circuits.
All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from where the rivers come, there they return again.
All things are full of labor; man is not able to utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.
Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has already been in the days of antiquity, which were before us.
There is no remembrance of former things, and also no remembrance of following things of what will be; nor a remembrance of those things by those who follow afterwards.
I, the preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I have given my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that which is done under the heavens. It is an evil task which God has given to the sons of men to be busied with.
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and striving of spirit.
What is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.
I spoke within my own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have gathered more wisdom than all who have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart has seen much of wisdom and knowledge.
And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I have perceived that this also is striving of spirit.
For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
I said in my heart, Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore regard pleasure; and this was vanity.
I said of laughter, It is madness; and of mirth, What does it accomplish?
I sought in my heart to gratify my flesh with wine, while leading my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might find out what was good for the sons of men to do under the heavens all the days of their life.
I made my works great; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.
I made gardens and orchards for myself, and I planted trees in them, of all kinds of fruit.
I made pools of water for myself, to water the forest springing up with trees.
I have bought slaves and maids, and had servants born in my house; I also had more livestock, herds and flocks, than all were before me in Jerusalem.
I also gathered silver and gold to myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, wives and concubines.
I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.
And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my share from all my labor.
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and striving of spirit; and there was no profit under the sun.
And I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the king, when it has already been done?
Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness; and I also considered that one event happens to them all.
Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever, since that which is now shall all be forgotten in the days to come. And how does the wise man die? Same as the fool!
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun is evil to me; for all is vanity and striving of spirit.
Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; because I must leave it to the man who shall come after me.
And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This also is vanity.
Therefore I turned my heart to despair over all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet he shall leave it as inheritance to a man who has not labored in it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
For what has man from all his labor, and from the striving of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?
For all his days are sorrows, and his task grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This also is vanity.
Is it not good for a man to eat and drink and make his soul behold the good in his labor. This also, I saw, that it was from the hand of God.
For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from Me?
For God gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who is good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to collect and gather, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.
To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens:
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to root up what is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to throw away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to throw away;
a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
What profit does he have who works in that in which he labors?
I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of men to keep busy.
He has made everything beautiful in its time; also He has set eternity in their hearts, so that no man can find out the work that God has made from the beginning to the end.
I know that there is no good for man, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor; it is the gift of God.
I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God does it so that men should fear before Him.
That which has been, is now; and that which is to be, already has been; and God exacts what is pursued.
Moreover I saw under the sun in the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
I said in my heart concerning the manner of the sons of men, that God tests them, that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
For that which happens to the sons of men also happens to beasts, even one thing happens to them. As this one dies, so that one dies; yea, they all have one breath; so that a man has no advantage over a beast; for all is vanity.
All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust again.
Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?
Therefore I have seen that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who can bring him to see what shall be after him?
So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold the tears of the oppressed ones, and they had no comforter! And on the side of those who oppressed them there was power, but they had no comforter.
Therefore I congratulated the dead who already have died, more than the living who are still alive.
Yea, better than both is he who has never existed, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Again, I considered all labor, and every successful work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and striving of spirit.
The fool folds his hands together, and devours his own flesh.
Better is a hand filled with rest than two hands full with travail and striving of spirit.
Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
There is one alone, without a second; indeed, he has neither son nor brother; yet there is no end to all his labor; and his eyes are not satisfied with riches; and he does not ask, For whom do I labor and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity; indeed, it is an evil task.
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.
For if they fall, the one will lift up his companion; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up.
Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?
And if one overpowers him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
A poor and wise youth is better than an old and foolish king, who will not be admonished any more.
For he comes out of prison to reign; although in his kingdom he was poor.
I saw all the living who walk under the sun, with the second youth who stands in his place.
There is no end of all the people, of all who have been before them; they also who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and striving of spirit.
Guard your feet when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools. For they do not know that they are doing evil.
Do not be rash with your mouth, and do not let your heart be hasty to say a word before God. For God is in Heaven, and you are on earth; therefore let your words be few.
For a dream comes through much activity; and a fool’s voice by the multitude of words.
When you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it; for He has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you have vowed.
It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.
Do not permit your mouth to cause your flesh to sin; do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
For in the multitude of dreams and increasing of words there is also vanity; but fear God.
If you see the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, do not be astonished at the matter; for He who is higher than the highest watches; so there are those higher than they.
And the advantage of the land is for all; even a king has fields being tilled.
He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with gain. This also is vanity.
When the goods increase, those who eat it increase; what profit is it, then, to its owners, except to see it with their eyes?
The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun: riches kept for their owners to their hurt.
But those riches perish by evil use. And he begets a son, and there is nothing in his hand.
As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked he shall return, to go as he came. And from his labor he shall take away nothing that he may carry in his hand.
And this also is a sore evil, that in all, as he came, so shall he go; and what profit does he have who has labored for the wind?
All his days he eats in darkness, and he has much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
Behold that which I have seen: It is good and right for one to eat and to drink, and to see good in all his labor that he labors under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it is his portion.
Also every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.
For he does not excessively dwell on the days of his life, because God keeps him busy in the joy of his heart.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is widespread among men:
A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner devours it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
If a man begets a hundred, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, and his soul is not filled with goodness, and there is also for him no burial; I say, a miscarriage is better than he;
for it comes in with vanity and goes out in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.
Also it has not seen the sun, nor known anything. This one has more rest than the other.
Yea, though he lives twice a thousand years, yet he has seen no goodness. Do not all go to one place?
All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the soul is not satisfied.
For what has the wise more than the fool? What does the poor have, who knows how to walk before the living?
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This is also vanity and striving of spirit.
That which one is, he has been named already, and it is known that he is man. And he is not able to contend with Him who is mightier than he.
Since there are many things that increase vanity, how is man any better?
For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
A good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will take it to heart.
Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made better.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools.
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity.
Surely oppression makes a fool out of a wise man; and a bribe destroys the heart.
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it; the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
Do not be hasty in your spirit to be angry; for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
Do not say, Why were the former days better than these? For you do not ask wisely concerning this.
Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and profitable to those who see the sun.
For wisdom is a defense, and money is a defense; but the excellence of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those who have it.
Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what He has made crooked?
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity take note that God also has ordained the one next to the other, in order that man should not find anything after him.
I have seen everything in the days of my vanity: There is a just one who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked one who prolongs life in his wickedness.
Do not be overly righteous, nor be overly wise; why should you destroy yourself?
Do not be overly wicked, and do not be a fool; why should you die before your time?
It is good that you should grasp this; yea, also from this do not withdraw your hand; for he who fears God shall come forth out from them all.
Wisdom makes the wise stronger than ten who dominate the city.
For there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin.
Also do not take to heart all words that are spoken; lest you hear your servant curse you.
For your own heart knows that you yourself have also cursed others many times.
All this I have proved by wisdom; I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, who can find it out?
I set my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness;
and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands like fetters. Whoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be captured by her.
Behold, this I have found, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the reckoning,
which my soul still seeks, but I find not. One man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all those I have not found.
Lo, this only I have found, that God has made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.
Who is as the wise? And who knows the explanation of a thing? A man’s wisdom makes his face shine, and the strength of his face is changed.
I say, Keep the king’s edict, because of the oath of God.
Do not be hasty to leave his presence. Do not take a stand in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him;
because in the word of a king is power; and who may say to him, What are you doing?
Whoever keeps the command shall experience no evil decree; and a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment.
Because for every desire there is a time and judgment, for the evil of man increases greatly.
For he does not know what shall be; so who can tell him when it shall be?
No one has power over the spirit to restrain the spirit; nor power in the day of death; and there is no discharge from that war; nor shall wickedness deliver its owners.
All this I have seen, and I gave my heart to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.
And so I saw the wicked buried, they who had come and gone from the consecrated place. And they were forgotten in the city where they had done so. This also is vanity.
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him.
But it shall not be well with the wicked, nor shall he prolong his days, which are like a shadow; because he does not fear before God.
There is a vanity which is done on the earth: There are just ones to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked ones to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
Then I praised gladness, because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be glad; for that shall remain with him of his labor for the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.
When I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth, not seeing sleep with the eyes, day or night;
then I looked at all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Moreover, though a wise one speaks of knowing, yet he shall not be able to find it.
For all this I took to heart, in order to explain it: that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God. No man knows, whether by love or hatred, all that is before them.
All happens alike to everyone; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice. As is the good, so is the sinner. He who swears is as he who fears an oath.
This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event to all. Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
For whoever is chosen, of all those living, there is confidence; for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
For the living know that they shall die; but the dead do not know anything, nor do they have any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, have now perished; nor do they ever any longer have a part in anything that is done under the sun.
Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.
Let your garments always be white; and let your head lack no ointment.
Look on life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life, which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity. For that is your share in this life, and in your labor which you labor under the sun.
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no work nor reasoning nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol where you go.
I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happens to them all.
For man also does not know his time; as the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.
This wisdom I have seen also under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it and besieged it, and built huge bulwarks against it.
And a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no one remembered that poor man.
And I said, Wisdom is better than strength; but the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
The words of the wise are heard in quiet, more than the shouts of him who rules among fools.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.
As dead flies cause the perfumer’s ointment to stink and ferment; so does a little folly to one esteemed for wisdom and honor.
A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
Even when a fool walks along the way, his heart fails; and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, remain quietly where you are; for quietness heals great offenses.
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes from a ruler’s presence:
Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking on the ground like servants.
He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a hedge may be bitten by a snake.
Whoever removes stones may be hurt by them; and he who splits wood may be endangered by it.
If the iron is blunt, and he does not whet the edge, then he must exert more strength. But wisdom gives excellent success.
The snake may bite if it is not charmed; and a master of the tongue is no better.
The words of a wise mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow him up.
The words of his mouth begin with foolishness; and the end of his talk is wicked madness.
A fool also multiplies words; a man does not know what shall be; and who can tell him what shall be after him?
The labor of fools wearies him, because he does not even know how to go to the city.
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your rulers eat in the morning.
Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your rulers eat at the proper time, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Because of laziness the building decays; and through idleness of hands the house leaks.
Food is made for laughter, and wine makes merry; but money is the answer to everything.
Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts; and do not curse the rich, not even in your bedroom; for a bird of the air may carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.
Cast your bread upon the waters; for you shall find it after many days.
Give a share to seven, and also to eight; for you do not know what evil shall be on the earth.
If the clouds are full of rain, they empty upon the earth; and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.
He who watches the wind will not sow; and he who pays attention to the clouds will not reap.
As you do not know what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of a pregnant woman; even so you do not know the works of God who makes everything.
In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which shall be blessed, either this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good.
Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.
But if a man lives many years, and rejoices in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. All that has come is vanity.
Rejoice in your youth, young man; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment.
Therefore remove vexation from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh; for childhood and black hair of youth are vanity.
Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, so that the evil days do not come, nor the years draw near, when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them.
While the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain;
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men bow down, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out of the windows are darkened,
and the doors are shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are silenced;
also they are afraid of the heights, and terrors along the way, and the almond tree blossoms, and the grasshopper is a burden, and desire fails; because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets;
or before the silver cord is loosed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern;
then the dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.
Vanity of vanities, says the preacher; all is vanity.
And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.
The preacher sought to learn acceptable words; written words of uprightness and truth.
The words of the wise are like goads, and as nails from the collection, fastened by the Master, given from one Shepherd.
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: The making of many books has no end, and much study is a weariness to the flesh.
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is for every man.
For God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.
The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
Shulamite: Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love is better than wine.
Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, your name is ointment poured forth; therefore the virgins love you.
Draw me away! Daughters of Jerusalem: We will run after you. Shulamite: The king has brought me into his chambers. Daughters of Jerusalem: We will be glad and rejoice in you. We will remember your love more than wine. Shulamite: Rightly do they love you.
I am black, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
Do not look upon me, because I am black, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept.
To Her Beloved: Tell me, O you whom I love, where you feed your flock, where you make it rest at noon. For why should I be as one who veils herself by the flocks of your companions?
The Beloved: If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the footsteps of the flock, and feed your young goats beside the tents of the shepherds.
I have compared you, my love, to my filly among Pharaoh’s chariots.
Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with chains of gold.
Daughters of Jerusalem: We will make you ornaments of gold with studs of silver.
Shulamite: While the king is at his table, my spikenard sends forth its fragrance.
A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, who lies between my breasts.
My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blooms in the vineyards of En Gedi.
The Beloved: Behold, you are beautiful, my love! Behold, you are beautiful; with dove’s eyes!
Shulamite: Behold, you are handsome, my beloved! Yes, pleasant! Also our bed is green.
The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
The Beloved: Like a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
Shulamite: Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down in his shade with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
To the Daughters of Jerusalem: He brought me into the house of wine, and his banner over me was love.
Sustain me with cakes of raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am lovesick.
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.
Shulamite: The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he stands behind our wall; he is looking through the windows, gazing through the lattice.
My beloved spoke, and said to me: Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
The fig tree ripens her green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away!
O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the cliff, let me see your form, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your appearance is beautiful.
Her Brothers: Catch us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines, for our vines have tender grapes.
Shulamite: My beloved is mine, and I am his. He grazes among the lilies.
To Her Beloved: Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag upon the mountains of Bether.
Shulamite: By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him.
I will rise now, and go about the city; in the streets and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I did not find him.
The watchmen who go about the city found me and I said, Have you seen him whom my soul loves?
Scarcely had I passed by them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I took hold of him and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the room of her who conceived me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.
Shulamite: Who is this coming out of the wilderness like columns of smoke, like the smoke of sacrifices of myrrh and frankincense, of all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
Behold, it is Solomon’s bed, with sixty mighty men around it, of the mighty of Israel.
They all hold swords, being expert in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh because of fear in the night.
King Solomon made himself a palanquin from trees of Lebanon.
He made its pillars of silver, its support of gold, its seat of purple; its interior paved with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and see King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day, the day of the gladness of his heart.
The Beloved: Behold, you are beautiful, my love! Behold, you are beautiful! You have dove’s eyes behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats lying down at Mount Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep which have come up from the washing, every one of which bears twins, and none is barren among them.
Your lips are like a strand of scarlet, and your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like a piece of pomegranate.
Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, which feed among the lilies.
Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no defect in you.
Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one look of your eyes, with the pendant around your neck.
How beautiful is your love, My sister, my spouse! How much better than wine is your love, and the scent of your ointments than all spices!
Your lips, O my spouse, drip as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
A bolted enclosed garden is my sister, my spouse; a spring locked up, a fountain sealed.
Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with excellent fruits, fragrant henna with spikenard,
spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief balsam;
a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
Shulamite: Awake, O north wind, and come, O south! Blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come to his garden and eat its excellent fruits.
The Beloved: I have come to my garden, my sister, my spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. To His Friends: Eat, O friends! Drink, yes, get drunk, O beloved ones!
Shulamite: I sleep, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my beloved! He knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one; for my head is covered with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.
I have stripped off my gown; how shall I put it on again? I have washed my feet; how shall I dirty them?
My beloved put his hand by the latch of the door, and my heart yearned for him.
I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned away and was gone. My soul went forth when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took my veil away from me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: If you find my beloved, that you tell him I am lovesick!
Daughters of Jerusalem: What is your beloved more than any other beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than any other beloved, that you charge us so?
Shulamite: My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, standing out among ten thousand.
His head is like the finest gold; his locks are wavy, and black as a raven.
His eyes are like doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and set in a frame.
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, like grown herbs. His lips are like lilies, dripping flowing myrrh.
His hands are like folds of gold filled with precious stones. His torso is smooth as ivory overlaid with sapphires.
His legs are like pillars of marble set on bases of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
His mouth is most sweet. Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
Daughters of Jerusalem: Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned aside, that we may seek him with you?
Shulamite: My beloved has gone to his garden, to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. He grazes among the lilies.
The Beloved: O my love, you are as beautiful as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners!
Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats lying down in Gilead.
Your teeth are like a flock of ewes which have come up from the washing; every one bears twins, and not one is barren among them.
Like a piece of pomegranate are your temples behind your veil.
There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
But my dove, my perfect one, is the one, the only one of her mother, the pure of the one who bore her. The daughters saw her and called her blessed, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?
Shulamite: I went down to the garden of nuts to see the greenery of the valley, to see whether the vine had budded and the pomegranates had bloomed.
Before I was even aware, my soul had made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
The Beloved and His Friends: Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may gaze upon you! Shulamite: What would you see in the Shulamite; as it were, the dancing of two armies?
The Beloved: How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skilled artist.
Your navel is like a round goblet; it lacks no mixed wine. Your belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
Your neck is like an ivory tower, your eyes like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
Your head is like Carmel, and the hair of your head is like purple; the king is held captive in its tresses.
How beautiful and how pleasant you are, O love; so exquisite!
Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts like its clusters.
I said, I will go up into the palm tree, I will grasp its stalk. Let now your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your nose like apples,
and the roof of your mouth like excellent wine. Shulamite: The wine goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding gently over the lips into sleep.
I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine has budded, whether the grape blossoms are open, and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give my love to you.
At our door all manner of excellent fragrances for love, new and old, I have treasured up for you, my beloved.
Oh, that you were like my brother, who nursed at my mother’s breasts! If I should find you outside, I would kiss you; I would not be despised.
I would lead you and bring you into my mother’s house, to teach me; I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
To the Daughters of Jerusalem: His left hand under my head, and his right hand embracing me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem: Do not stir up nor awaken love until it pleases.
A Relative: Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree. There your mother travailed with you; there she travailed with you and bore you.
Shulamite to Her Beloved: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm; for love is as strong as death, jealousy as cruel as Sheol; its flames are flames of fire, a flame of YAH.
Many waters cannot quench love, nor can the rivers overflow it. If a man would give for love all the wealth of his house, it would be despised with contempt.
Relatives: We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is spoken for?
If she is a wall, we will build upon her a battlement of silver; and if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
Shulamite: I am a wall, and my breasts like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who found peace.
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon; he leased the vineyard to keepers; everyone was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver.
To Solomon: My own vineyard is before me. You, O Solomon, may have a thousand, and those who tend its fruit two hundred.
The Beloved: You who dwell in the gardens, the companions listen for your voice; let me hear it!
Shulamite: Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
Give heed, O heavens, and hear, O earth! For Jehovah has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against Me.
The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s manger, but Israel does not know; My people have not discerned.
Woe, sinful nation, a people heavy with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who corrupt! They have forsaken Jehovah; they have scorned the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged backward.
Why will you be stricken any more? Will you rebel more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint.
From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it; only wounds and bruises and fresh stripes; they have not been closed nor bound up, nor has it been softened with oil.
Your land is a desolation; your cities burned with fire. Strangers devour your land before you; and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.
Except Jehovah of Hosts had left us a small remnant, we would be as Sodom; we would be as Gomorrah.
Hear the Word of Jehovah, you rulers of Sodom. Give heed to the Law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.
What good to Me are your many sacrifices, says Jehovah? I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of well-fed cattle; nor do I delight in the blood of bulls, of lambs, or he goats.
When you come to appear before Me, who has required this at your hand, to trample My courts?
Bring no more vain sacrifices; its incense is an abomination to Me. I cannot endure the new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, and the wicked festivals.
My soul hates your new moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.
And when you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you. Even though you multiply prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.
Wash yourselves, purify yourselves. Put away the evil of your doings from My eyes; stop doing evil.
Learn to do good, seek justice, set straight the oppressor, judge for the orphan, plead for the widow.
Come now and let us reason together, says Jehovah: Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.
But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.
Oh how the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; righteousness lodged in it; but now, murderers!
Your silver has become dross; your wine is diluted with water.
Your rulers are rebellious and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe, and pursues rewards. They do not judge for the orphan, nor does the cause of the widow come before them.
Therefore says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah! I will be eased of My adversaries, and avenge Myself of My enemies.
And I will turn back My hand upon you, and refine your dross, as with lye, and remove all your alloy.
And I will return your judges as at the first; and your advisers, as at the beginning; then you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.
Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her returning ones with righteousness.
And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together. And those who forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.
For they shall be ashamed of the mighty trees which you desired; and you shall be ashamed of the gardens that you have chosen.
For you shall be like a mighty tree whose leaf fades, and like a garden that has no water.
And the strong shall be as tinder, and the work as a spark; and they both shall burn together; and no one shall quench them.
The Word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
And it shall come to pass in the end times, that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.
And many people shall go and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion the Law shall go forth, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
And He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war anymore.
O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.
For You have forsaken Your people, the house of Jacob, because they have been consecrated from the east, and are fortunetellers like the Philistines, and they clap hands in worship with children of foreigners.
Their land is also filled with silver and gold. There is no end to their treasures. And their land is full of horses, neither is there any end to their chariots.
Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
People prostrate themselves, men bow low; therefore You do not forgive them.
Enter into the rock and hide in the dust from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty.
The lofty eyes of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; but Jehovah, He alone, shall be exalted in that day.
For the day of Jehovah of Hosts shall come upon all the proud and lofty ones, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;
and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan;
and upon all the high mountains; and upon all the lifted up hills;
and upon every tall tower; and upon every fortified wall;
and upon all the ships of Tarshish; and upon all desirable craft.
And the pride of man shall be bowed down; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.
And the idols shall completely pass away.
And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, for the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.
In that day a man shall throw his idols of silver and gold, which they made each man to bow down to, to the moles and to the bats;
to go into the crevices of the rocks, and into the clefts of the cliffs, from the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of His majesty; when He rises up to make the earth tremble.
Leave off from such a man, whose breath is in his nostril; for how is he to be accounted?
For behold, the Lord Jehovah of Hosts takes away the support and the staff from Jerusalem and from Judah; the whole support of bread and the whole support of water;
the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;
the commander of fifty and the honorable man; the counselor and the skilled magician; and the expert enchanter.
And I will give youth to be their rulers, and wanton children shall rule over them.
And the people shall be oppressed, man against man, every man by his neighbor. The youth will be insolent against the elder, and the dishonorable against the honorable.
When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his father’s house, saying, You have clothing! Come, you be our ruler; let this ruin be under your power.
In that day he shall lift himself up and say, I cannot be one who binds up; for there is neither bread nor clothing in my house; do not make me a ruler of the people.
For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their tongue and their deeds are rebellion toward Jehovah and against the eyes of His glory.
The expression of their faces witnesses against them; they have declared their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have recompensed evil upon themselves.
Say to the righteous that it is well; for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.
Woe to the wicked! For the evil, the recompense of his hand, shall be done unto him.
As for My people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O My people, those leading you cause you to go astray, and they swallow the way of your paths.
Jehovah stands up to plead His case, and stands up to judge the peoples.
Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people, and their rulers. For you have eaten up the vineyard, the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
What do you mean that you crush My people, and grind the faces of the poor? says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.
Furthermore Jehovah says, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched out necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and make a tinkling with their feet;
therefore Jehovah will attach scabs to the top of the head of the daughters of Zion; and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.
In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and their headbands, and their crescents of the moon,
the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;
the turbans, and the leg ornaments, and the sashes, and the perfume boxes, and the amulets;
the rings and nose jewels;
the festal apparel and the outer garments; and the mantles, and the purses;
the mirrors and the fine linen; and the turbans and the veils.
And it shall be, instead of a smell of perfume, there shall be an odor of decay. And instead of a belt, a rope. And instead of well set hair, baldness. And instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.
Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall sit desolate on the ground.
And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothing; only let us be called by your name, to take away our reproach.
In that day shall the Branch of Jehovah be beautiful and honorable, and the fruit of the earth excellent and glorious for those who have escaped from Israel.
And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is recorded among the living in Jerusalem;
when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.
And Jehovah will create over all the foundation of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy.
And there shall be a booth for shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from storm and rain.
Now I will sing to my Beloved a song of my Beloved concerning His vineyard. My Beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
And He fenced it, and cleared out its stones, and planted it with choice vines, and built a tower in its midst, and hewed out a winepress in it; and He looked for it to produce grapes, but it produced rotten grapes.
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, please judge between Me and My vineyard.
What more could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why then, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield rotten grapes?
And now I will tell you what I will do to My vineyard; I will take away its hedge, and it shall be burned; and break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down;
and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor dug; but briers and thorns shall come up. And I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are His pleasant plant. He looked for justice, but behold bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold an outcry!
Woe to those who join house to house, laying field to field, until there is no more space for you to dwell alone in the midst of the earth!
Jehovah of Hosts said in my ears, Truly many big and pleasant houses shall be laid waste, without inhabitant.
Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.
Woe to those who rise up early in the morning to pursue strong drink; remaining until the evening while wine inflames them!
And the lute, and the harp, the tambourine, and pipe, and wine, are at their feasts; but they do not regard the work of Jehovah, neither do they give attention to the work of His hands.
For this My people have gone into captivity without knowledge, and their honorable men into famine, and their multitude dried up with thirst.
Therefore Sheol has enlarged itself, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their tumult, and he who exults, shall go down into it.
And people are prostrated, and great men are brought low and the eyes of the haughty are brought low.
But Jehovah of Hosts is exalted in justice, and the Mighty God, the Holy One, is sanctified in righteousness.
Then shall the lambs feed in their pastures, and the waste places of the fat ones shall sojourners eat.
Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin with cart ropes;
who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work, so that we may see it; and let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, so that we may know it!
Woe to those who call evil good and good evil; who put darkness for light and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and understanding in their own sight!
Woe to those mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mix strong drink;
who justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away justice from the righteous!
Therefore, as the fire devours the stubble, and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be like rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up like dust, because they have cast away the Law of Jehovah of Hosts, and despised the Word of the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore the anger of Jehovah is kindled against His people, and He has stretched out His hand against them, and has stricken them; and the hills trembled, and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
And He will lift up a banner to distant nations, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed, swiftly.
No one shall be weary nor stumble among them; no one shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the waistband of their loins be loosened, nor the thong of their sandals be broken;
whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hooves seem like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
Their roaring shall be like a lion; they shall roar like young lions; and they shall roar and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and no one shall deliver it.
And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if one looks to the land, behold darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by clouds.
In the year that King Uzziah died I then saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.
Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of Hosts; the whole earth full of His glory!
And the doorposts shook at the voice of the one who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
Then I said, Woe is me! for I am undone! for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Hosts.
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from off the altar.
And he applied it to my mouth and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged.
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then I said, Here am I! Send me.
And He said, Go, and tell this people, You listen to hear, but do not understand; you look to see, but do not perceive.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn back, and be healed.
Then I said, Lord, how long? And He answered, Until the cities have been smashed to ruins without inhabitant, and the houses without a man, and the land is left devastated,
and until Jehovah has sent the men far away, and the desolation in the midst of the land is great.
But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return and be consumed like the terebinth and like the oak when it is cut down, whose stump remains. The holy seed is its stump.
And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to make war against it, but could not prevail against it.
And it was told to the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are swayed by the wind.
Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field.
And say to him, Take care and be quiet. Do not fear, nor be softhearted because of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin from Syria, and of the son of Remaliah;
because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying,
Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and break through the wall for ourselves, and set a king in the midst of it, the son of Tabeel.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.
For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken so that it shall not be a people.
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.
Furthermore Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.
But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I tempt Jehovah.
And He said, Hear now, O house of David; is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?
Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel.
Butter and honey He shall eat until He knows to refuse the evil and choose the good.
For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you loathe shall be forsaken by both its kings.
Jehovah shall bring upon you, and upon your people, and upon your father’s house, days that have not come since the days that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall whistle for the fly at the ends of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
And they shall come, and all of them shall rest in the steep valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all the thorns, and on all the pastures.
In the same day the Lord shall shave with a hired razor, with those beyond the River, with the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet, and it shall also snatch away the beard.
And it shall be in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep;
so it will be that, from the abundance of milk which they shall give, that He shall eat butter; for everyone who is left in the land shall eat butter and honey.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, it shall even be for briers and thorns.
With arrows and with bows, men shall come there, because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
And all hills which were hoed with the hoe, you shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be a place to turn the ox loose, and for sheep to trample.
And Jehovah said to me, Take a large scroll and write in it with a man’s pen: Maher-shalal-hash-baz. (which means, Hurry to the plunder! Make haste to the spoils!)
And I took to myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
And I went in to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
Jehovah also spoke to me again saying,
Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;
therefore behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and abundant, even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks.
And he shall pass through Judah. He shall overflow and go over; he shall reach to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.
Suffer evil, O people, and be broken! Give ear, all you from distant lands. Gird yourselves and be broken. Gird yourselves and be broken!
Take counsel and make plans, but they will be frustrated. Speak a word, but it shall not stand; for the Mighty God is with us.
For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and warned me against walking in the way of this people, saying,
Do not say, A conspiracy! to everything which this people calls, A conspiracy! And do not be afraid with their fear, nor be terrified.
Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts Himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.
And He shall be a sanctuary for you; but a stone of stumbling, and a rock of falling to both the houses of Israel; and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
Bind up the testimony, seal the Law among My disciples.
And I will wait on Jehovah, who hides His face from the house of Jacob; and I will watch for Him.
Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of Hosts who dwells in Mount Zion.
And when they say to you, Consult the sorcerers and fortunetellers who peep and mutter; should not a people inquire of their God, rather than the living of the dead?
To the Law and to the Testimony! If they do not speak according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them.
And they shall pass through it, hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, that they shall be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
And they shall look to the land; and behold, trouble and darkness and gloom of anguish! And they shall be thrust into darkness.
Nevertheless the gloom shall not be upon her who was in distress, as in the former time when He brought contempt upon the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali. For afterwards He will glorify the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shined.
You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy. They rejoice before You according to the joy at harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoils.
For You have broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his taskmaster, as in the day of Midian.
For every trembling boot of the warrior, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be fuel for burning in the fire.
For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Strong and Mighty God, The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of His government and peace upon the throne of David there will be no end; and upon His kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from now on, even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish this.
The Lord sent a Word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel.
And all the people shall know; Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and insolence of heart,
The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will use cedars instead.
Therefore Jehovah shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and spur his enemies on;
the Syrians in front and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
For the people do not turn to Him who strikes them, nor do they seek Jehovah of Hosts.
Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and bulrush, in one day.
The elder and honorable, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.
For the leaders of this people lead them astray; and those who are led by them are swallowed up.
Therefore the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, nor shall He have mercy on their orphans and widows; for everyone is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
For wickedness burns like the fire; it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall billow up in a column of smoke.
Through the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts the land is scorched, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire; no man shall have compassion on his brother.
And he shall cut off on the right hand and be hungry; and he shall devour on the left, and they shall not be satisfied. Each man shall eat the flesh of his own arm;
Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and together they shall be against Judah. In all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and who have written and continue to write toil;
to thrust aside the needy from judgment, and to rob the right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may plunder the orphans!
And what will you do in the day of judgment, and in destruction when it comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? And where will you leave your glory?
Without Me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. In all this His hand is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still.
Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger! And the staff in their hand is My indignation.
I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of My wrath. I will command him to draw out the plunder, and to seize the spoils, and to trample them like the mud of the streets.
Yet he does not plan this, nor does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off not a few nations.
For he says, Are not my commanders all like kings?
Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?
As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose graven images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Samaria and her idols?
And it shall come to pass, when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, that He will say, I will punish the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of his haughty looks.
For he says, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am discerning. And I have removed the borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.
And my hand has found, as a nest, the riches of the people; and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have gathered all the earth; and there was no one who moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
Shall the ax boast itself against him who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who moves it? As if the rod could swing itself at those who lift it up! As if a staff could rise up, as though it were not wood!
Therefore the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall send leanness among his fat ones; and under his glory He shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and His Holy One as a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.
And it shall burn up the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a sick one faints.
And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be so few, that a child might write them.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob, shall never again lean on him who struck them; but will truly lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.
The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Strong and Mighty God.
For though Your people Israel are like the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the completion which is decreed shall overflow with righteousness.
For the Lord Jehovah of Hosts shall make a full end, as ordained, in the midst of all the land.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, O my people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria. He shall strike you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, in the way of Egypt.
But yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease, and My anger shall be for their destruction.
And Jehovah of Hosts shall stir up a scourge upon him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as His staff was on the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt.
And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
He has come to Aiath, he has passed to Migron; at Michmash he has stored his equipment;
they have gone over the pass; they have taken lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid, Gibeah of Saul has fled.
Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish; O poor Anathoth.
Madmenah has fled; the inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.
Yet he shall remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his fist against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Behold, the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shall lop off the bough with terror; and those exalted high shall be chopped down, and the haughty shall be humbled.
And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by the Mighty One.
And a Branch shall go out from the trunk of Jesse, and a Shoot shall grow out of his roots.
And the Spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah.
And He shall savor the fear of Jehovah. And He shall not judge according to the sight of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears.
But with righteousness He shall judge the poor, and shall decide with equity for the meek of the earth. And He shall strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked.
And righteousness shall be the waistband of His loins, and faithfulness the waistband of His heart.
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And the nursing child shall play near the hole of the adder, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the viper’s den.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
And in that day there shall be the Root of Jesse, standing as a banner for the people; to Him the nations shall resort; and His resting place shall be glorious.
And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall again set His hand the second time to recover the remnant of His people who remain, from Assyria and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
And He shall lift up a banner for the nations, and shall gather the outcasts of Israel and gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
And the envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not distress Ephraim.
But they shall swoop down upon the shoulders of the Philistines to the west; they shall plunder the children of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.
And Jehovah shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Sea of Egypt; and with His scorching wind He shall shake His fist over the River, and shall strike it into seven streams, and make men tread it dry-shod.
And there shall be a highway for the remnant of His people, those left as survivors from Assyria; as it was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
And in that day you shall say, O Jehovah, I will praise You; though You were angry with me, Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.
Behold, the Mighty God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid; for YAH JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; He also has become my salvation.
And with joy you shall draw water out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day you shall say, Praise Jehovah! Call upon His name; declare His doings among the people, make mention that His name is exalted.
Make music unto Jehovah; for He has done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.
Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in your midst!
The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:
Lift up a banner on the bare mountain, raise the voice to them; wave the hand, so that they may enter the gates of the nobles.
I have commanded My consecrated ones; I have also called My mighty ones for My anger, those who rejoice in My majesty.
The sound of a multitude in the mountains, as of many people! A tumultuous sound of the kingdoms of nations gathered together! Jehovah of Hosts musters the army for battle.
They come from a distant land, from the ends of the heavens; Jehovah and the weapons of His indignation, to destroy the whole land.
Howl! For the day of Jehovah is at hand! It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
Therefore all hands shall be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt;
and they shall be afraid. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. They shall writhe like a woman giving birth. They shall be amazed at one another; their faces like flames.
Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel and with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land waste; and He shall destroy its sinners out of it.
For the stars of the heavens and their constellations shall not give light; the sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not shine its light.
And I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. And I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud, and will lay low the haughtiness of the tyrants.
I will make mortal man more precious than refined gold; even mankind than the pure gold of Ophir.
Thus I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall move out of its place, in the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.
And it shall be as a hunted gazelle, and as a sheep that no man takes up; each man shall turn to his own people, and everyone flee into his own land.
Everyone who is found shall be thrust through; and everyone who is captured shall fall by the sword.
Their children shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be plundered, and their wives ravished.
Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not value silver; and they shall not delight in gold.
Their bows shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the majestic beauty of Chaldea, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
It shall nevermore be inhabited, nor shall it be lived in from generation to generation; nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there; nor shall the shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
But the wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of howling creatures; and young owls shall dwell there, and wild goats shall skip about.
And howling beasts shall respond from desolate places, and dragons in the delightful palaces. Indeed, her time will soon come to pass, and her days shall not be prolonged.
For Jehovah will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel and settle them in their own land; and the sojourner shall be joined with them, and they shall cling to the house of Jacob.
And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of Jehovah for servants and maids. And they shall make captives of their captors; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
And it shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give you rest from your sorrow, and from your fear, and from the hard service with which you were worked,
that you shall take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say, How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!
Jehovah has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers
who struck peoples in wrath, strokes without letup, ruling the nations in anger, a persecution without restraint.
The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they break forth into singing.
Yea, the noble trees rejoice over you, the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since you have been laid down, no woodcutter comes up against us.
Sheol from below is excited over you, to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the dead for you, all the chief of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
All of them shall speak and say to you, Are you also as weak as we? Have you become like us?
Your arrogance is brought down to Sheol, and the noise of your lutes. The maggot is spread under you, and the worms cover you.
How you are fallen from the heavens, O shining one, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, you who weakened the nations!
For you have said in your heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the stars of the Mighty God; I will also sit on the mount of the appointed assembly, in the recesses of the north.
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.
Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the recesses of the Pit.
Those who see you shall stare at you and consider diligently, saying, Is this the man who made the earth to tremble; who shook kingdoms;
who made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed its cities; who did not open the house for his prisoners?
All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.
But you are cast out of your grave like an abhorred branch, and like the apparel of those who are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; like a carcass trampled under foot.
You shall not be joined with them in burial, because you destroyed your land and killed your people; the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.
Prepare slaughter for his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, so that they may not rise nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
For I will rise up against them, says Jehovah of Hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, and offspring, and posterity, says Jehovah.
I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog, and marshes of muddy water; and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Jehovah of Hosts has sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so it shall come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it shall stand;
to break Assyria in My land, and on My mountains to trample him under foot. Then his yoke shall be removed from them, and his burden shall be taken from off their shoulders.
This is the purpose that is purposed upon all the earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.
For Jehovah of Hosts has purposed, and who shall annul it? And His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
This burden was in the year that King Ahaz died:
Rejoice not, all you of Philistia, because the rod that struck you is broken; for a viper comes forth from the root of the serpent, and his offspring shall be a fiery flying serpent.
And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and he shall slay your remnant.
Howl, O gate! Cry, O city! O Philistia, all of you are melted away; for from the north a smoke comes, with no straggler in his ranks.
What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That Jehovah has founded Zion, and the poor of His people shall take refuge in it.
The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste; it is cut off.
One has gone up to the house, even to Dibon, the high places, to weep. Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba; baldness shall be on all their heads, and every beard cut off.
In the streets they shall clothe themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets everyone shall howl, weeping bitterly.
And Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry for help; their voice shall be heard as far as Jahaz. So the armed soldiers of Moab shall shout; he trembles for his life.
My heart shall call out to Moab; his fugitives flee to Zoar like a three year old heifer. He goes up the ascent to Luhith with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up an outcry of destruction.
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate; for the grass has dried up and the new grass fails; there is nothing green.
Therefore they shall carry off the abundance they have produced and stored, over to the Brook of the Willows.
For the cry has gone around all the borders of Moab, its howling even to Eglaim; its howling even to Beer-elim.
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, for I will lay more upon Dimon; upon the escapees of Moab, lions, even upon the remnant of the land.
Send the lamb to the ruler of the land, from Sela of the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.
For it shall be as a fluttering bird cast out of the nest; so it shall be for the daughters of Moab at the fords of Arnon.
Take counsel, execute judgment; make your shadow as night in the middle of the day; hide the outcasts; do not betray the one who flees.
Let My outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be a shelter to them from the face of the destroyer; for the extortioner is at an end, the destroyer ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
And in mercy the throne shall be established; and One shall sit on it in truth in the tent of David, judging and seeking swift justice in righteousness.
We have heard of the pride of Moab; very proud; even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his rage; but it is all empty talk.
Therefore Moab shall howl for Moab, everyone shall howl. You shall mourn for the foundations of Kir-hareseth; surely they are stricken.
For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have beat down its choice plants which have come to Jazer, and wandered in the wilderness; her branches are stretched out, they have crossed over the sea.
Therefore I will bewail the vine of Sibmah with the weeping of Jazer. I will drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouting for your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen short.
Gladness and joy are removed out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing and no shouting. The treader shall tread out no wine in the presses; I have made their shouting to cease.
Therefore my stomach shall growl like a harp for Moab, and my inner being for Kir-heres.
And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not have enough strength.
This is the Word which Jehovah has spoken to Moab since that time.
But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, like the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be disgraced with all that great multitude; and the little remnant shall be few, not mighty.
The burden against Damascus: Behold, Damascus is removed from being a city, and it shall be a heap of ruins.
The cities of Aroer are forsaken; now they are for flocks which lie down, and no one makes them afraid.
And the fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the rest of Syria. They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, says Jehovah of Hosts.
And it shall come to pass in that day that the glory of Jacob shall be laid low, and the fatness of his flesh shall be made lean.
And it shall be as the gathering of grain at harvest, and his arm reaps the heads of grain. And it shall be as he who gathers heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, like the shaking of an olive tree, where two or three ripe olives are in the top of the uppermost branch, with four or five in the fruitful branches of it, says Jehovah the God of Israel.
In that day a man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor respect that which his fingers have made, neither the groves nor idols.
In that day his strong cities shall be like a forsaken branch, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel; and it shall become a desolation.
Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the Rock of your strength, therefore you shall plant pleasant plants and shall set strange shoots.
In the day you shall fence in your planting; and in the morning you shall make your seed sprout. But the harvest shall be a heap in the day of sickness and incurable pain.
Woe to the multitude of many people, who make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations who make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!
The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters; but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far away, and shall be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the tempest.
At evening time, behold, terror! Before the morning, he is no more! This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot of those who rob us.
Woe to the land of whirring wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia,
which sends ambassadors by sea, even in vessels of reed on the waters, saying, Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people to be feared until now and onward; a mighty nation, treading underfoot; whose land the rivers have divided!
All you inhabitants of the world and you dwelling on the earth, you see when he lifts up a banner on the mountains. And you hear when he blows the shofar.
For thus Jehovah said to me, I will take My rest, and I will look on from My dwelling place, like radiant heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, then He will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.
They shall be left together to the birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the birds shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.
In that time the present shall be brought to Jehovah of Hosts from a nation tall and smooth, from a people to be feared until now and onward; a mighty nation, treading underfoot; whose land the rivers have divided; to the place of the name of Jehovah of Hosts, Mount Zion.
The burden against Egypt: Behold, Jehovah rides on a swift cloud and comes into Egypt. And the idols of Egypt shall tremble at His presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in its midst.
And I will set Egyptians against Egyptians; and they shall fight each man against his brother, and each against his neighbor; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy their counsel. And they shall inquire of the idols, and the sorcerers, and the mediums, and the fortunetellers.
And I will give Egypt over into the hand of a cruel master; and a fierce king shall rule over them, says the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts.
And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
And rivers shall be odious from the stench; the Nile of Egypt will languish and dry up; the reeds and the rushes shall wither.
Bare places by the Nile, by the mouth of the Nile; and everything sown by the Nile shall dry up, be driven away, and be no more.
The fishermen also shall mourn, and all who drop a hook into the Nile shall lament, and those who spread nets on the waters shall grow feeble.
And those who work in fine flax, and those who weave white cloth shall be ashamed.
And her foundations shall be broken, and all who make wages shall be troubled in soul.
Surely the rulers of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?
Where are they? Where are your wise men? And let them tell you now, and let them know what Jehovah of Hosts has advised against Egypt.
The rulers of Zoan have become fools, the rulers of Noph are deceived; they have also misled Egypt, the chief of her tribes.
Jehovah has mixed a perverse spirit in its midst; and they have caused Egypt to err in all its work, like a drunkard staggers in his vomit.
And Egypt shall have no work that the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
In that day Egypt shall be like women; and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of Hosts, which He shakes over it.
And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt; everyone who mentions it shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of Jehovah of Hosts which He has devised against it.
In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan and swear to Jehovah of Hosts; one shall be called the City of Destruction.
In that day there shall be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at its border.
And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of Hosts in the land of Egypt. For they shall cry unto Jehovah because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a deliverer, even a great one, and shall deliver them.
And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and Egypt shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall offer sacrifice and offering; and they shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and make good.
And Jehovah shall strike Egypt; He shall strike and heal; and they shall return to Jehovah, and He will be entreated by them and heal them.
In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria shall come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.
In that day Israel shall be one of three with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;
whom Jehovah of Hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be My people Egypt, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.
In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and fought against Ashdod and took it;
at that time Jehovah spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loosen the sackcloth off your loins, and take your sandal off your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.
And Jehovah said, Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years, as a sign and wonder to Egypt and Ethiopia;
so shall the king of Assyria lead away Egypt as captives, and Ethiopia as exiles, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with buttocks stripped bare, to the indecent exposure of Egypt.
And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their confidence, and of Egypt their glory.
And the inhabitant of this region shall say in that day, Behold our confidence to which we have fled for help, to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And now, how shall we escape?
The burden against the wilderness of the sea: As tempests in the south pass through, so it comes from the wilderness, from a dreadful land.
An intense vision is declared to me: The deceiver deals treacherously, and the plunderer devastates. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media! I have caused all her sighing to cease.
Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold on me like the pangs of a woman in labor. I am bent over from hearing it; I am dismayed from seeing it.
My heart has wandered, terror overwhelms me; the twilight I longed for He has turned into trembling.
Prepare the table, keep watch in the watchtower, eat, drink. Arise, you rulers, and anoint the shield.
For thus Jehovah has said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he sees.
And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, a chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel. And he paid attention and listened with great diligence.
And he cried out, A lion! My lord, I stand continually on the watchtower by day, and I am stationed at my post all the nights.
And behold, here comes a chariot with a man, and a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon has fallen, has fallen! And all the graven images of her gods He has smashed to the ground.
O my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.
The burden against Dumah: He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night; if you will inquire, inquire; come, return.
The burden against Arabia: You shall lodge in the forest of Arabia, O traveling companies of Dedanites.
The people of the land of Tema have brought water to him who was thirsty; they have met him who fled with their bread.
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the vehemence of war.
For Jehovah has said to me, Within a year, according to the year of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;
and the rest of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished; for Jehovah the God of Israel, has spoken.
The burden against the Valley of Vision. What ails you now, that you have gone up to the housetops?
The noisy city, the joyous city, is filled with turbulence. Your slain ones are not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.
All your rulers have fled together; they have been captured without the bow; all who are found in you have been captured together; they have fled from afar.
Therefore I said, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly; do not insist on comforting me because of the devastation of the daughter of my people.
For it is a day of trouble, and of trampling down, and of perplexity by Jehovah of Hosts in the Valley of Vision; of breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.
And Elam carried the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
And it shall come to pass that your choicest valleys shall be full of chariots; and the horsemen shall surely be set in array at the gate.
And he uncovered Judah’s covering, and you looked in that day to the armor of the House of the Forest.
You have also seen the breaks in the city of David, that they are many; and you gathered the waters of the lower pool.
And you have counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you have broken down the houses to fortify the wall.
You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool; but you have not looked to its Maker, nor had regard for Him who formed it long ago.
And in that day Jehovah of Hosts called for weeping and mourning, and for baldness, and for girding with sackcloth.
But behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine, saying, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!
And it was revealed in my ears by Jehovah of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be atoned until you die, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, Depart, go to this steward, to Shebna who is over the house, and say,
What have you here? And who is here with you, that you have hewn out a tomb for yourself here, as one who proudly hews for himself a tomb, who carves out a dwelling place for himself in a rock?
Behold, Jehovah will cast you away into captivity, O mighty man, and will grasp and wrap you up.
He will wind up and whirl you like a ball into a large land; there you shall die, and there the chariots of your glory shall be the shame of your master’s house.
And I will drive you from your position, and he will tear you down from your station.
And in that day it shall be that I will call My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah;
and I will clothe him with your robe, and will strengthen him with your sash, and I will entrust your rule into his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; so he shall open, and no one shall shut; and he shall shut, and no one shall open.
And I will fasten him as a peg in a firm place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father’s house.
And they shall hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the offshoots, all insignificant vessels, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of jars.
In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, the peg that is fastened in the firm place shall be removed, and be cut down and fall. And the burden that was on it shall be cut off; for Jehovah has spoken.
The burden against Tyre: Howl, ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, merchants of Sidon, who pass over the sea. They have filled you.
And by great waters, the seed of Sihor and the harvest of the River was her revenue; and she is a marketplace for the nations.
Be ashamed, O Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed nor brought forth. I have not nourished young men nor raised up virgins.
As the report comes to Egypt, so they shall be writhing in pain at the report of Tyre.
Pass over to Tarshish. Howl, you inhabitants of the coast!
Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is from ancient days; whose feet carried it to distant lands to sojourn?
Who has advised this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are rulers, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?
Jehovah of Hosts has counseled it, to dishonor the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
Pass through your land like a river, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no more strength.
He stretched out His hand over the sea; He shook the kingdoms. Jehovah has given a command against the merchant city, to destroy its strongholds.
And He said, You shall rejoice no more, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim; there also you shall have no rest.
Behold the land of the Chaldeans, this people which did not exist. Assyria founded it for those who live in the desert. They set up their siege-towers; they stripped its palaces; they made it a ruin.
Howl, ships of Tarshish! For your strength is laid waste.
And in that day Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it shall be for Tyre as the song of a harlot.
Take a harp, go about the city, O harlot who has been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs so that you may be remembered.
And it shall be after the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.
And her goods and her wages shall be set apart to Jehovah. It shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her goods shall be for those who dwell before Jehovah, to eat enough, and for fine clothing.
Behold, Jehovah empties the earth and makes it bare, and distorts its face, and scatters its inhabitants.
And as it is with the people, so it shall be with the priest; as with the servant, so with the master; as with the maid, so it is with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the creditor, so with the debtor.
The land shall be completely emptied, and utterly plundered; for Jehovah has spoken this Word.
The earth mourns and fades away; the world droops and fades away; the haughty people of the earth grow feeble.
The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, and have broken the perpetual covenant.
Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell in it are held guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.
The new wine mourns, the vine droops, all the merry-hearted sigh.
The mirth of the tambourines ceases; the tumult of the jubilant ends; the joy of the harp ceases.
They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to those who drink it.
The city of emptiness is broken down; every house is shut up so that no one may come in.
There is a cry for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land has gone.
Desolation is left in the city, and the gate is battered and destroyed.
For so it is in the midst of the land among the people. It shall be like the shaking of an olive tree, and as gleanings of grapes when the vintage has been finished.
They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of Jehovah, they shall cry aloud from the sea.
Therefore glorify Jehovah in the light of the fire, the name of the Lord Jehovah of Israel from the seashores.
From the ends of the earth we have heard songs, glory to the righteous. But I said, Leanness to me! Leanness to me! Woe to me! Deceivers deceive, even with treachery. Deceivers deceive!
Terror and the pit and the snare are upon you, O inhabitant of the earth.
And it shall be that he who flees from the sound of terror shall fall into the pit. And he who comes up out of the midst of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For the windows from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth quake.
The earth has been badly broken! The earth is split open and cracked through! The earth has shaken greatly and is tottering!
Like a drunkard the earth is staggering back and forth! And it sways to and fro like a hut! Its transgressions have been heavy upon it; and it shall fall and not rise again.
And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah will punish the host of the haughty ones on high; and on earth, the kings of the earth.
And they shall be gathered, as prisoners are gathered in a dungeon. And they shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be visited.
Then the moon shall be abashed, and the sun shall be ashamed, when Jehovah of Hosts shall reign on Mount Zion, in Jerusalem, and before His elders, in splendor.
O Jehovah, You are my God; I will exalt You, I will praise Your name; for You have done wonders; Your counsels of old are steadfast faithfulness.
For You have made a city into a heap; a fortified city into a ruin; a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be rebuilt.
Therefore the strong people glorify You; the city of the ruthless nations shall fear You.
For You are a refuge to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the ruthless ones is like a storm against the wall.
You shall subdue the roaring of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud. The shouting of the terrible ones shall be pruned away.
And on this mountain Jehovah of Hosts will make a feast of fatness for all the people, a feast of the dregs of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of the dregs of refined wine.
And He will destroy on this mountain the surface of the covering wrapped over all people, and the veil that is woven over all nations.
He will swallow up death forever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces. And He will take away from all the earth the rebuke of His people. For Jehovah has spoken.
And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God. We have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is Jehovah; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.
For the hand of Jehovah shall rest on this mountain, and Moab shall be trampled under Him, even as straw is trampled in the water of a dung pit.
And He shall spread out His hands in their midst, as he who swims strokes to swim. And He will bring down their pride along with the deceit of their hands.
And the fortress of the high fort of your walls He will lay low, bring down to the ground, to the dust.
In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; He sets up salvation as our walls and bulwarks.
Open the gates, that the righteous nation, keeping faithfulness, may enter in.
You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You; because he trusts in You.
Trust in Jehovah forever; for in YAH JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.
For He brings down those who dwell on high; He lays low the lofty city; He lays it low, even to the ground; He brings it down to the dust.
The foot shall trample it, the feet of the poor and the steps of the weak.
The way of the just is equity; O Upright One, You weigh the path of the just.
Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for You; for the desire of our soul is Your name and the remembrance of You.
With my soul I have desired You in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I will seek You early; for when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.
Jehovah, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy toward the people. Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them.
Jehovah, You will establish peace for us; for You have also done all our works in us.
O Jehovah our God, masters besides You have had the rule over us; but by You only will we make mention of Your name.
Those who are dead do not live; spirits of the dead do not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.
You have increased the nation, O Jehovah, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have extended it to the ends of the earth.
Jehovah, in trouble they have visited You; they have poured out a prayer when Your chastening was upon them.
As a woman with child draws near to giving birth, she writhes and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in Your sight, O Jehovah.
We have conceived; we have writhed in pain; but we have given birth (as it were) to wind. We have not produced any salvation in the earth; nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen out in birth.
Your dead ones shall live, together with My dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is as the dew of the light, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
Come, my people, enter into your rooms and shut your doors behind you; hide (as it were) for a few moments, until the indignation has passed.
For behold, Jehovah comes out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
In that day Jehovah with His great and fierce and strong sword shall punish Leviathan, the fleeing serpent; Leviathan, that twisted serpent; and He shall kill the dragon in the sea.
In that day sing to her, a vineyard of desirable wine.
I, Jehovah, keep it; I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
Fury is not in Me; who would set the briers and thorns against Me in battle? I would march through them; I would burn them together.
Or let them take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.
He shall cause those who come from Jacob to take root; Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
Has He struck him, as He struck those who struck Him? Is He slain according to the slaughter of those slain by Him?
In driving and sending her away, you contend with her. He removes His fierce wind, in the day of the east wind.
Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be atoned; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces, the groves and idols shall not stand.
Yet the fortified city shall be desolate, and the dwelling forsaken and left like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and there shall it lie down and finish off its branches.
When its branches are dried up, they shall be broken off; the women come and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding. Therefore He who made them will not have mercy on them, and He who formed them will show them no favor.
And it shall be in that day that Jehovah will thresh from the flowing stream to the river of Egypt, and you shall be gathered one by one, O children of Israel.
And it shall be in that day that the great shofar shall be blown, and those about to perish in the land of Assyria shall come, along with the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which is at the head of the lush valleys of those who are overcome with wine!
Behold, the Lord is a mighty and strong one, like a hailstorm, a destroying storm; like a flood of mighty waters overflowing, He casts down to the earth with the hand.
The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trampled under foot;
and the glorious beauty at the head of the lush valley shall be a fading flower, and as the first-ripe fruit before the summer; which, the one looking at it swallows up while it is yet in his hand.
In that day Jehovah of Hosts shall be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty to the rest of His people,
and for a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and for strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink have gone astray. The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink; they are swallowed up by wine; they have gone astray through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; no place is clean.
To whom shall He teach knowledge? And whom shall He make to understand the message? Those weaned from the milk and removed from the breasts.
For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little;
for with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people.
To whom He said, This is the rest; cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing. Yet they were not willing to hear.
But the Word of Jehovah was to them, Precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little; that they might go and fall backward, and be broken and snared and caught.
Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, you scornful men who rule this people in Jerusalem.
Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we have made an agreement with Sheol; when the overflowing scourge shall have gone and passed through, it shall not come upon us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I have founded in Zion a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Cornerstone, a sure Foundation; he who trusts in It shall not be anxious.
Also I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
And your covenant with death shall be covered over, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overwhelming scourge shall pass through, then you shall be trampled down by it.
From the time that it goes out it shall take you; for morning by morning it shall pass over, by day and by night; and it shall be a terror just to understand the report.
For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the cover is too narrow to wrap oneself in it.
For Jehovah shall rise up as at Mount Perazim; He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon, so that He may do His deeds, His strange deeds; and bring to pass His works, His unusual works.
So then do not be mockers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of Hosts that an annihilation is decreed upon the whole earth.
Give ear and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.
Does the plowman plow all day to sow? Does he loosen and harrow his ground?
When he has leveled its surface, does he not scatter the black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, and plant the wheat in rows and mark off the barley and spelt in their boundaries?
For God instructs him to do right; and teaches him.
For the black cumin is not threshed with a threshing instrument, nor is a cart wheel turned on cumin; but the black cumin is beaten out with a stick and the cumin with a rod.
Bread flour is ground. But one does not continue treading and threshing it; nor does he destroy it with his cart wheel; nor pulverize it with his horse.
This also comes forth from Jehovah of Hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excels in sound wisdom.
Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! Snatch away year after year; let the feasts come around.
Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow; and it shall be to me as Ariel.
And I will encamp against you all around, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise siege works against you.
And you shall be brought down; you shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be like a medium out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.
And the multitude of your strangers shall be like fine dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away; yea, it shall be in an instant, suddenly.
You shall be visited by Jehovah of Hosts with thunder, and with earthquake and loud sounds, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.
And the multitude of all the nations who fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, shall be like a dream of a night vision.
It shall even be as when a hungry one dreams, and behold, he eats, but he awakes and his soul is still empty; or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks, but he awakes, and behold, he is still faint and his soul craves. So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations who fight against mount Zion.
Wait and wonder! Smear your eyes shut, blind! They have become drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
For Jehovah has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes; He has covered the prophets and your heads, the seers.
And the vision of all has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which they give to one who is literate saying, Please read this; and he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.
And the book is delivered to him who is not literate, saying, Please read this; and he says, I am not literate.
Therefore Jehovah said, Whereas this people draw near with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but have removed their hearts far from Me, and their fear toward Me is taught by the commandment of men;
therefore, behold, I will again do among this people something extraordinary and wonderful. For the wisdom of their wise ones shall perish, and the understanding of their intelligent ones shall be hidden.
Woe to those who are profound to hide their counsel from Jehovah! And their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? And, Who knows us?
O your perversity! Shall the former be esteemed as the potter’s clay; for shall the product say of him who made it, He did not make me? Or shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, He has had no understanding?
Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.
And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of their gloom and darkness.
And the meek shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is destroyed, and all who look after iniquity are cut off;
those who induce a man to sin by a word, and lay a snare for the judge in the gate, and turn aside the just for vanity.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now become pale.
But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
Those who erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmured shall learn doctrine.
Woe to the rebellious children, says Jehovah, who take counsel, but not of Me; and who pour out drink offerings, but not of My Spirit; that they sweep away sin after sin;
who set out to go down to Egypt and have not asked at My mouth, to strengthen themselves in the refuge of Pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!
Therefore the refuge of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt shall be your reproach.
For his rulers were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.
They were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them, nor be a help nor gain, but a shame and also a reproach.
The burden concerning the beasts of the south. Into the land of trouble and anguish, from where the lioness and the lion come; the viper, and the fiery flying serpent; they carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that cannot profit them.
For Egypt helps in vain, and unto emptiness. Therefore I have proclaimed concerning this, Their arrogance will be to sit still.
Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and note it in a book, so that it may be for time to come forever and ever,
that this is a rebellious people, lying children; children who will not hear the Law of Jehovah;
who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deception;
turn away from the path, thrust aside from the way, desist from the Holy One of Israel from before us.
Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you have despised this Word, and trust in oppression and perversity, and lean on them;
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, a bulge in a high wall, whose crashing comes suddenly in an instant.
And He shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces. He shall not spare, so that there shall not be found in the fragments of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to take water out of the cistern.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you shall be saved; and in quietness and confidence shall be your strength. But you were not willing.
But you said, No; for we will flee on horses. Therefore you shall flee. And you said, We will ride on the swift; therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.
One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five you shall flee, until you are left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as a sign on a hill.
And so Jehovah waits to be gracious to you. And therefore He is exalted, that He may have mercy on you; for Jehovah is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for Him.
For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When He hears it, He will answer you.
And though Jehovah gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers shall not be removed into a corner any more, but your eyes shall see your teachers.
And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk in it, when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left.
You shall also defile the covering of your graven images of silver, and the ornament of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away like a menstruous cloth. You shall say to them, Get away!
Then He shall give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground. And the bread of the produce of the earth also shall be fat and plentiful. In that day your cattle shall feed in large pastures.
Also the oxen and the young asses that plow the ground shall eat cured fodder, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.
And there shall be on every high mountain, and on every high hill, rivers, streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.
And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound.
Behold, the name of Jehovah comes from afar, burning with His anger, and the burden of it is heavy; His lips are full of indignation, and His tongue like a devouring fire.
And like an overflowing stream, His breath shall reach up to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity. And there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to go astray.
You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is consecrated; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come into the mountain of Jehovah, to the Mighty One of Israel.
And Jehovah shall cause His glorious voice to be heard, and shall cause to be seen the bringing down of His arm, with raging anger and flame of a devouring fire, with driving storm, cloudburst and hailstones.
For through the voice of Jehovah, Assyria shall be beaten down, as struck with a rod.
And in every place where the appointed staff shall pass, which Jehovah shall lay upon him, it shall be with tambourines and harps. In war with brandishing He will engage the battle.
For Tophet was arranged in order of old; yea, for the king it is prepared. He has made it deep and large. He makes a fire with much wood. The breath of Jehovah kindles it like a torrent of brimstone.
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and lean on horses and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are so very strong; but they do not look to the Holy One of Israel, nor do they seek Jehovah!
Yet He also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back His Words, but will arise against the house of evildoers and against the help of those who work iniquity.
Now Egypt is a man, and not the Mighty God; and their horses are flesh, and not Spirit. When Jehovah shall stretch out His hand, both he who helps shall fall, and he who is helped shall fall down, and they shall all be finished together.
For thus has Jehovah spoken to me: As the lion roars, and the young lion over his prey when a multitude of shepherds are summoned against him (he will not be afraid of their voice, nor fret himself because of their noise), so Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for its hill.
As birds flying, so Jehovah of Hosts will defend Jerusalem; also defending, He will deliver it; and passing over He will preserve it.
Return to Him, against whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.
For in that day every man shall reject his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made for you, a sin.
Then Assyria shall fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him. For he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall become forced labor.
And he shall pass over to his stronghold for fear, and his rulers shall be afraid of the banner, says Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem.
Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and rulers shall rule with justice.
And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a shelter from the tempest, like streams of water in a dry place, like the shade of a huge rock in a weary land.
And the eyes of those who see shall not be dim, and the ears of those who hear shall listen.
And the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of those who stutter shall be ready to speak plainly.
The fool shall no more be called noble, nor the miser said to be bountiful.
For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity; to practice hypocrisy and to speak error against Jehovah, to empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to be lacking.
Also the implements of the scoundrel are evil; he devises wicked plans to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks justice.
But the noble devises noble things; and by noble things he shall stand.
Rise up, you women who are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; listen to my speech.
Many days and years you shall be troubled, you careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.
Tremble, you women at ease; be troubled, you careless ones; strip yourselves and make yourselves bare, and gird sackcloth on your loins.
They shall mourn for the breasts, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
On the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city;
because the palaces shall be abandoned, the multitude of the city shall be deserted. Instead, the mound and tower shall be for dens forever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is esteemed as a forest.
Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall remain in the fruitful field.
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the service of righteousness shall be quietness and assurance forever.
And my people shall dwell in a peaceful habitation, and in secure dwellings and in quiet resting places,
though it hails upon the forest, and the city is laid low.
Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send free the feet of the ox and the ass.
Woe to the destroyer, and you have not been destroyed; and the betrayer, and they have not betrayed you. When you stop destroying, you shall be destroyed. When you stop betraying, they shall betray you.
O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You. Be their arm every morning; our salvation also in the time of trouble.
At the sound of the tumult the people have fled; at the lifting up of Yourself the nations have been scattered.
And your spoils shall be gathered as the locust gathers; as the running to and fro of locusts he shall run upon them.
Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
Wisdom and knowledge shall be the steadfastness of your times, and the strength of salvation; the fear of Jehovah is His treasure.
Behold, their mighty ones shall cry outside; the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.
The highways lie waste, the traveler ceases. He has broken the covenant. He has despised the cities. He has had regard for no man.
The earth mourns and has grown feeble. Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like a wilderness; Bashan and Carmel are shaken out like empty fruit trees.
Now I will arise, says Jehovah; now I will be exalted; now I will lift up Myself.
You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble; your breath, like fire, shall devour you.
And the people shall be like the burnings of lime; like thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.
You who are far off, hear what I have done; and you who are near, perceive and know My might.
The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling has taken hold of the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?
He who walks righteously and speaks with equity; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands free from holding bribes, who stops his ear from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;
he shall dwell on high; his refuge shall be the strongholds of rocks; bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.
Your heart shall muse on terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the one who weighs? Where is the one who counts the towers?
You shall not see a fierce people, a people of unintelligible speech that you cannot perceive; of a stammering tongue that you cannot understand.
Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed meetings; your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet home, a tent that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, nor shall any of its cords be broken.
But there the glorious Jehovah will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars shall go, nor shall majestic ships pass by.
For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah is our Lawgiver, Jehovah is our King; He will save us.
Your ropes are loosened, they could not hold the base of the mast, they could not spread the sail. Then the prey of a great plunder is divided; the lame take the spoils.
And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the iniquity of the people who dwell there shall be taken away.
Come near, you nations, to hear; and you people, pay attention; let the earth hear, and its fullness; the world, and all its offspring.
For the wrath of Jehovah is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their armies. He has utterly destroyed them, He has delivered them to the slaughter.
Also their slain shall be thrown out, and their stench shall come up out of their corpses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled up like a scroll; and all their host shall wither, as a leaf withers off the vine, and as fruit falling from the fig tree.
For My sword is drenched in the heavens. Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My curse, for judgment.
The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
And the oryx shall come down with them, and the young bulls with the mighty; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
For it is the day of Jehovah’s vengeance, the year of retribution for the strife against Zion.
And its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land shall become burning pitch.
It shall not be quenched night or day; its smoke shall ascend forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it forever and forever.
But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it. And He shall stretch out over it the line of chaos, and the stones of emptiness.
They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but no one shall be there, and all its rulers shall be nothing.
And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in its fortresses; and it shall be a habitation of dragons and a dwelling for young owls.
The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the howling beasts; and the shaggy goat shall cry to his fellow. The night creature also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.
There the great owl shall make her nest, and lay and hatch, and gather them under her shadow; there shall the birds of prey also be gathered, every one with her mate.
Search from the book of Jehovah, and read; not one of these shall fail, not one shall lack her mate; for My mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.
And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it unto them by measuring line; they shall possess it perpetually, from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
The wilderness and the desert shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.
It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice, even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah and the majesty of our God.
Make the weak hands strong, and make the feeble knees secure.
Say to those of anxious heart, Be strong, fear not! Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God. He will come and save you.
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing. For in the wilderness waters shall break out, and streams in the desert.
And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land shall become springs of water, in the habitation of dragons where they dwell, a place for grass with reeds and rushes.
And a highway shall be there, even a road; and it shall be called, The Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it. Whoever travels on it, though a fool, shall not go astray.
No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up on it; they shall not be found there. But only the redeemed shall walk there.
And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.
And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah, with a great army. And he stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came out to him.
And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?
You say (but they are only words of the lips), I have counsel and strength for war. Now, in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?
Lo, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; on which, if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
But if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall bow down before this altar?
Now then, please exchange pledges with my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are even able on your part to put riders on them.
How then will you repel the face of one commander of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
Have I now come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.
Then Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. But do not speak to us in the Jewish language in the ears of the people who are on the wall.
But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?
Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you!
Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will deliver, to rescue us; this city shall not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria!
Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, Make a peace treaty with me, and come out to me; and let everyone eat of his vine, and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern,
until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and fresh wine, a land of bread and vineyards!
Let not Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
But they kept silent and did not answer him a word, for the king’s command said, Do not answer him.
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
And it happened when King Hezekiah heard it that he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah.
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy! For the children have come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall you say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia saying, He has come out to wage war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them. And shall you be delivered?
Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messenger, and read it. And Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah and spread it before Jehovah.
And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,
O Jehovah of Hosts, God of Israel, Who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made the heavens and the earth.
Extend Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to taunt the Living God.
Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,
and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
Now therefore, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are Jehovah, You alone.
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
this is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him: The virgin, the daughter of Zion, has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you.
Whom have you mocked and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.
By your servants you have taunted Jehovah and have said, By my many chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains beside Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees; and I will go to the extremities of its height, the forest of its Carmel.
I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.
Have you not heard from distant lands how I have done it? Even from ancient times I have formed it. Now I have brought it to pass, that your fortified cities should be caused to crash into heaps of ruins.
And their inhabitants had little power; being dismayed and ashamed. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and the standing grain before the field.
But I know where you dwell, and your going out, and your coming in, and your rage against Me.
Because your raging against Me, and your arrogance has come up into My ears, therefore I will put My hook in your nose, and My bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way from which you came.
And this shall be a sign to you: You shall eat grain this year from what was sown by itself; and the second year that which springs from the same; and in the third year you shall sow, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
And the remnant that escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward;
for out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and those who escape out of Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of Hosts shall do this.
Therefore thus says Jehovah to the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.
By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and shall not come into this city, says Jehovah.
For I will defend this city to save it, for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.
Then the angel of Jehovah went out and struck a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Assyria. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and remained in Nineveh.
And it came to pass as he was bowing down in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword. And they escaped into the land of Ararat; and Esar-Haddon his son reigned in his place.
In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to Jehovah,
and said, Remember now, O Jehovah, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done what is good in Your eyes. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.
Then came the Word of Jehovah to Isaiah, saying,
Go and say to Hezekiah: Thus says Jehovah the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add to your days fifteen years.
And I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
And this shall be a sign to you from Jehovah that Jehovah will do this thing that He has spoken:
behold, I will bring back the shadow which has gone down the steps on the sundial of Ahaz, ten steps backward. So the sun returned ten steps, by which it had gone down.
This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:
I said at the end of of my days, I shall go to the gates of Sheol; I am deprived of the rest of my years.
I said, I shall not see YAH, Jehovah, in the land of the living; I shall look on man no more among the inhabitants of the world.
My generation is plucked up and removed from me like a shepherd’s tent; I have cut off my life like a weaver; He will cut me off from the loom; from day even to night You make an end of me.
I have been still until morning; as a lion, so He breaks all my bones; from day even until night You make an end of me.
Like a twittering swallow, so I chatter; I mourn as a dove; my eyes look weakly to the heights. O Jehovah, I am distressed; be surety for me.
What shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has acted; I shall go slowly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
O Jehovah, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit; so You will restore me to health and make me live.
Behold, instead of peace I was bitter with bitterness; but You have delighted in delivering my soul from the pit of corruption. You have cast all my sins behind Your back.
For Sheol cannot thank You, death cannot praise You; those who go down into the pit cannot hope for Your truth.
The living, the living man, he shall praise You, as I do this day; the father shall make Your truth known to the children.
Jehovah is there to save me; therefore we will sing my songs with the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Jehovah.
For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs and rub it on the boil, and he shall live.
Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?
At that time Merodach-Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
And Hezekiah was glad because of them, and showed them the house of his treasures; the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all his armory, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What did these men say? And where did they come from to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a distant land, from Babylon.
Then he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house they have seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the Word of Jehovah of Hosts:
Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says Jehovah.
And some of your sons which shall come forth from you, which you shall beget, shall be taken away; and they shall be officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The Word of Jehovah which you have spoken is good. For he said, At least there shall be peace and truth in my days.
Comfort, O comfort My people, says your God.
Speak to the heart of Jerusalem, and cry out to her, that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received from the hand of Jehovah double for all her sins.
The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Prepare the way of Jehovah, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked places shall be made level, and the rough places a plain;
and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.
The voice said, Cry out! And he said, What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, and all the goodness of it is as the flower of the field.
The grass withers, the flower fades, because the Spirit of Jehovah blows upon it; surely the people are grass.
The grass withers, the flower fades; but the Word of our God stands forever.
You, who brings good tidings to Zion, go up onto the high mountain. Lift up your voice with strength, you who brings good tidings to Jerusalem, lift it up, be not afraid. Say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with a strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.
He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those who are with young.
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured out the heavens with a span? And who has calculated the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?
Who has directed the Spirit of Jehovah, and what man, as a counselor, has taught Him?
With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him and taught Him in the path of justice; and taught Him knowledge, and made known the way of understanding to Him?
Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are counted as the fine dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands as a very little thing.
And Lebanon is not enough to burn, nor the beasts of it enough for a burnt offering.
All the nations before Him are as nothing; and to Him they are accounted as less than nothing, and vanity.
To whom then will you compare the Mighty God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him?
The workman casts a graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold, and smelts silver chains.
Whoever is too poor for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he looks for a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that will not totter.
Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
It is He who sits upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
Who brings the rulers to nothing; He makes the judges of the earth as nothing.
Indeed, they shall not be planted; indeed, they shall not be sown. Indeed, their stump shall not take root in the earth. And He shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the tempest shall take them away like stubble.
To whom then will you compare Me, or with whom am I equal? says the Holy One.
Lift up your eyes on high, and consider who has created these things, who brings out their host by number. He calls them all by name by the greatness of His might, for He is strong in power; not one is missing.
Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hidden from Jehovah and my judgment is passed over by God?
Have you not known? Have you not heard, that the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not grow faint nor weary? His understanding is unsearchable.
He gives power to the faint; and to him with no strength, He increases might.
Even the young shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall be feeble and stumble;
but those who wait upon Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.
Keep silence before Me, O coastlands; and let the people renew their strength; let them come near. Then let them speak, Let us come near together for judgment.
Who raised up the righteous one from the east, called him to His foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? Who gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow?
Who pursued them and passed by in peace by the way he had not gone before by foot?
Who has planned and done it, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, am the First and the Last. I am He.
The coastlands saw and feared. The ends of the earth were afraid, and drew near and came.
They each one helped his neighbor, and said to his brother, Be strong.
So the craftsman encourages the refiner, and he who smooths with the hammer, him who struck the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good. And he makes it steady with nails so that it will not be shaken.
But you, Israel, are My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, My friend;
whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you and set you apart. And I said to you, You are My servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.
Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will make you strong; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of My righteousness.
Behold, all those who were enraged against you shall be ashamed and disgraced; they shall be as nothing. And those who strive with you shall perish.
You shall seek them, and shall not find them; the men striving against you shall be as nothing; at an end.
For I, Jehovah your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.
Fear not, you worm of Jacob and men of Israel; I will help you, says Jehovah and your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them fine, and shall make the hills like chaff.
You shall winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them. And you shall rejoice in Jehovah and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.
The poor and needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue fails for thirst. I Jehovah will hear them, I the God of Israel will not abandon them.
I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.
I will plant the cedar in the wilderness, the acacia tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree. I will set the fir tree in the desert, and the pine, and the box tree together;
that they may see and know, and determine and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.
Present your case, says Jehovah; approach to argue your defense, says the King of Jacob.
Let them approach, and confess to us what shall happen; let them disclose the former things, what they are, that we may determine a finding and know the final outcome; or proclaim to us things to come.
Make known the things to come after this, so that we may know that you are gods. Yes, do good, or do evil, so that we may anxiously watch it together.
Behold, you are nothing, and your work is nothing. He who chooses you is an abomination.
I have raised up one from the north and he shall come; from the sunrise he shall call upon My name. And he shall come against rulers as in a mortar, and as the potter tramples clay.
Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? And formerly, that we may say, He is righteous? Yea, no one declares; yea, no one proclaims; yea, no one hears your words.
First I shall say to Zion, Behold! Behold them! And I will give to Jerusalem one who brings good news.
For I looked, and there was no man; and of those there was no counselor, that I might ask and they could answer a word.
Behold, they are all wicked; their works are nothing; their molten images are like thin air and vanity.
Behold My Servant, whom I uphold; My Elect, in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth justice to the nations.
He shall not cry out, nor lift up, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street.
A bruised reed He shall not break, and a smoking wick He shall not quench; He shall bring forth justice unto truth.
He shall not fail nor be discouraged, until He has established justice on the earth; and the islands shall wait for His Law.
Thus says Jehovah the Mighty God, He who created the heavens and stretched them out, spreading out the earth and its offspring; Who gives breath to the people on it and spirit to those who walk on it.
I, Jehovah, have called You in righteousness, and will hold Your hand, and will keep You, and give You as a covenant to the people, as a Light to the nations;
to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, those who sit in darkness out of the prison house.
I am Jehovah; that is My name; and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images.
Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they spring forth, I proclaim them to you.
Sing to Jehovah a new song; His praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it; the coastlands and its inhabitants.
Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice, the villages where Kedar dwells. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the mountain tops.
Give glory to Jehovah and declare His praise in the coastlands.
Jehovah goes forth as a mighty man, He stirs up zeal like a man of war; He shouts, yea, roars; He shows Himself mighty against His enemies.
I have continually kept silent; I have been still and refrained Myself. Now I will cry like a woman in labor; I will pant and gasp at once.
I will make waste the mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation. And I will make the rivers coastlands, and I will dry up the pools.
And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths they have not known; I will make darkness into light before them, and crooked places straight. I will do these things for them, and not forsake them.
They have been turned back, they are greatly ashamed, those who trust in graven images and who say to the molten images, You are our gods.
Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.
Who is blind but My servant? Or deaf, as My messenger whom I sent? Who is blind as he who is perfect, and blind as Jehovah’s servant?
You see many things, but do not observe; opening the ears, but no one hears.
Jehovah is well pleased for His righteousness’ sake; He will magnify the Law and make it honorable.
But this is a people robbed and plundered; all of them are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prison houses. They are as prey, and no one delivers them; spoils, and no one says, Give it back!
Who among you will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
Who gave Jacob for a spoils, and Israel to robbers? Was it not Jehovah, against whom we have sinned? For they would not walk in His ways, nor did they obey His Law.
Therefore He has poured upon him the fury of His anger, and the strength of battle. And it has set him on fire all around, yet he did not know; and it burned him, yet he did not lay it to heart.
But now thus says Jehovah who created you, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel; Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine.
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; nor shall the flame consume you.
For I am Jehovah your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.
Since you were precious in My eyes, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.
Fear not, for I am with you. I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west.
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not keep back; bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth;
everyone who is called by My name; for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf who have ears.
Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled. Who among them can declare this and cause us to hear former things? Let them bring out their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is true.
You are My witnesses, says Jehovah, and My servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. Before Me no god was formed, nor shall there be after Me.
I, even I, am Jehovah; and there is no one to save besides Me.
I have declared and have saved, and I have shown, when there was no strange god among you; therefore you are My witnesses, says Jehovah, that I am the Mighty God.
Yea, before the day was, I am He; and no one can deliver out of My hand; I work, and who will reverse it?
Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought them all down as fugitives, and the Chaldeans, who shout in their ships.
I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
Thus says Jehovah, Who makes a way in the sea and a path through the mighty waters;
Who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the power: They shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinguished, they are quenched like a wick.
Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.
Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
The beasts of the field shall honor Me, the dragons and the young owls; because I give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My elect.
This people that I have formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise.
But you have not called upon Me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of Me, O Israel.
You have not brought Me the lamb of your burnt offerings; nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.
You have bought Me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled Me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened Me with your sins; you have wearied Me with your iniquities.
I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake, and will not remember your sins.
Bring to My remembrance; let us enter into judgment together; declare yourself, that you may be justified.
Your first father has sinned, and has mocked and rebelled against Me.
Therefore I will defile the rulers of the sanctuary, and will give Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant, and Israel whom I have chosen;
Thus says Jehovah who made you, and formed you from the womb, who will help you; Fear not, O Jacob My servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground. I will pour My spirit upon your seed, and My blessing upon your offspring;
and they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the watercourses.
One shall say, I am Jehovah’s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, For Jehovah, and be named by the name of Israel.
Thus says Jehovah, the King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and besides Me there is no God.
And who shall proclaim as I do, and shall declare it and set it in order for Me; since I founded the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and shall come; let them declare it to them.
Fear not, nor be afraid; have I not told you and declared it since then? Thus, you are My witnesses. Is there a God besides Me? Yea, there is no other rock. I have not known any.
Those who make a graven image, all of them are vanity; and the things which they desire shall not help. And they are their own witnesses; they do not see nor know; that they may be ashamed.
Who has formed a god or smelted a graven image that benefits nothing?
Behold, all his companions shall be ashamed; and the craftsmen, they are men. Let them be gathered together; let them stand up; they shall be in dread; they shall be ashamed together.
The craftsman in iron makes it in the coals with the tongs, and fashions it with hammers, and makes it with the strength of his arms. Then, he is hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water, and is faint.
The craftsman in wood stretches a measuring line; he makes an outline with a marker; he works it with carving tools, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it like the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the house.
He cuts down cedars, and takes cypress and oak, which he secures for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a fir tree, and the rain makes it grow.
Then it shall be for a man to burn; for he will take some of it and warm himself. Yes, he kindles it and bakes bread; he also makes a god and bows down to it; he makes it into a graven image and prostrates himself to it.
He burns part of it in the fire; with part of it he eats flesh; he roasts a roast and is satisfied; indeed, he warms himself, and says, Ah! I am warm, I have seen the fire.
And the rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image. He prostrates himself before it and bows down, and prays to it, and says, Deliver me! for you are my mighty god.
They have not known nor understood; for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see; and their hearts so that they cannot understand.
And no one considers within his heart, nor is there perception nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; indeed, also I have baked bread on its coals; I have roasted flesh and eaten; and shall I make the rest of it into an abomination? Shall I prostrate myself to a piece of wood?
He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has turned him aside, so that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is this not a lie in my right hand?
Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are My servant; I have formed you; you are My servant; O Israel, you shall not be forgotten by Me.
I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and as a cloud, your sins; return to Me, for I have redeemed you.
Sing, O heavens; for Jehovah has done it! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree in it! For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and glorified Himself in Israel!
Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, and He who formed you from the womb: I am Jehovah, who makes all things, who stretches out the heavens alone, who spreads out the earth by Myself;
who brings to nothing the signs of the liars, and makes diviners mad; who turns the wise backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;
who establishes the word of His servant, and performs the counsel of His messengers; who says to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up its waste places;
who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers;
who says of Cyrus, He is My shepherd, and shall do all My pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.
Thus says Jehovah to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have strengthened in order to subdue nations before him. And I will loosen the loins of kings, to open before him the gates; and the gates shall not be shut.
I will go before you, and make the high places level and straight. I will break in pieces the gates of bronze, and cut the iron bars in two.
And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, Jehovah, who calls you by your name, am the God of Israel.
For Jacob My servant’s sake, and Israel My elect, I have even proclaimed your name; I have entitled you, though you have not known Me.
I am Jehovah, and there is none other, no God besides Me; I embraced you, though you have not known Me;
that they may know from the rising of the sun, to its setting, that there is none besides Me. I am Jehovah, and there is no other;
forming the light and creating darkness; making peace and creating evil. I, Jehovah, do all these things.
Rain down from above, O heavens, and let the clouds pour down righteousness. Let the earth open, and let salvation bear fruit; and let righteousness spring up together. I, Jehovah, have created it.
Woe to him who strives with the One who formed him, a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to the one who forms it, What are you making? Or your work, He has no hands?
Woe to him who says to his father, What are you begetting? Or to the woman, What are you writhing over?
Thus says Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and the One who formed him, Do you ask Me of things to come? Do you give command to Me about My sons, and about the work of My hands?
I have made the earth, and created man on it; I, with My hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I ordained.
I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways; he shall build My city, and he shall set free My captives, not for price nor reward, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Thus says Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and merchandise of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come to you, and they shall be yours. They shall follow behind you; and they shall pass over in chains and they shall bow down to you. They shall plead with you, saying, Surely the Mighty God is in you; there is no one else, no other God.
Truly You are a Mighty God who hides Yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.
They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they who are makers of idols shall go into disgrace together.
But Israel shall be saved in Jehovah with an everlasting salvation. You shall not be ashamed nor humiliated to everlasting eternity.
For thus says Jehovah who Created the heavens, God who has formed the earth and made it; who has established it, who has not created it void, but has formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah, and there is no other.
I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth. I did not say to the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain. I, Jehovah, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations. Those who set up the wood of their graven image, and those that pray to a god that cannot save, they know nothing.
Declare and approach; yea, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from antiquity? Who has told it since then? Is it not I, Jehovah. And there is no other God besides Me; a just Mighty God and a Savior; there is no one besides Me.
Turn to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am the Mighty God, and there is no other.
I have sworn by Myself, the word has gone out of My mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that to Me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
One shall say, Only in Jehovah do I have righteousness and strength; to Him men shall come. And they shall be ashamed, all who are angry with Him.
In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols were on the beasts and on the cattle; the things you carried have become a load, a burden to the weary.
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but they themselves have gone into captivity.
Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, who were carried by Me from the belly, who were sustained from the womb;
even to your old age, I am He; and to the gray hairs I will bear you. I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
To whom will you compare Me, and make Me equal; and compare Me, that we may be alike?
They pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver out on the measuring rod, and hire a goldsmith; and he makes it into a god; they prostrate themselves, yea, they bow down.
They carry it on the shoulder, they carry it and set it in its place, and it stands; it shall not move from its place. Yes, one shall cry unto it, yet it cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
Remember this, and be a man; refresh the memory of your heart, you who rebel.
Remember the former things from a long time ago; for I am the Mighty God, and there is no other; I am God, and no one else is like Me,
declaring the end from the beginning, and from antiquity things which are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all My pleasure;
calling a bird of prey from the east, the man who executes my counsel from a distant land. Indeed, I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass. I have formed it; I will also do it.
Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from righteousness;
I bring near My righteousness. It shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not delay. And I will place salvation in Zion, My glory for Israel.
Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground. There is no throne for you, O daughter of the Chaldeans. For you shall no more be called tender and delicate.
Take the millstones and grind meal. Uncover your veil, strip off the skirt, bare the thigh, pass through the rivers.
Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance and I will not meet you as a man.
Our Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts is His name, the Holy One of Israel.
Sit in silence, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the Queen of Kingdoms.
I was angry with My people, I have polluted My inheritance, and given them into your hand. You have shown them no mercy; upon the aged you have laid your yoke very heavily.
And you said, I shall be a queen forever; so you did not lay these things to heart, nor remember the latter end of it.
Now therefore hear this, O voluptuous one, who lives securely; who says in her heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, nor shall I know the loss of children.
But these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day: The loss of children, and widowhood. They shall come upon you in their fullness for the multitude of your sorceries, and for the great power of your enchantments.
For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me. Your wisdom and your knowledge have perverted you; and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no one else besides me.
Therefore evil shall come upon you, and you shall not know its origin. And disaster shall fall upon you, and you shall not be able to cover it over. And desolation shall come upon you suddenly, which you shall not be informed of.
Stand now with your charms, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored since your youth. Perhaps you will be able to profit; perhaps you may prevail.
You are wearied by your many counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers and the fortunetellers step forth and save you from what shall come upon you.
Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; it shall not be a coal to be warmed with; nor a fire in front of which to sit.
Thus shall they be to you with whom you have labored, your merchants from your youth. They shall wander, each one, to his own region; no one shall save you.
Hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of Jehovah and make mention of the God of Israel (but not in truth nor in righteousness;
for they name themselves as being of the holy city, and rest themselves on the God of Israel; Jehovah of Hosts is His name):
I have declared the former things from the beginning, and they proceeded forth out of My mouth, and I proclaimed to them. I acted suddenly, and they came to pass,
because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your brow bronze.
I even declared it to you from the beginning. Before it happened I proclaimed it to you, lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image and my molten image has commanded them.
You have heard; see all this. And will you not declare it? I have shown you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.
They are created now, and not since the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.
Surely you did not hear, surely you did not know; surely from long ago your ear was not opened. For I knew that you would deceive with treachery, and were called a transgressor from the womb.
For My name’s sake I will prolong My anger, and for My praise I will restrain for you, so that I do not cut you off.
Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.
For my own sake, for My own sake I will do it; for why should My name be defiled? And I will not give My glory to another.
Listen to me O Jacob, and Israel My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last.
My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has stretched out the heavens. When I called to them, they stood up together.
Let all of you gather and hear. Who among them has declared these things? Jehovah has loved him; He will do as He pleases upon Babylon, and His arm shall be upon the Chaldeans.
I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him and made his way prosperous.
Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning. From the time it existed, I was there; and now the Lord Jehovah, and His Spirit, has sent Me.
Thus says Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Jehovah your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.
Oh that you had paid attention to My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
Your seed also would have been like the sand, and the offspring of your womb like grains of sand; his name would not have been cut off nor destroyed from before My face.
Go out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! Declare it with a resounding voice! Proclaim this; let it go forth to the ends of the earth! Say, Jehovah has redeemed His servant, Jacob!
And they did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; He split open the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
There is no peace, says Jehovah, unto the wicked.
Listen to Me, O coastlands; and give attention, you people from afar; Jehovah has called Me from the womb; from My mother’s belly He has made mention of My name.
And He has made My mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of His hand He has hidden Me, and made Me a polished shaft. He has hidden Me in His quiver,
and said to Me, You are My servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.
Then I said, I have labored in vain; I have spent My strength for nothing, and in vain; yet surely My just due is with Jehovah, and My work with My God.
And now, says Jehovah who formed Me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him: Though Israel is not gathered, yet I shall be glorious in the eyes of Jehovah, and My God shall be My strength.
And He said, It is but a little thing that You should be My servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to bring back the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You for a light to the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the earth.
Thus says Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to Him whom man despises, to Him whom the nation loathes, the Servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, rulers also shall bow down, because of Jehovah who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and He shall choose You.
Thus says Jehovah: In a favorable time I have answered You, and in a day of salvation I have helped You; and I will preserve You, and give You as a covenant to the people, to establish the earth, to cause them to inherit the desolate possessions;
that You may say to the prisoners, Go out! To those who are in darkness, Show yourselves! They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be on all the barren heights.
They shall not hunger nor thirst; nor shall the heat nor sun strike them; for He who has mercy on them will lead them; even by the springs of water He will guide them.
And I will make all My mountains a way, and My highways shall be elevated.
Behold, these shall come from afar; and, lo, those from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
Sing, O heavens! Be joyful, O earth! And break out into singing, O mountains! For the Lord has comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted.
But Zion said, Jehovah has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.
Can a woman forget her nursing infant, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Indeed, they may forget; yet I will not forget you.
Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands; your walls are perpetually before Me.
Your children shall make haste; those destroying you and laying waste to you shall go out from you.
Lift up your eyes all around and see; they all gather and come to you. As I live, says Jehovah, you shall surely wear them as an ornament, and bind them on you as a bride does.
For your waste and desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too constricted to dwell there, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away.
The sons of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too narrow for me; let a place come to me so that I may have room to dwell.
Then you shall say in your heart, Who has begotten these for me, since I am bereaved, and desolate, removed into exile. And who has raised up these? Behold, I was left alone. But these, where were they?
Thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, and set up My banner to the people; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.
And kings shall be your foster fathers, and their queens your wet nurses. They shall bow down to you, with faces to the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet. And you shall know that I am Jehovah; for they who wait for Me shall not be ashamed.
Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
But thus says Jehovah, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the ruthless shall escape. For I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.
And I will feed those who oppress you, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Thus says Jehovah, Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce, whom I have put away? Or to which of My creditors have I sold you? Behold, you have been sold for your iniquities, and your mother has been put away for your sins.
Why, when I came, was no one here? I called and no one answered. Is My hand shortened at all so that it cannot redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at My rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, because there is no water, and die of thirst.
I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
The Lord Jehovah has given Me the tongue of the learned, to know how to speak a word in season to the weary. He wakens morning by morning, He wakens the ear to hear as the learned.
The Lord Jehovah has opened My ear, and I was not rebellious, nor turned away backwards.
I gave My back to those who strike, and My cheeks to those who pluck; I hid not My face from shame and spitting.
For the Lord Jehovah will help Me; therefore I have not been ashamed. Therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
He is near who justifies Me; who will contend with Me? Let us stand together; who is the master of My judgment? Let him come near Me.
Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help Me; who is he who shall condemn Me? Lo, they all shall wear out like a garment; the moth shall eat them.
Who among you fears Jehovah? Who obeys the voice of His Servant? Who walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and rest on his God.
Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who are surrounded with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks which you have kindled. This you shall have from My hand; you shall lie down in sorrow.
Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, who seek Jehovah: Look to the rock from which you have been hewn, and to the hole of the pit from which you have been dug.
Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who bore you; for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.
For Jehovah will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her waste places; and He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
Listen to Me, My people; and give ear to Me, O My nation; for a law shall go out from Me, and I will make My justice to rest for a light of the people.
My righteousness is near; My salvation has gone forth, and My arms shall judge the people; the coastlands shall wait upon Me, and on My arm they shall trust.
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall become old like a garment; and its inhabitants shall die in the same way. But My salvation shall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be broken.
Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose heart is My Law; do not fear the reproach of men, nor be afraid of their revilings.
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool; but My righteousness shall be forever, and My salvation from generation to generation.
Awake! awake! Put on strength, O arm of Jehovah. Awake, as in the days of antiquity, in the generations of old. Was it not You who cut Rahab into pieces, wounding the dragon?
Was it not You who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?
Therefore the redeemed of Jehovah shall return and come with singing into Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head. Gladness and joy shall overtake them; sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you, that you should fear a man, who shall die; or the son of man, who shall be made as grass?
And you forget Jehovah your Maker, who has stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth. And you dread continually, every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy. And where is the fury of the oppressor?
Stooped over he hurries to be loosed, so that he should not die in the pit, nor lack his bread.
But I am Jehovah your God, who divided the sea, whose waves roared; Jehovah of Hosts is His name.
And I have put My Words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of My hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are My people.
Awake! Awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, who has drunk the cup of His fury from the hand of Jehovah; you have drunk the dregs of the cup of staggering, and wrung them out.
There is no one to guide her among all the sons she has borne; and no one takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has raised.
These two things have come upon you, who shall be sorry for you? Desolation, and destruction, and famine, and the sword. By whom shall I comfort you?
Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets like a wild animal in a net, filled with the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of your God.
Therefore now hear this, you afflicted one, and drunk, but not with wine.
Thus says your Lord, Jehovah, and your God who pleads the case of His people: Behold, I have taken the cup of staggering out of your hand, even the dregs of the cup of My fury; you shall never drink it again.
But I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you, who have said to your soul, Bow down so that we may pass over; and lay your back on the ground, even as the street, for those who cross over.
Awake! Awake! Put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the Holy City. For never again shall the uncircumcised and unclean come into you.
Shake yourself from the dust; rise up! Sit down, Jerusalem! Loose yourself from your neckbands, O captive daughter of Zion.
For thus says Jehovah, You have sold yourselves for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without silver.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah, My people went down before into Egypt to stay there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.
Now therefore, what have I here, says Jehovah, that My people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule make them howl, says Jehovah; and My name is continually blasphemed every day.
Therefore My people shall know My name. Thus it shall be in that day, for I am He who speaks; behold, it is I.
How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him bringing good tidings, proclaiming peace; bringing good news, proclaiming salvation; who says to Zion, Your God reigns!
Your watchmen shall lift up the voice! They shall lift up the voice together in a resounding cry; for they shall see eye to eye, when Jehovah brings Zion back.
Break forth together into a resounding cry of joy, you waste places of Jerusalem! For Jehovah has comforted His people; He has redeemed Jerusalem.
Jehovah has bared His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch not the unclean. Go out of her midst; purify yourselves, you who bear the vessels of Jehovah.
For you shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for Jehovah will go before you; and the God of Israel gathers you.
Behold, My Servant shall deal with insight; He shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
Just as many were astonished at You (His appearance was disfigured more than any man, and His form more than the sons of mankind);
so shall He sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths at Him; for that which had not been told to them, they shall see; and what they had not heard, they shall consider.
Who has believed Our report? And to whom has the arm of Jehovah been revealed?
For He grows up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of the dry ground. He has no form nor splendor that we should regard Him, nor anything spectacular that we should desire Him.
He is despised and rejected by men; a Man of pain, and knowing infirmity; a hiding of faces; being despised, we have esteemed Him not.
Truly He has borne our sicknesses, and carried our pain; yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted.
But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, each one to his own way; and Jehovah has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all.
He has been oppressed, and He was afflicted; yet He opens not His mouth. He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before its shearers is mute, so He opens not His mouth.
He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare His generation? For He was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of My people He was stricken.
And His grave was assigned with the wicked, and with the rich in His death; although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth.
Yet it pleased Jehovah to crush Him; to grieve Him; that He should give His soul as a sin-offering. He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the delight of Jehovah shall prosper in His hand.
He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be fulfilled. By His knowledge shall My righteous Servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities.
Therefore I will apportion to Him with the great, and He shall divide the spoils with the strong; because He has poured out His soul unto death; and He was reckoned among the transgressors; and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
Rejoice, O barren one, you who have not borne; break forth into screams of delight, you who have not writhed in pangs. For more are the children of the desolate than the children of the one who is married, says Jehovah.
Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare, lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes;
for you shall burst forth on the right hand and on the left. And your seed shall inherit the nations, and make the desolate cities inhabited.
Do not fear, for you shall not be ashamed; nor be humiliated, for you shall not be put to shame. For you shall forget the shame of your youth, and shall not remember the reproach of your widowhood any more.
For your Maker is your husband; Jehovah of Hosts is His name; and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. He shall be called, GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH.
For Jehovah has called you as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, like a wife of youth, when you were rejected, says your God.
For a brief moment I have left you; but with great mercies I will gather you.
In overflowing wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy upon you, says Jehovah your Redeemer.
For this is like the waters of Noah to Me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should never again overflow the earth, so I have sworn to not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.
For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but My kindness shall not depart from you, nor shall My covenant of peace be removed, says Jehovah, who has mercy on you.
O you afflicted one, storm-tossed and not comforted, behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems, and lay your foundations with sapphires.
And I will make your pinnacles of ruby, and your gates of sparkling stones, and all your borders of delightful stones.
And all your children shall be taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of your children.
In righteousness you shall be established; you shall be far from oppression; for you shall not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.
Indeed, they shall surely gather together, but not by Me; whoever shall gather against you, by you he shall fall.
Behold, I have created the smith who blows the coals in the fire, and who brings out a tool for his work; and I have created the one who ruins to destroy.
No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from Me, says Jehovah.
Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy and eat. Yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
Why do you weigh out money for what is not bread, and your labor for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
Extend your ear, and come to Me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
Behold, I have given him as a witness to the people, a leader and commander of people.
Behold, you shall call a nation that you do not know, and nations that did not know you shall run to you because of Jehovah your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for He has glorified you.
Seek Jehovah while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.
For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, says Jehovah.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.
For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
so shall My Word be, which goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall succeed in that for which I have sent it.
For you shall go out with joy, and be led out with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into praise, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
Instead of the thorn, the fir tree shall come up; and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree shall come up; and it shall be to Jehovah for a name, for a perpetual sign that shall not be cut off.
Thus says Jehovah, Keep justice and do righteousness; for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed.
Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who lays hold on it; who keeps from defiling the sabbath, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
And do not let the son of the foreigner, who has joined himself to Jehovah, speak, saying, Jehovah has utterly separated me from His people. And do not let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
For thus says Jehovah to the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, and choose what pleases Me, and hold fast to My covenant:
Even to them will I give within My house and within My walls a share and a name better than that of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off.
Also the children of the foreigner, who join themselves to Jehovah to serve Him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be His servants, everyone who keeps from defiling the Sabbath, and holds fast to My covenant:
Even them I will bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on My altar; for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah who gathers the outcasts of Israel, Yet I will gather to him others besides those who are gathered to him.
All you beasts of the field, come to devour, all you beasts in the forest.
His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant; they are all dumb dogs who cannot bark, dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.
Yea, they are greedy dogs which never have enough. And they are shepherds who cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his own gain, to his own end.
They say, Come, let us get wine and binge on strong drink; and tomorrow shall be like today; much more abundant.
The righteous perishes, and no one lays it to heart, and merciful men are taken away; no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the face of evil.
He shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, you seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
Of whom do you make sport? Against whom do you make a wide mouth and stick out the tongue? Are you not children of transgression, a seed of deception,
being inflamed with gods under every green tree, slaughtering the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?
Among the smooth stones of the stream is your portion; they, even they, are your lot; even to them you have poured a drink offering, you have offered a food offering. Should I be comforted over these?
On a lofty and high mountain you have set your bed; even there you went up to offer sacrifice.
Also behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorials; for you uncovered yourself and went up to those other than Me. You enlarged your bed and made a covenant with them; you have loved to experience their bed first hand.
And you went to the king with ointment, and increased your perfumes, and sent your messengers far away, and lowered yourself even to Sheol.
You are wearied in the length of your way; yet you did not say, There is no hope! You found life in your hand; therefore you were not weak.
And of whom have you been afraid or feared, that you have lied and have not remembered Me, nor laid it to your heart? Have I not been silent, even for a long time, and you did not fear Me?
I will declare your righteousness, and your works; for they shall not be of any benefit to you.
When you cry out, let your collection of idols deliver you; but the wind shall carry them all away; a breath shall take them. But he who puts his trust in Me shall possess the land, and shall inherit My holy mountain.
And He shall say, Raise up! Raise up! Clear a path! Remove the stumbling block out of the way of My people.
For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and consecrated place, even with the contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
For I will not contend forever, nor will I always be angry; for the spirit would grow faint before Me, and the souls I have made.
For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry and struck him; I hid Myself and was angry, and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
I have seen his ways, and will heal him. I will also lead him, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off, and to him who is near, says Jehovah; and I will heal him.
But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.
Cry aloud, do not spare; lift up your voice like a shofar, and declare to My people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.
Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and did not forsake the ordinance of their God. They ask of Me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in drawing near to God.
They say, Why have we fasted, and You do not see? Why have we afflicted our souls, and You take no notice? Behold, in the day of your fast you devise pleasures, and oppress all your laborers.
Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness; you shall not fast as you do today, to make your voice heard on high.
Is it such a fast that I have chosen? A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah?
Is not this the fast that I have chosen: To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
Is it not to break your bread to the hungry, and that you should bring home the wandering poor? When you see the naked to cover him; and not hide yourself from your own flesh?
Then shall your light break forth as the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Jehovah shall bring up the rear.
Then you shall call, and Jehovah will answer; you shall cry out, and He shall say, Here I am. If you take the yoke away from your midst, the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness;
and if you extend your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall your light shine in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday.
And Jehovah shall guide you continually and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones fat; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
And those from among you shall build the old ruins; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called, The Repairer of the Breach, The Restorer of Paths to Dwell in.
If you turn back your foot, on the Sabbath, from doing what you please on My holy days, and call the Sabbath a delight, the sacred of Jehovah, honorable; and shall honor Him, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words,
then you shall delight yourself in Jehovah; and I will cause you to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father. The mouth of Jehovah has spoken.
Behold, Jehovah’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor is His ear heavy, that it cannot hear.
But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, that He will not hear.
For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has uttered perverseness.
No one calls for justice, nor does anyone plead for truth; they trust in vanity and speak lies. They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity.
They hatch vipers’ eggs and weave the spider’s web; he who eats their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.
Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.
Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; devastation and destruction are in their paths.
The way of peace they have not known, and there is no justice in their paths. They have made crooked paths for themselves; whoever goes in them shall not know peace.
Therefore justice is far from us; nor does righteousness overtake us. We wait for daylight, but behold, the night; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes. We stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places like dead men.
We all roar like bears, and mourn with moaning like doves; we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.
For our transgressions are multiplied before You, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them;
in transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and backsliding from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
And justice is driven back, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.
Yea, truth fails; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased Him that there was no justice.
And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore His own arm brought salvation unto Him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him.
For He put on righteousness like a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head. And He put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was covered with zeal as a cloak.
According to their deeds, accordingly He will repay; fury to His adversaries, recompense to His enemies. He will completely repay their deeds to the coastlands.
So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah shall drive him out.
And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.
As for Me, this is My covenant with them, says Jehovah; My Spirit that is upon you, and My Words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed’s seed, says Jehovah, from now on and forever.
Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of Jehovah has risen upon you.
For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but Jehovah shall arise over you, and His glory shall be seen upon you.
And the nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawning.
Lift up your eyes all around, and see. All of them gather themselves; they come to you. Your sons shall come from afar, and your daughters shall be carried on the side.
Then you shall be in awe and become radiant, and your heart shall tremble and swell for joy; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come unto you.
A multitude of camels shall overwhelm you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah. All those from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah.
All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you; the rams of Nebajoth shall minister to you. They shall come up on My altar and be acceptable to Me, and I will glorify the house of My glory.
Who are these who fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
Surely the coastlands shall wait for Me, and the ships of Tarshish will come first, to bring your children from afar, their silver and their gold with them, to the name of Jehovah your God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because He has glorified you.
And the sons of foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall serve you; for in My wrath I struck you, but in My favor I have had mercy upon you.
Therefore your gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day or night, to bring to you the wealth of the nations, and that their kings may be led.
For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish. Yes, those nations will be wasted unto desolation.
The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; and I will make the place of My feet glorious.
Also the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bowing to you; and all those who despised you shall prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet. And they shall call you, The City of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Whereas you were forsaken and hated, so that no one passed through, I will make you a perpetual majesty, a joy of many generations.
You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and suckle the breast of kings; and you shall know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
Instead of bronze I will bring gold, and instead of iron I will bring silver; and instead of wood I will bring bronze, and instead of stones, iron. I will also make your officers peace, and your overseers righteousness.
Violence shall no more be heard in your land, neither devastation nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
The sun shall no more be your light by day; nor the brightness of the moon give light to you; but Jehovah will be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
Your sun shall not go down any more, nor shall your moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be your everlasting light, and the days of your mourning shall be ended.
Your people also shall all be righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of My planting, the work of My hands, so that I may be glorified.
A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.
The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me; because Jehovah has anointed Me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the mantle of praise for the spirit of heaviness; so that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that He might be glorified.
And they shall rebuild the old wastes, they shall raise up what was formerly desolated. And they shall repair the waste cities, what lay desolate for many generations.
And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
But you shall be named, The Priests of Jehovah; and they shall call you, Ministers of our God. You shall eat the riches of the nations, and you shall revel in their glory.
Instead of your shame you shall have double; and instead of reproach they shall rejoice in their portion. Therefore in their own land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be theirs.
For I, Jehovah, love justice; I hate stolen things for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the people; all who see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed Jehovah has blessed.
I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garment of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness like a bridegroom adorns himself with ornaments, and like a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden causes that which is sown to grow; so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
For Zion’s sake I will not be silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until its righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her salvation as a burning lamp.
And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah will name.
You also shall be a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
You shall no more be called Forsaken; nor shall your land any more be called Desolate; but you shall be called My Delight Is In Her, and your land, Married; for Jehovah delights in you, and your land is married.
For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so will your God rejoice over you.
I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who shall never be silent day or night; you who remember Jehovah, do not keep silent.
And give Him no rest until He establishes and makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
Jehovah has sworn by His right hand, and by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give your grain as food for your enemies; and the children of foreigners shall not drink your wine for which you have labored.
But those who gathered it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and those who brought it together shall drink it in My holy courts.
Pass! Pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Raise up! Raise up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a banner for the people.
Behold, Jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes. Behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.
And they shall call them, The Holy People, The Redeemed Of Jehovah; and you shall be called, Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.
Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, this One adorned in His apparel, flexing His great strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
Why is Your apparel red, and Your garments like one who treads in the winepress?
I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no one with Me; for I tread them in My anger and trample them in My fury, and their blood is sprinkled on My garments, and I have stained all My apparel.
For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come.
And I looked, and there was no one to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold; therefore My own arm has given victory for Me; and My fury sustained Me.
And I will tread down the people in My anger, and make them drunk in My fury, and I will bring down their blood to the earth.
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which He has bestowed upon them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His lovingkindnesses.
For He said, Surely they are My people, children that will not lie; so He was their Savior.
In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
But they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirit; therefore He changed, to be their enemy, and He fought against them.
Then He remembered the days of old, Moses and His people, saying, Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within him;
who led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make for Himself an everlasting name?
He led them through the deep, like a horse in the wilderness, so that they might not stumble.
As a beast goes down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah caused him to rest. So You led Your people, to make for Yourself a glorious name.
Look down from Heaven, and look down from the place of Your holiness and of Your glory. Where is Your zeal and Your strength, the multitude of Your tender affections and of Your mercies toward me? Are they restrained?
Indeed, You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does not acknowledge us. You, O Jehovah, are our Father, our Redeemer; Your name is from everlasting.
O Jehovah, why have You made us wander from Your ways, and hardened our heart from Your fear? For the sake of Your servants, return the tribes of Your inheritance.
The people of Your holiness have possessed it but a little while; our enemies have trampled Your sanctuary.
We are from antiquity; You never ruled over them; they were never called by Your name.
Oh that You would rend the heavens and come down! That the mountains would quake at Your presence,
as the brushwood fire burns, as the fire causes water to boil; to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence!
When You did awesome things which we did not look for, You came down, the mountains shook at Your presence.
For since ancient times they have not heard, nor been obedient. Eye has not seen any god besides You, who works for him who waits for Him.
You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways (Behold, You were angry, for we sinned continually), and we shall be saved.
But we are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like a menstruation cloth. And we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
And there is no one who calls upon Your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us, and have melted us away because of our iniquities.
But now, O Jehovah, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the One who forms us; and we all are the work of Your hand.
Do not be greatly furious, O Jehovah, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, please look. We all are Your people.
Your holy cities are a wilderness; Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem is a desolation.
Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised You, is burned up with fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
Will You restrain Yourself over these things, O Jehovah? Will You be silent and greatly afflict us?
I am sought by those who asked not for Me; I am found by those who did not seek Me. I had said, Look to Me, Look to Me; to a nation that was not calling upon My name.
I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
a people who continually provoke Me to anger to My face; who sacrifice in gardens, and burn incense on altars of bricks;
who remain among the graves, and spend the night in the tombs, who eat swine’s flesh, and the broth of unclean things in their vessels;
who say, Keep to yourself, do not come near me; for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in My nose, a fire that burns all the day.
Behold, it is written before Me; I will not be silent, but what I will repay; yea, I will repay into their bosom
your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed Me on the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.
Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Do not destroy it, for a blessing is in it; so I will do to My servants, that I may not destroy them all.
And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who inherits My mountains; and My elect shall inherit it, and My servants shall dwell there.
And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for My people who have sought Me.
But you are those who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who furnish the drink offering to Fate.
Therefore I have assigned you to the sword; and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer; when I spoke, you did not hear, but did evil before My eyes, and chose that in which I have not delighted.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My servants will eat, but you shall be hungry. Behold, My servants will drink, but you shall be thirsty. Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.
Behold, My servants will sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl because of a crushed spirit.
And you shall leave your name as a curse to My elect; for the Lord Jehovah will kill you, and call His servants by another name.
He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth. And he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from My eyes.
For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. And the former shall not be remembered, nor come to mind.
But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem as a rejoicing, and her people as a joy.
I have rejoiced in Jerusalem, and exulted in My people. And the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
There shall not be an infant of only a few days, nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days. For the child shall die at a hundred years old; but the sinner who is a hundred years old shall be accursed.
And they shall build houses and live in them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
They shall not build, and another live in them; they shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree are the days of My people, and My elect shall grow old enjoying the work of their hands.
They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth children for terror. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.
And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is My throne, and earth My footstool. Where, then, is the house that you would build for Me? And where is the place of My rest?
For all those My hand has made, and all those exist, says Jehovah. But to this one will I have regard: To the lowly and contrite of spirit, and the one who trembles at My Word.
He who kills an ox is as if he killed a man; he who sacrifices a lamb is as if he broke a dog’s neck; he who offers an offering is as if he offered swine’s blood; he who burns incense is as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.
I also will choose the things that delude them, and I will bring their fears upon them, because when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they have not obeyed. But they did evil before My eyes and have chosen that in which I have not delighted.
Hear the Word of Jehovah, you who tremble at His Word: Your brothers who hated you, who cast you out because of My name, said, Let Jehovah be glorified. But He will appear for your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
A roaring sound from the city, a sound from the temple, the sound of Jehovah repaying His enemies.
Before she writhed in labor, she gave birth; before her pangs came, she delivered a male child.
Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth give birth in one day? Or shall a nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion had gone into labor, she had brought forth her children.
Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth, says Jehovah? Shall I beget, and then restrain the womb? says your God.
Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her;
that you may suckle and be satisfied with her comforting breasts; that you may suck milk and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.
For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like a flowing stream. Then you shall suckle, you shall be carried on her sides and be dandled upon her knees.
As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
And you shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward His servants, and His indignation toward His enemies.
For behold, Jehovah will come with fire and with His chariots like a tempest, to refresh His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.
For by fire and by His sword Jehovah will judge all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.
Those who sanctify themselves, and purify themselves to go into the garden after an idol that is in its midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.
For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall come to pass that I will gather all the nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory.
And I will set a sign among them. And those among them who escape I will send to the nations; to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud (who draw the bow), to Tubal, and Javan; to the far away coasts that have not heard of My fame, nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the nations.
And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to Jehovah out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.
And I will also take some of them for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.
And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to bow down before Me, says Jehovah.
And they shall go out and observe the dead corpses of the men who have rebelled against Me. For their worm does not die, nor is their fire quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.
The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
to whom the Word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
It also came in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
Then, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I consecrated you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.
Then I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.
But Jehovah said to me, Do not say, I am a youth; for you shall go to all to whom I shall send you, and whatever I command you, you shall speak.
Do not be afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you, says Jehovah.
And Jehovah put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put My Words in your mouth.
Behold, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what do you see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
And Jehovah said to me, You have seen well; for I will keep watch over My Word to perform it.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, What do you see? And I said, I see a boiling pot; and its face is facing north.
And Jehovah said to me, Out of the north an evil will be unleashed upon all the inhabitants of the land.
For behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they shall come, and they shall each one set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.
And I will pronounce My judgments against them regarding all their evil, those who have forsaken Me, and burned incense to other gods, and bowed down to the works of their own hands.
You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed at their faces, lest I shame you before them.
For behold, I have made you a fortified city this day, and an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its rulers, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you. For I am with you, says Jehovah, to deliver you.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your betrothals, when you went after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.
Israel was holiness to Jehovah, and the firstfruits of His increase. All that devour him shall be held guilty; evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.
Hear the Word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
Thus says Jehovah, What injustice have your fathers found in Me, that they have gone far from Me and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?
Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of dry places, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man lived?
And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat its fruit and its goodness; but when you entered, you defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination.
The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And they who handle the Law did not know Me; the shepherds also rebelled against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.
Therefore I will contend with you, says Jehovah, and with your children’s children I will make a complaint.
For pass over the coasts of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider carefully, and see if there is such a thing.
Has a nation changed their gods, which are not gods? But My people have changed their Glory for that which does not profit.
Be appalled, O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid; be greatly desolated, says Jehovah.
For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of Living Waters, to hew out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
Is Israel a servant? Or is he a homeborn slave? Why is he plundered?
The young lions roared against him; they uttered their voice. And they made his land a waste; his cities are burned without inhabitant.
Also the children of Noph and Tahpanhes have fed on your crown.
Have you not brought this upon yourself, in that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, when He led you by the way?
And now what are you doing on the way toward Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? Or what are you doing, going toward Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?
Your own evil shall correct you, and your backslidings shall reprove you. Therefore know and see that it is an evil and bitter thing that you have forsaken Jehovah your God, and that My fear is not in you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.
For long ago you broke your yoke and tore apart your bonds; and you said, I will not transgress, when on every high hill and under every green tree you lay down like a harlot.
Yet I planted you a noble vine, a true seed. How then have you turned into the degenerate shoots of an alien vine to Me?
For though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap, yet your iniquity is stained before Me, says the Lord Jehovah.
How can you say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baals? See your way in the valley, know what you have done! You are a swift camel crisscrossing its ways.
A wild ass used to the wilderness, in her cravings she sniffs at the wind; when she is in heat who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.
Withhold your foot from being bare, and your throat from thirst. But you said, There is no hope. No! For I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.
As the thief is ashamed when he is found out, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets;
saying to a tree, You are my father; and to a stone, You gave birth to me. For they have turned their back to Me, and not their face; but in the time of their distress they will say, Arise and save us!
But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your distress; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.
Why will you plead with Me? You all have rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.
In vain I have chastened your children; they received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
O generation, see the Word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of darkness? Why do My people say, We roam freely; we will come no more to You?
Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet My people have forgotten Me days without number.
Why do you beautify your way to seek love? Therefore you have also taught the evil women your ways.
Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I did not find them by secret search, but plainly on all these.
Yet you say, Because I am innocent, surely His anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with you, because you say, I have not sinned.
Why do you gad about so much to change your way? You also shall be ashamed of Egypt, as you were ashamed of Assyria.
Indeed, you shall go out from this place, with your hands on your head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.
They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, shall he return to her again? Would not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; yet turn back to Me, says Jehovah.
Lift up your eyes to the desolate heights, and see. Where have you not been lain with and ravished? By the highways you have sat for them, like an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your harlotry and with your evil.
Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a harlot’s forehead; you refused to be ashamed.
Will you not now cry to Me, My father, You are the guide of my youth?
Will He keep His anger forever? Will He keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done all the evil things you could.
Jehovah also said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has committed adultery there.
And after she had done all these things I said, Turn back to Me! But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
And I saw, when for all the causes for which backsliding Israel committed adultery, I put her away and gave her a certificate of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she also went and committed adultery.
So it came to pass through the wantonness of her harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and pieces of wood.
And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to Me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says Jehovah.
And Jehovah said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself to be more righteous than treacherous Judah.
Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, O backsliding Israel, says Jehovah; and I will not cause My anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, says Jehovah, and I will not keep anger forever.
Only, acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Jehovah your God and have scattered your ways to strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed My voice, says Jehovah.
Return, O backsliding children, says Jehovah; for I am married to you. And I will take you, one from a city, and two from a family; and I will bring you to Zion.
And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
And it shall come to pass, when you have multiplied and increased in the land in those days, says Jehovah, that they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah! Nor shall it come to mind; nor shall they remember it; nor shall they seek it; nor shall it be made anymore.
At that time Jerusalem shall be called, The Throne of Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. Nor shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil hearts.
In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.
But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a beautiful inheritance among the multitudes of nations! And I said, You shall call Me, My Father, and shall not turn away from Me.
Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her companion, so you have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.
A voice was heard on the desolate heights; weeping and supplications of the children of Israel; for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten Jehovah their God.
Return, O backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to You; for You are Jehovah our God.
Truly, deception comes from the high hills, from the multitudes on the mountains. Truly, in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.
For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
We lie down in our shame, and our reproach covers us; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.
If you will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, return to Me. And if you will put away your abominations out of My sight, then you shall not waver.
And you shall swear, Jehovah lives, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him they shall glory.
For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns.
Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest My fury come forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Declare in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; and say, Blow the shofar in the land; cry out, gather together, and say, Gather yourselves and let us go into the fortified cities.
Set up the standard toward Zion, take refuge, do not wait around; for I will bring evil from the north, and great destruction.
The lion has come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will fall into ruins without inhabitant.
Put on sackcloth for this, wail and howl; for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.
And it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the rulers; and the priests shall be appalled, and the prophets shall be stunned.
Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Surely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You shall have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the soul.
At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind from the desolate heights in the wilderness blows toward the daughter of My people, not to sift nor to cleanse.
A full wind from these places shall come unto Me. Now also I will pronounce judgment against them.
Behold, he shall come up like clouds, and his chariots like a tempest. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us, for we are plundered!
O Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil so that you may be saved. How long shall your vain thoughts lodge within you?
For a voice declares from Dan, and proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim.
Tell it to the nations: Behold! proclaim against Jerusalem! Watchers are going to come from a distant land; and they will utter their voice against the cities of Judah.
Like keepers of a field, they are against her all around; because she has rebelled against Me, says Jehovah.
Your way and your doings have procured these things for you; this is your evil, because it is bitter, because it reaches to your heart.
My stomach, my stomach! I am convulsed to my heart! My heart groans within me; I cannot be silent because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.
Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole land is devastated. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.
How long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of the shofar?
For My people are foolish; they have not known Me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
I looked on the earth, and, lo, it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
I looked on the mountains, and, lo, they quaked; and all the hills moved to and fro.
I looked, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.
I looked, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Jehovah, before His fierce anger.
For thus Jehovah has said, The whole land shall be desolate, yet I will not make a full end.
The earth shall mourn for this, and the heavens above shall be black, because I have spoken, I have purposed, and will not be moved to pity, nor will I turn back from it.
Every city shall flee at the sound of the horsemen and bowmen. They shall go into thickets and climb up among the rocks. Every city is abandoned, and not a man shall live in them.
And you, what will you do when you are ruined? Though you dress with crimson, though you put on ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes large with paint, you shall make yourself beautiful in vain; your lovers will despise you; they will seek your life.
For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor, the anguish as of one bearing her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, gasping and spreading her hands, saying, Woe to me now! For my soul is weary because of murderers.
Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in her open places, if you can find a man, if there is one who does justice, who seeks the truth; and I will pardon her.
And though they say, As Jehovah lives; surely they swear falsely.
O Jehovah, are not Your eyes on the truth? You have stricken them, but they have not grieved; You have destroyed them, but they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to return.
So I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they do not know the way of Jehovah, nor the judgment of their God.
I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of Jehovah and the judgment of their God. But these have broken the yoke together and have torn off the bonds!
Therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them, and a wolf of the deserts shall destroy them; a leopard shall watch over their cities. Everyone who goes out from there shall be torn in pieces, because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased.
How shall I pardon you for this? Your children have forsaken Me, and have sworn by those that are not gods. When I adjured them, then they committed adultery, and gathered themselves by troops in a harlot’s house.
They were like lusty, well-fed stallions in the morning; every one neighing after his neighbor’s wife.
Shall I not punish for these things? says Jehovah. And shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
Go up on her vine rows and destroy; but do not make a full end; take away her branches, for they are not Jehovah’s.
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against Me, says Jehovah.
They have denied Jehovah and said, It is not He; neither shall evil come upon us; nor shall we see sword nor famine.
And the prophets shall become wind, for the Word is not in them; thus it shall be done to them.
Therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, Because you speak this word, behold, I will make My Words in your mouth fire, and these people wood, and it shall devour them.
Lo, I will bring a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel, says Jehovah. It is an enduring nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor understand what they say.
Their quiver is as an open grave; they are all mighty men.
And they shall eat up your harvest and your bread. They will devour your sons and your daughters. They shall eat up your flocks and your herds; they shall eat up your vines and your fig trees. They shall beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.
But even in those days, says Jehovah, I will not make a complete end of you.
And it will be when you shall say, Why does Jehovah our God do all these things to us? then you shall answer them, Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
Declare this in the house of Jacob, and proclaim it in Judah, saying,
Now hear this, O foolish people, without understanding; who have eyes and see not; who have ears and hear not.
Do you not fear Me? says Jehovah. Will you not tremble at My presence, I who have placed the sand for the boundary of the sea by a perpetual decree, so that it cannot pass it? And though its waves toss to and fro, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it?
But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and departed.
Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah our God, who gives both the former and the latter rain in its season; He reserves unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good from you.
For among My people are found wicked ones; they lie in wait, as one who sets snares; they set a trap, they catch men.
Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and grown rich.
They have grown fat, they gleam. Yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked; they do not plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may get rich; and they do not judge the right of the needy.
Shall I not punish for these things? says Jehovah. Shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land.
The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their own power; and my people love to have it so, and what will you do in the end?
O children of Benjamin, seek refuge out of the midst of Jerusalem. Blow the shofar in Tekoa, and set up a signal-fire in Beth-haccerem; for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.
I will destroy the daughter of Zion, being delicate in her dwelling place.
The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch tents against her all around; they shall feed each one in his place.
Prepare war against her; arise and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
For thus has Jehovah of Hosts said, Cut down trees and cast a mound against Jerusalem! This is the city to be punished; she is full of oppression in her midst.
As a fountain keeps fresh its waters, so she keeps fresh her evil; violence and devastation is heard in her; before Me continually are sickness and wounds.
O Jerusalem, be instructed, lest My soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine; as a grape gatherer, put your hand back to the branches.
To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot give heed. Behold, the Word of Jehovah is a reproach to them; they have no delight in it.
Therefore I am full of the fury of Jehovah; I am weary with holding it in; I will pour it out on the children outside, and on the group of young men together. For even the husband shall be taken along with the wife, the aged who is full of days.
And their houses shall be turned over to others, together with their fields and wives; for I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah.
For everyone from the least of them even to the greatest of them profits from unjust gain; and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
They have also healed the ruin of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush; therefore they shall fall among those who fall. At the time that I punish them they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah, Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths where the good way is, and walk in it, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in it.
Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the shofar. But they said, We will not listen.
Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is coming upon them.
Hear, O earth; behold, I will bring evil on this people, the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not heeded My Words, nor My Law, but rejected it.
For what purpose does frankincense come to Me from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not pleasing, nor are your sacrifices sweet to Me.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble on them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.
Thus says Jehovah, Behold, a people comes from the land of the north, and a great nation shall be aroused from the extremities of the earth.
They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array against you as men of war, O daughter of Zion.
We have heard the rumor of it; our hands become feeble; anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in labor.
Do not go out into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear are on every side.
O daughter of my people, put on sackcloth, and wallow in ashes; make mourning for yourself, as for an only son, most bitter wailing; for the destruction shall suddenly come upon us.
I have set you up as an inspector, and a fortress among My people, that you may know and examine their way.
They all stubbornly rebel, walking in slanders; they are bronze and iron; they are all corrupters.
The bellows are scorched, the lead is consumed by the fire; the refiner melts in vain; for the wicked are not drawn off.
Rejected silver they call them, because Jehovah has rejected them.
The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, and proclaim there this Word, and say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah, who enter in at these gates to bow down to Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Make your ways and your doings good, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
Do not trust in lying words, saying, The temple of Jehovah, The temple of Jehovah, This is the temple of Jehovah.
For if you thoroughly make your ways and your doings good; if you work to execute justice between a man and his neighbor;
if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor walk after other gods to your hurt;
then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, forever and ever.
Behold, you trust in lying words that are of no benefit.
Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know;
and then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, We are delivered to do all those abominations?
Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, says Jehovah.
But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of My people Israel.
And now, because you have done all these works, says Jehovah, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear; and I called you, but you did not answer;
therefore I will do to this house, which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, the whole seed of Ephraim.
Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry nor prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you.
Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger.
Do they provoke Me to anger? says Jehovah. Is it not themselves, to the shame of their own faces.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah, Behold, My anger and My fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Snatch away your burnt offerings from your sacrifices, and eat flesh.
For I did not speak to your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.
But this is what I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people; and walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, so that it may be well with you.
But they did not listen, nor extend their ear, but walked in their own plans, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward and not forward.
Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.
Yet they did not listen to Me, nor extend their ear, but hardened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.
Therefore you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; you shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.
But you shall say to them, This is a nation which does not obey the voice of Jehovah their God, nor receives instruction; truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
Cut off your hair and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the desolate heights. For Jehovah has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.
For the sons of Judah have done evil in My eyes, says Jehovah. They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, in order to defile it.
They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I did not command them, nor did it even come into My heart.
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they shall bury in Tophet, until there is no more room.
And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.
Then I will cause the voice of gladness to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. For the land shall be desolate.
At that time, says Jehovah, they shall bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of its rulers, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.
And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of the heavens, which they have loved and which they have served, and after which they have walked, and which they have sought, and to which they have bowed down. They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be as dung on the face of the earth.
And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the rest of those who remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Moreover you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and not return?
Why has this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a continual backsliding? They hold fast to deceit; they refuse to return.
I listened and heard, but they did not speak right; no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Everyone turned to his own course, as a horse rushes into the battle.
Yea, the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times; and the turtledove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people do not know the judgment of Jehovah.
How can you say, We are wise, and the Law of Jehovah is with us? Lo, certainly the lying pen of the scribes has written falsehood.
The wise are ashamed, they are dismayed, and are captured. Lo, they have rejected the Word of Jehovah; so what wisdom is in them?
Therefore I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall inherit them, for everyone from the least even to the greatest profits from unjust gain. From the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.
For they have healed the ruin of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
Were they ashamed when they had committed abominations? No, they were not at all ashamed, nor did they know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; in the time of their punishment they shall be cast down, says Jehovah.
I will utterly consume them, says Jehovah; there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; I give them to those who pass through.
Why do we sit still? Gather yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there. For Jehovah our God has put us to silence, and has given us bitter water to drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.
We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, but behold, terror!
The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his valiant ones. For they have come, and devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those who live in it.
For, behold, I will send serpents and vipers among you, which cannot be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Jehovah.
I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint within me.
Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land. Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her King in her? Why have they provoked Me to anger with their graven images, with foreign vanities?
The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
For the ruin of the daughter of my people I am broken; I am in gloom; horror has seized me.
Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not come?
Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place for travelers, that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.
And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies. But they are not mighty for the truth on the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they do not know Me, says Jehovah.
Everyone beware of his neighbor, and do not trust any brother! For every brother will supplant and assail his neighbor, and will walk with slanderers.
And everyone will deceive his neighbor and will not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and they weary themselves to commit iniquity.
Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know Me, says Jehovah.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will refine them and try them; for how else shall I deal with the daughter of My people?
Their tongue is a slaughtering arrow; it speaks deceit; one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lies in wait.
Shall I not punish them for these things? says Jehovah; shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
I will take up a weeping and a wailing for the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the wilderness; because they are burned up, so that no one can pass through them; nor can men hear the voice of the cattle. Both the birds of the heavens and the beasts have fled; they are gone.
And I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.
Who is the wise man who may understand this? And who is he to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may declare it? Why does the land perish and burn up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?
And Jehovah says, Because they have forsaken My Law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, and have not walked in it,
but they have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and make them drink bitter water.
I will also scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Consider carefully, and call for those who lament, that they may come. And send for the wise women, that they may come;
and let them make haste and take up a lamentation for us, so that our eyes may run down with tears, and waters flow from our eyelids.
For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion. How we are plundered! We are greatly ashamed, because we have forsaken the land, because they have thrown down our tents.
Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O women, and let your ear receive the Word of His mouth, and teach your daughters a mourning song, and each one teach her neighbor a lamentation.
For death has come up into our windows, and has entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from outside and the young men from the streets.
Speak, Thus says Jehovah, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the fallen grain after the reaper; and no one shall gather them.
Thus says Jehovah, Let not the wise glory in his wisdom, nor let the mighty glory in his might; let not the rich glory in his riches;
but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am Jehovah, doing kindness, justice, and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I delight, says Jehovah.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish all the circumcised along with the uncircumcised;
Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all who are in the remotest quarters, who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.
Hear the Word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel.
Thus says Jehovah, Do not learn the way of the nations, and do not be dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations are dismayed at them.
For the customs of the people are vain; for one cuts a tree out of the forest with the ax, the work of the hands of the craftsman.
They make it beautiful with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and hammers, so that it will not totter.
They are crafted into hammered work like a palm tree, and they cannot speak. They must be lifted up and carried, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they are not able to do evil, neither is it in them to do good.
There is none like You, O Jehovah; You are great, and Your name is great in might.
Who would not fear You, O King of nations? For fear is befitting to You, because among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You.
But they are, every one of them, dull-hearted and foolish; a piece of wood is a discipline in vanities.
Silver beaten into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the craftsman, and of the hands of the goldsmith. Violet and purple is their clothing; they are all the work of skillful ones.
But Jehovah is the true God, He is the living God, and the eternal King. At His wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to endure His indignation.
So you shall say to them, The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.
He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
When He utters His voice, there is the noise of much water in the heavens. He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightnings with the rain, and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.
Every man is stupid in his knowledge; every refiner is dried up by the graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and no breath is in them.
They are vanity, the work of delusion; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.
The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Maker of all things; and Israel is the rod of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.
Gather up your bundle from the ground, you who live under the siege.
For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land this once, and will distress them, so that they may find Me.
Woe to me for my ruin! My wound makes me sick. But I said, Surely this is an infirmity, and I must bear it.
My tent is plundered, and all my cords are broken; my children have gone away from me, and they are not. There is no one to stretch out my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
For the shepherds have become stupid, and have not sought Jehovah, therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.
Behold, the sound of the report has come, and a great commotion out of the land of the north, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a den of dragons.
O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man who walks to direct his own steps.
O Jehovah, correct me, but with justice; not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing.
Pour out Your fury on the nations who do not know You, and on the families who do not call on Your name; for they have eaten up Jacob and have devoured him, and have destroyed him, and have made his dwelling place desolate.
The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah saying,
Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and say to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,
which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey My voice and do according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God;
so that I may fulfill the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered and said, Amen, O Jehovah.
Then Jehovah said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.
For I admonished and testified to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, Obey My voice.
Yet they did not obey nor extend their ear, but walked each one in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did not do them.
And Jehovah said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear My Words. And they went after other gods, to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.
Therefore Jehovah says this: Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to Me, I will not listen to them.
Then shall the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense. But they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah. And according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.
Therefore, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.
What is My beloved doing in My house, since she has worked out many evil devices? Has the holy flesh taken away your evil from you? How then do you rejoice?
Jehovah called your name, Green Olive Tree, fair, with fine fruit. With a great roaring sound He has set fire to it, and its branches are broken.
For Jehovah of Hosts who planted you has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
And Jehovah gave me knowledge of it, and I made it known; for You showed me their doings.
But I was like a docile lamb being led to the slaughter. And I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may be remembered no more.
But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the mind and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For to You I have laid open my cause.
Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, Do not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, that you do not die by our hand.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine;
and there shall be no remnant of them. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their punishment.
Righteous are You, O Jehovah, when I complain to You; yet let me speak with You about Your judgments. Why does the way of the wicked prosper? Why are all those who deceive with treachery at ease?
You have planted them; yea, they take root. They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far from their heart.
But You, O Jehovah, know me. You have seen me and tried my heart toward You. Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and consecrate them for the day of slaughter.
How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither from the evil of those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds have been swept away; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
If you have run with footmen, and they wore you out, then how can you compete with horses? And if you feel secure in the land of peace, then how will you do in the swelling of the Jordan?
For even your brothers and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you. Yea, they have called out a multitude after you. Do not believe them, though they speak pleasant things to you.
I have forsaken My house; I have left My inheritance. I have given the dearly beloved of My soul into the hand of her enemies.
My inheritance is to Me as a lion in the forest; it cries out against Me; therefore I have hated it.
My inheritance is like a speckled bird to Me; the birds all around are against her. Go, gather all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.
Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard; they have trampled My portion under foot; they have made My pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
They have made it a desolation. Being desolate, it mourns to Me. The whole land is made desolate because no man lays it to heart.
The plunderers have come upon all high places through the wilderness; for the sword of Jehovah shall devour from one end of the land even to the other end of the land. No flesh shall have peace.
They have sown wheat, but reap thorns. They have tired themselves out, but to no profit. And they shall be ashamed of your harvests because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah against all My evil neighbors who touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.
And it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them, and will bring them back, each man to his inheritance and each man to his land.
And it shall be, if they will carefully learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, As Jehovah lives (as they taught the people to swear by Baal), then they shall be established in the midst of My people.
But if they will not obey, I will pull up, root out, and destroy that nation, says Jehovah.
Thus Jehovah said to me, Go and buy for yourself a linen waistband, and put it around your waist, and do not put it in water.
So I bought a waistband according to the Word of Jehovah, and put it around my waist.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me a second time, saying,
Take the waistband that you bought, which is around your waist, and arise. Go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
So I went and hid it by Euphrates, as Jehovah commanded me.
And it came to pass at the end of many days that Jehovah said to me, Arise, go to the Euphrates and take the waistband from there, which I commanded you to hide there.
Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it. And, behold, the waistband was rotten; it was good for nothing.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Thus says Jehovah, In this way I will spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
This evil people, who refuse to hear My Words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, shall even be like this waistband, which is good for nothing.
For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me, says Jehovah; so that they might be a people unto Me, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hear.
So you shall speak to them this Word: Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine. And they shall say to you, Do we not perceive to know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?
Then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit on David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
And I will smash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, says Jehovah. I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but will destroy them.
Hear and give ear; do not be proud; for Jehovah has spoken.
Give glory to Jehovah your God, before He causes darkness, and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains, and, while you are looking for light, He turns it into the shadow of death, and makes it gross darkness.
But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep and cry and run down with tears, because Jehovah’s flock is taken captive.
Say to the king and to the queen mother, Humble yourselves; sit down, for your dominion has come down, even the crown of your glory.
The cities of the south have been shut up, and no one is opening; Judah has been exiled, all of it has been completely carried away captive.
Lift up your eyes and look at those who come from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you, your beautiful sheep?
What will you say when he punishes you? For you have taught them to be chief rulers over you. Do not pangs seize you, like a woman in travail?
And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come upon me? It is because of the greatness of your iniquity; your skirts have been uncovered, and your heels have suffered violence.
Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard its spots? Then you also may do good, who are accustomed to doing evil.
Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
This is your lot, the portion I have measured to you, says Jehovah, because you have forgotten Me and trusted in falsehood.
Therefore I also have drawn up your skirts over your face, that your shame may be seen.
I have seen your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your harlotry, and your abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! Will you not be made clean? How long will it still be?
The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah concerning the droughts.
Judah mourns, and its gates languish. They mourn for the land, and the cry of Jerusalem has gone up.
And their nobles have sent their little ones for water; they came to the cisterns, and found no water. They returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.
Because the ground is parched, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed; they covered their heads.
Yea, the doe also gave birth in the field and abandoned it, because there was no grass.
And the wild asses stood in the high places; they sniffed at the wind like dragons; their eyes failed because there was no grass.
O Jehovah, though our iniquities testify against us, work for Your name’s sake; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against You.
O the Hope of Israel, its Savior in time of trouble, why should You be like a sojourner in the land, and like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night?
Why should You be like a man astonished, as a mighty one who cannot save? Yet You, O Jehovah, are in our midst, and we are called by Your name. Do not leave us!
Thus says Jehovah to this people: Thus they have loved to wander; they have not restrained their feet; therefore Jehovah does not accept them. He will now remember their iniquity and punish their sins.
Then Jehovah said to me, Do not pray for this people for their good.
When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
Then I said, Ah, O Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets are saying to them, You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine; but I will give you sure peace in this place.
And Jehovah said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I did not send them, nor have I commanded them, nor did I speak to them. They prophesy to you a false vision and a worthless divination, and a thing of no value, and the deceit of their heart.
Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, when I did not send them (yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land): by sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.
And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them; either them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. For I will pour their evil upon them.
Therefore you shall speak this word to them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and do not let them cease. For the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great break, with a sickening blow.
If I go out into the field, then I see those killed with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, behold, those that are sick from famine! Yes, both the prophet and the priest have gone up into a land that they do not know.
Have You utterly rejected Judah? Has Your soul loathed Zion? Why have You stricken us such that there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for the time of healing, and behold, terror!
We acknowledge, O Jehovah, our wickedness, the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against You.
Do not abhor us; for Your name’s sake do not disgrace the throne of Your glory; remember, do not break Your covenant with us.
Are there any among the vain idols of the nations who can make it rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Is it not You, O Jehovah our God. Therefore we will wait upon You; for You have made all these things.
Then Jehovah said to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul could not be inclined toward this people. Send them out of My sight, and let them go out.
And it shall come to pass that if they say to you, Where shall we go? Then you shall tell them, Thus says Jehovah: Those who are for death, to death; and those for the sword, to the sword; and those for the famine, to the famine; and those for the captivity, to the captivity.
And I will set over them four kinds, says Jehovah; the sword to kill, and the dogs to drag, and the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy.
And I will make them a horror to all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.
For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan you? Or who shall turn aside to ask after your welfare?
You have forsaken Me, says Jehovah; you have gone backward; therefore I will stretch out My hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with sorrow.
And I will winnow them with a pitch fork in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children; I will destroy My people, since they have not turned back from their ways.
Their widows are more numerous around Me than the sand of the seas; I have brought on them, against a mother of a young man, a plunderer at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to fall suddenly upon the city.
She who bore seven languishes; she has breathed out her life; her sun has gone down while it was yet day. She has been ashamed and confounded; and I will deliver the rest of them to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.
Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither loaned with usury, nor have men loaned to me; yet every one curses me.
Jehovah said, Truly I will not free you for good. Truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
Can anyone break iron, iron or bronze from the north?
Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoils without price, because of all your sins, even in all your borders.
And I will make you pass over with your enemies into a land which you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in My anger, which shall burn against you.
O Jehovah, You know; remember me and visit me, and take vengeance for me on those who persecute me. In Your long-suffering do not take me away; know that for Your sake I have suffered rebuke.
Your Words were found, and I ate them; and Your Word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; for I am called by Your name, O Jehovah the God of Hosts.
I did not sit in the council of the mockers, nor rejoice; I sat alone because of Your hand; for You have filled me with indignation.
Why has my pain been continual, and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? You surely are to me like deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, If you turn back, then I will bring you back again; you shall stand before Me. And if you take the precious out from the vile, you shall be as My mouth. Let them turn back to you, but do not return to them.
And I will make you to this people a fortified wall of bronze; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Jehovah.
And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the grip of the terrible.
The Word of Jehovah also came unto me, saying,
You shall not take a wife for yourself, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.
For thus says Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who begot them in this land:
They shall die from deaths of diseases; they shall not be mourned, nor shall they be buried. But they shall be as dung on the face of the earth. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.
For thus says Jehovah, Do not enter into the house of mourning; do not go to weep nor bemoan them. For I have taken away My peace from this people, says Jehovah, even lovingkindness and mercies.
Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, nor shall men mourn for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.
Nor shall anyone break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Nor shall anyone give them the cup of comfort to drink for their father or for their mother.
Also you shall not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will cause the voice of mirth to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, and the voice of gladness, and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
And it shall be, when you proclaim to this people all these words, and they shall say to you, Why has Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us? Or what is our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have sinned against Jehovah our God?
Then you shall say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken Me, says Jehovah, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have bowed down to them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My Law.
And you have done worse than your fathers; for behold, you walk, each one, after the stubbornness of his evil heart, and do not listen to Me.
Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night; where I will not grant you favor.
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that it shall no more be said, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;
but rather, As Jehovah lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands where He had driven them. For I will bring them back into their land that I gave to their fathers.
Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Jehovah, and they will fish for them. And afterwards I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes.
And first I will repay double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land, they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things.
O Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the nations shall come to You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?
Therefore behold, this once I will make them know; I will cause them to know My hand and My might; and they shall know that My name is Jehovah.
The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus; it is engraved on the tablet of the heart and on the horns of Your altar with the point of a diamond;
while their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees on the high hills.
O My mountain in the field, I will give your wealth and all your treasures for plunder, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.
And you, even yourself, have let go of the inheritance which I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in a land which you do not know. For you have kindled a fire in My anger, which shall burn forever.
Thus says Jehovah, Cursed is the man who trusts in man, and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart departs from Jehovah.
For he shall be destitute in the wilderness, and shall not see when good comes. But he shall live in the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land that is not inhabited.
Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah, and Jehovah is his refuge.
For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters; it sends out its roots by the river, and it shall not fear when the heat comes, but its foliage shall be green; and he is not anxious in the year of drought, nor will it cease from yielding fruit.
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?
I Jehovah search the heart, I examine the soul, even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
The partridge sets on eggs and does not hatch them; in the same way he who gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end he shall be a fool.
A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
O Jehovah, the Hope of Israel, all who forsake You shall be ashamed. Those who depart from Me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Jehovah, the Fountain of Living Waters.
Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved; for You are my praise.
Behold, they say to me, Where is the Word of Jehovah? Let it come now!
As for me, I have not hurried away from being a shepherd who follows You; nor have I desired the woeful day; You surely know the going forth of my lips before Your face.
Do not be a terror to me; You are my hope in the day of evil.
Let those who persecute me be ashamed, but do not let me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but do not let me be dismayed. Bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
Thus Jehovah said unto me: Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;
and say to them, Hear the Word of Jehovah, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates!
Thus says Jehovah, Take heed to yourselves, and carry no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
Nor carry out a burden from your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work, but consecrate the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.
But they did not obey, nor extend their ear, but made their neck stiff, so that they might not hear nor receive instruction.
And it shall be, if you listen and give heed to Me, says Jehovah, to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but consecrate the Sabbath day, to do no work in it;
then kings and rulers sitting on the throne of David shall enter the gates of this city, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their rulers, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall remain forever.
And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the valleys, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and grain offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of Jehovah.
But if you will not listen to me to consecrate the Sabbath day, to not carry a burden when entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
The Word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear My Words.
Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he was fashioning an object on the wheel.
And the vessel that he made of clay was ruined in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter? says Jehovah. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hands, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
The instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck it up; or to pull it down, and to destroy it;
if that nation, against whom I have spoken, will turn from their evil, I will be moved with compassion regarding the evil that I thought to do to them.
And the instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and plant it;
if it does evil in My eyes, so that it does not obey My voice, then I will regret the good by which I said I would do good to them.
Now then, go speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am forming evil against you, and devising a plan against you. Return now, each one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.
And they said, There is no hope; but we will walk after our own thoughts, and we will each one do according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, Ask now among the nations; who has heard the likes of this? The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
Does the snow of Lebanon avoid the rock of the field? Or shall the cold flowing waters be forsaken for that which comes from another place?
Because My people have forgotten Me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in byways, and not in the highway,
to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing. Everyone who passes by will be appalled, and will wag his head.
I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
Then they said, Come and let us devise schemes against Jeremiah. For the Law shall not perish from the priest, nor wisdom from the wise, nor the Word from the prophet. Come and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.
Give attention to me; O Jehovah, and hear the voice of those who contend with me.
Should evil be repaid for good? For they have dug a pit for my life. Remember that I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your wrath from them.
Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the hand of the sword. Let their wives be bereaved, and become widows. Let their men be slain to death, and their young men struck by the sword in battle.
Let a cry be heard from their houses, when You suddenly bring a troop upon them. For they have dug a pit to take me, and have hidden snares for my feet.
Yet, Jehovah, You know all their counsel against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from Your sight, but let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
Thus says Jehovah, Go and get a potter’s earthen jar, and assemble some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests.
And go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom which is by the entry of Potsherd Gate. And there proclaim the words that I shall tell you.
And say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which shall cause the ears of him who hears it to tingle,
because they have forsaken Me, and have given regard to this place and have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents.
They have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I never commanded nor spoke, nor did it even come into My mind.
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but The Valley of Slaughter.
And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of those who seek their lives. And I will give their corpses as food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth.
And I will make this city a desolation and a hissing. Everyone who passes by shall be amazed and shall hiss because of all its plagues.
And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall each one eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall distress them.
Then you shall break the jar before the eyes of the men who go with you,
and shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again. And they shall bury them in Tophet until there is no place left to bury.
I will do this to this place, says Jehovah, and to its inhabitants, and make this city as Tophet.
And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be as defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of the heavens, and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.
Then Jeremiah came from Tophet, where Jehovah had sent him to prophesy. And he stood in the court of Jehovah’s house, and said to all the people,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their necks so that they might not hear My Words.
Now Pashur, the son of Immer the priest (he was chief officer in the house of Jehovah), heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.
Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of Jehovah.
And it happened on the next day that Pashur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Jehovah has not called your name Pashur, but Magor-Missabib.
For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. And they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and kill them with the sword.
And I will give all the wealth of this city, and its produce, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; who will plunder them and take them, and bring them to Babylon.
And you, Pashur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. And you shall go to Babylon, and you shall die there, and shall be buried there; you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.
O Jehovah, You have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I, and You have prevailed. I am in derision all the day; everyone mocks me.
For whenever I speak, I cry out, I cry violence and devastation; for the Word of Jehovah has been a reproach and a derision to me all the day.
Then I said, I will not make mention of Him, nor speak in His name any more. But His Word was in my heart like a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with holding it in, and I could not.
For I have heard the whisperings of many, terror is all around. Proclaim, they say, and we will report it. Everyone at peace with me is watching for me to stumble and fall, saying, Perhaps he will be lured away, and we shall prevail against him, and shall take our revenge on him.
But Jehovah is with me like a mighty, awesome one. Therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail. They shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not succeed. Their everlasting reproach shall never be forgotten.
But, O Jehovah of Hosts, who tries the righteous and sees the soul and the heart, let me see Your vengeance on them. For I have made my cause known to You.
Sing to Jehovah! Praise Jehovah! For He has delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
Cursed be the day in which I was born; let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
Cursed be the man who brought news to my father, saying, A male child has been born to you; making him very glad.
And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew without compassion; and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;
because he did not kill me from the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb always pregnant.
Why did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
The Word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,
Please inquire of Jehovah for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is warring against us. Perhaps Jehovah will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, that he may depart from us.
Then Jeremiah said to them, Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls. And I will gather them together in the middle of this city.
And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.
And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
And afterward, says Jehovah, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those who are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And he shall strike them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, nor have pity, nor have mercy.
And to this people you shall say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. But he who goes out and prostrates himself to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be his prize.
For I have set My face against this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear the Word of Jehovah.
O house of David, thus says Jehovah: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley, rock of the plain, says Jehovah; who say, Who shall come down against us? Or who shall enter into our dwellings?
But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall devour all things around it.
Thus says Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak this Word there,
and say, Hear the Word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you and your servants, and your people who enter in by these gates.
Thus says Jehovah, Execute justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. And do no wrong, do no violence to the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.
For if indeed you do this thing, then there shall enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people.
But if you will not heed these Words, I swear by Myself, says Jehovah, that this house shall become a desolation.
For thus says Jehovah to the house of the king of Judah, You are Gilead to Me, the head of Lebanon. Yet surely I will make you a wilderness; cities which are not inhabited.
And I will prepare destroyers against you, each one with his weapons. And they shall cut down your choice cedars, and throw them into the fire.
And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say each one to his neighbor, Why has Jehovah done this to this great city?
Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah their God, and bowed down to other gods, and served them.
Weep not for the dead, nor moan for him; but weep bitterly for him who goes away. For he shall return no more, nor see his native land.
For thus says Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned in the place of Josiah his father, who went forth out of this place: he shall not return there any more.
But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.
Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness and his upper rooms without justice; his neighbor serves without pay, and is given nothing for his work;
who says, I will build myself a wide house and large rooms, and has cut out windows for himself, and the ceiling is paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
Shall you reign, because you lust after cedar? Did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.
He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Was this not knowledge of Me? says Jehovah.
But your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your unjust gain, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and to do violence.
Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, They shall not mourn for him, saying, Alas, my brother! or, Alas, sister! They shall not mourn for him, saying, Alas, master! or, Alas, his majesty!
He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
Go up to Lebanon, and cry out; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers are destroyed.
I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your way from your youth, for you have not obeyed My voice.
The wind shall eat up all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity; surely then you will be ashamed and humiliated for all your wickedness.
O inhabitant of Lebanon, nesting in the cedars, how you will be pitied when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman giving birth!
As I live, says Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on My right hand, yet I would tear you out of there!
And I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
And I will cast you out, along with your mother who bore you, into another land where you were not born; and there you shall die.
But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return.
Is this man Coniah a despised and broken vessel? Is he an object in which there is no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they do not know?
O earth, earth, earth, hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says Jehovah, Write this man down as childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall succeed, sitting on the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.
Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture! says Jehovah.
Therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, against the shepherds who feed My people, You have scattered My flock, and have driven them away, and have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings, says Jehovah.
And I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the lands where I have driven them, and will bring them back to their folds. And they shall be fruitful and multiply.
And I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them. And they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed; nor shall they be lacking, says Jehovah.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King who shall reign and act prudently, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the earth.
In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely. And this is His name by which He shall be called, JEHOVAH, OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Therefore, behold, the days come, says Jehovah, that they shall no longer say, Jehovah lives, who brought the sons of Israel up out of the land of Egypt;
but, Jehovah lives, who brought up and led the seed of the house of Israel out of the land of the north, and from all lands where I have driven them. And they shall dwell in their own land.
My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake. I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of Jehovah, and because of the Words of His holiness.
For the land is full of adulterers. Yes, because of cursing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their strength is not right.
For both prophet and priest are corrupt; yes, in My house I have found their evil, says Jehovah.
So their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall in them; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their punishment, says Jehovah.
And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal and caused My people Israel to go astray.
I have also seen in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing; they commit adultery and walk in falsehood. They also strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns back from his evil; they are all of them like Sodom to Me, and its inhabitants like Gomorrah.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts concerning the prophets: Behold, I will feed them wormwood, and make them drink bitter water; for godlessness has gone forth from the prophets of Jerusalem into all the land.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They fill you with vanities; they speak a vision from their own heart, not out of the mouth of Jehovah.
They speak to those who despise Me, promising, Jehovah has said, You shall have peace! And they say to everyone who walks after the stubbornness of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you!
For who has stood in the counsel of Jehovah, and has perceived and heard His Word? Who has paid attention to His Word and heeded it?
Behold, a tempest from Jehovah has gone forth in fury, a whirling tempest. It shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.
The anger of Jehovah shall not turn back, until He has executed and until He has fulfilled the purposes of His heart; in the latter days you shall diligently consider it with understanding.
I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.
But if they had stood in My counsel and had caused My people to hear My Words, then they would have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.
Am I a God near by, says Jehovah, and not a God afar off?
Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I shall not see him? says Jehovah. Do I not fill the heavens and earth? says Jehovah.
I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in My name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart,
who think to cause My people to forget My name by their dreams which they tell, each one to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten My name for Baal.
The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream. And he who has My Word, let him speak My Word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? says Jehovah.
Is not My Word like a fire? says Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I am against the prophets who steal My Words each one from his neighbor.
Jehovah says, Behold, I am against the prophets who use their tongues and say, He says.
Jehovah says, Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams and tell them, and cause My people to go astray by their lies and by their foolishness. Yet I did not send them nor command them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all, says Jehovah.
And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask you, saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? You shall then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, says Jehovah.
And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, The burden of Jehovah! I will even punish that man and his house.
And you shall say each one to his neighbor, and each one to his brother, What has Jehovah answered? and, What has Jehovah spoken?
And you shall mention the burden of Jehovah no more. For every man’s word shall be his burden; for you have perverted the Words of the living God, of Jehovah of Hosts our God.
Thus you shall say to the prophet, What has Jehovah answered you? and, What has Jehovah spoken?
But since you say, The burden of Jehovah! therefore thus says Jehovah, Because you say this word (The burden of Jehovah), and I have sent to you saying, You shall not say, The burden of Jehovah;
therefore behold, I, even I, will completely forget you, and I will forsake you and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence.
And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.
Jehovah caused me to see, and behold, two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah (after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the rulers of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon);
one basket had very good figs, like the first ripe figs. And the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.
Then Jehovah said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so that they cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will acknowledge the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for good.
For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. And I will build them and not pull them down; and I will plant them and not pluck them up.
And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Jehovah; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God. For they shall return to Me with their whole heart.
And like the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus says Jehovah, Thus I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his rulers, and the rest of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt;
and I will deliver them over in horror into all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, for a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, there in all the places where I shall drive them.
And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, until they are destroyed from the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
The Word that came unto Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (It was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon);
which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, which is the twenty-third year, the Word of Jehovah has come unto me; and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but you have not listened.
And Jehovah has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but you have not listened nor extended your ear to hear.
They said, Turn back now, each one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Jehovah has given to you and to your fathers forever and ever.
And do not go after other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no harm.
Yet you have not listened to Me, says Jehovah, so that you might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Because you have not given heed to My Words,
behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, says Jehovah, and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations all around. And I will completely destroy them, and make them a waste, and a hissing, and perpetual ruins.
And I will take from them the voice of rejoicing and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.
And this whole land shall be a ruin and a waste. And these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are fulfilled, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, and the land of the Chaldeans for their iniquity, says Jehovah; and I will make it a perpetual desolation.
And I will bring on that land all My Words which I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
For many nations and great kings shall lay service upon them also. And I will repay them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.
For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel to me, Take the wine cup of this wrath from My hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.
And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and go mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
Then I took the cup from Jehovah’s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me;
Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, their kings and their rulers, to make them a desolation, a horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants, his rulers, and all his people;
and all the people mixed together, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the rest of Ashdod;
Edom, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon;
and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon; and the kings of the coastlands beyond the sea,
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and those who are cut off at the remotest regions;
and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the people mixed together who dwell in the desert;
and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;
and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
Therefore you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Drink and be drunk, and vomit, and fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
And it shall be, that if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, You shall certainly drink.
For, lo, I am beginning to bring evil on the city which is called by My name; and should you be found clean and free from guilt? You shall not be without guilt, for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Therefore prophesy against them all these Words, and say to them, Jehovah shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation. He shall mightily roar over His dwelling place. He shall give a shout, like those who tread out grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
A roaring noise shall come to the ends of the earth; for Jehovah has a controversy with the nations; He will enter into judgment with all flesh. He will give those who are wicked to the sword, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be roused up from the recesses of the earth.
And in that day the slain of Jehovah shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be mourned, nor gathered, nor buried. They shall be as dung on the ground.
Howl, you shepherds, and cry! Wallow in the ashes, you majestic ones of the flock! For the days of your slaughter and of your scattering are fulfilled; and you shall fall like a delightful vessel.
And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the majestic ones of the flock to escape.
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the majestic ones of the flock shall be heard; for Jehovah has spoiled their pasture,
and the peaceful pastures are cut down because of the fierce anger of Jehovah.
He has left His den like a lion; for their land is wasted at the presence of His fierce violence, and before His fierce anger.
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this Word came from Jehovah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah’s house and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to bow down in Jehovah’s house, all the Words that I command you to speak to them; do not diminish a word.
It may be that they will listen, and each man turn from his evil way, that I may be moved to compassion from the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings.
And you shall say to them, Thus says Jehovah: If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My Law which I have set before you,
to listen to the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened);
then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.
So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.
And it happened when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that Jehovah had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall die the death!
Why have you prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be wasted, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.
When the rulers of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house to the house of Jehovah, and sat down in the entrance of the New Gate of Jehovah’s house.
And the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and to all the people, saying, Sentence this man to death, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.
Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
Now therefore, make your ways and your doings good, and obey the voice of Jehovah your God. And Jehovah will show compassion regarding the evil that He has spoken against you.
As for me, behold, I am in your hand. Do with me as seems good and right to you.
But know for certain that if you put me to death, you shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon its inhabitants; for truly Jehovah has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.
Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, This man is not worthy of death; for he has spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.
Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,
Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins, and the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.
Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah execute him to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and entreat Jehovah, and Jehovah had compassion regarding the evil which He had spoken against them? So we are doing great evil against our souls.
And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the rulers, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.
And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt; Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him into Egypt.
And they brought Urijah out of Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and threw his dead body into the graves of the common people.
But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, this Word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah to me, Make bonds and yokes for yourself, and put them on your neck,
and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
And command them to go to their masters, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Thus you shall say to your masters,
I have made the earth, man, and the animals on the face of the earth, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed right to Me.
And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant. And I have also given him the beasts of the field to serve him.
And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his land comes. And then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them.
And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish, says Jehovah, with the sword and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
Therefore, do not listen to your prophets, nor to your fortune tellers, nor to your dreamers, nor to your conjurers, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon.
For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out and you should perish.
But the nations who bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, those I will let remain on their own land, says Jehovah. And they shall work it and dwell in it.
I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, You shall not serve the king of Babylon. For they prophesy a lie to you.
For I have not sent them, says Jehovah; yet they prophesy a lie in My name, so that I might drive you out, and that you might perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.
Also I spoke to the priests and to all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of Jehovah’s house shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you.
Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. For why should this city be laid waste?
But if they are prophets, and if the Word of Jehovah is with them, let them now make entreaties to Jehovah of Hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the rest of the vessels which remain in this city,
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
yes, thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of Jehovah and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem:
They shall be carried to Babylon, and they shall be there until the day that I visit them, says Jehovah. Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.
And it happened in the same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur, the prophet of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Within two full years I will bring back into this place all the vessels of Jehovah’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried them to Babylon.
And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went into Babylon, says Jehovah; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of Jehovah,
even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen. May Jehovah do so. May Jehovah establish your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of Jehovah’s house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
But hear now this word that I speak in your ears and in the ears of all the people:
The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms; of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then the prophet shall be known, that Jehovah has truly sent him.
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it.
And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus says Jehovah, Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the time frame of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off of the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah: You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And they shall serve him. And I have given him the beasts of the field also.
Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah has not sent you, but you make this people to trust in a lie.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will drive you from off the face of the earth. You shall die this year, because you have taught rebellion against Jehovah.
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
And these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive from Jerusalem to Babylon.
(After Jeconiah the king, and the queen mother, and the officials, the rulers of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem.)
The letter came by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah the king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, to all the captives whom I caused to be taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:
Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their fruit.
Take wives and beget sons and daughters. And take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters, that you may be multiplied there and not diminished.
And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be exiled, and pray to Jehovah for it. For in its peace you shall have peace.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your fortune-tellers in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you dream.
For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says Jehovah.
For thus says Jehovah, When according to My Word seventy years have been fulfilled at Babylon, I will visit you and carry out My good Word to you, to bring you back to this place.
For I know the thoughts which I am planning for you, says Jehovah; thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.
Then you shall call on Me, and you shall go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.
And you shall seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.
And I will be found by you, says Jehovah; and I will bring you back from your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Jehovah. And I will bring you back into the place from where I caused you to be taken captive.
Because you have said, Jehovah has raised up prophets for us in Babylon;
thus says Jehovah concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brothers who have not gone out with you into captivity;
thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like overripe figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.
And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, and will make them objects of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and a waste, and a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
because they have not heeded My Words, says Jehovah, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but you would not obey, says Jehovah.
Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, all you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;
thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.
And a curse shall be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, May Jehovah make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,
because they have done disgraceful things in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them; for I am He who knows and is a witness, says Jehovah.
You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because you have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
Jehovah has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be officers in the house of Jehovah over every madman who prophesies, that you should put him in prison and in the stocks.
Now therefore why have you not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who prophesies to you?
For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long. Build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.
And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
Send to all the captives, saying, Thus says Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent him, and he caused you to trust in a lie,
therefore thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people; nor shall he behold the good which I shall do for My people, says Jehovah, because he has taught rebellion against Jehovah.
The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus speaks Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Write all the Words that I have spoken to you in a book.
For, lo, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will bring back the captives of My people Israel and Judah, says Jehovah. And I will cause them to return to the land that I gave their fathers, and they shall possess it.
And these are the Words that Jehovah spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
For thus says Jehovah, We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
Ask now, and see whether a man ever gives birth? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labor, and all faces are turned pale?
Alas! For that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
For it shall come to pass in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, that I will break his yoke from your neck and will burst your bonds. And strangers shall no longer enslave him,
but they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
Therefore, do not fear, O My servant Jacob, says Jehovah. Do not be dismayed, O Israel. For lo, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest, and be quiet, and no one shall make him afraid.
For I am with you, says Jehovah, to save you. Though I make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a complete end of you; but I will correct you in justice, and will not acquit nor leave you unpunished.
For thus says Jehovah, Your break is incurable, and your wound is making you sick.
There is no one to plead your cause; for your wounds there are no healing medicines.
All your lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you. For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the abundance of your iniquity, because your sins are many.
Why do you cry over your break? Your pain is incurable, because of the abundance of your iniquities; because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you.
Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity. And those who plunder you shall become plunder, and all who prey upon you I will give as prey.
For I will stir up health to you, and will heal you of your wounds, says Jehovah; because they called you an outcast, saying, This is Zion; no one seeks after her.
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will bring back the captives of Jacob’s tents, and will have mercy on his dwelling places. And the city shall be built on her own hill, and the palace shall remain in its own place.
And out of them shall come forth thanksgiving, and the voice of those who make merry. And I will multiply them, and they shall not diminish; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
Their children shall also be as they were before, and their congregation shall be established before Me, and I will punish all who oppress them.
And their rulers shall be from among themselves, and their governor shall come from their midst; and I will cause him to be brought near, and he shall draw near to Me. For who is this who pledged his heart to come near to Me? says Jehovah.
And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.
Behold, the tempest of Jehovah’s wrath goes forth, a roaring tempest; it shall whirl on the head of the wicked.
The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return until He has done it, and until He has fulfilled the purposes of His heart. In the latter days you shall understand it.
At that time, says Jehovah, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be My people.
Thus says Jehovah, The people who were survivors of the sword have found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I go to give him rest.
Jehovah has appeared to me from afar, saying, Yea, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with lovingkindness I have drawn you.
Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel. You shall again put on your tambourines, and shall go forth in the dances of those who rejoice.
You shall yet plant vines on the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common food.
For there shall be a day that the watchmen on Mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise and let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God!
For thus says Jehovah, Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations. Cry out, give praise and say, O Jehovah, save Your people, the remnant of Israel!
Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the recesses of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and she who is in labor with child, together; a great company shall return there.
They shall come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them. I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way; they shall not stumble in it, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn.
Hear the Word of Jehovah, O nations, and declare it on distant shores; and say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.
For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of the one stronger than him.
Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and the herd. And their souls shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not languish any more at all.
Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah: A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
Thus says Jehovah: Refrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says Jehovah. And they shall come back from the land of the enemy.
And there is hope for your future, says Jehovah, that your children shall come back to their own territory.
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, saying, You have chastised me, and I was chastised, like an untrained bull; draw me back, and I shall return. For You are Jehovah my God.
Surely after I was turned back, I repented; and after I was instructed, I struck my thigh. I was ashamed, yes, even humiliated, because I bore the reproach of my youth.
Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? For as often as I spoke against him, I call to mind and remember him still. Therefore My heart is stirred for him; I will have mercy and compassion upon him, says Jehovah.
Set up signposts, make landmarks for yourself. Set your heart toward the highway, the way you went. Turn back, O virgin of Israel, turn back to these cities of yours.
How long will you vacillate, O backsliding daughter? For Jehovah has created a new thing in the earth; a woman shall contain a man.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, They shall speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I shall bring back their captives, saying, Jehovah bless you, O habitation of justice and mountain of holiness.
And farmers, and those going forth with flocks, shall dwell together in Judah and in all its cities.
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have satisfied every sorrowful soul.
After this I awoke and looked around; and my sleep was sweet to me.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beasts.
And it shall come to pass that, as I have watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Jehovah.
In those days they shall not say any more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are dull.
But every man shall die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be dull.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah,
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Jehovah.
But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, says Jehovah, I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And they shall no more teach each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Jehovah. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.
Thus says Jehovah, who gives the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea when its waves roar (Jehovah of Hosts is His name);
if those ordinances depart from My presence, says Jehovah, then the seed of Israel shall also cease from being a nation before Me forever.
Thus says Jehovah, If the heavens above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth below can be searched out, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Jehovah.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that the city shall be built to Jehovah from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
And the measuring line shall come out to the hill Gareb, and shall go around to Goath.
And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to Jehovah. It shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more forever.
The Word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
For then the army of the king of Babylon besieged Jerusalem. And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah.
For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,
and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall be given over and delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,
and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed.
And Jeremiah said, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right of redemption is yours, to buy it.
So Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the Word of Jehovah and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the right of redemption is yours. Buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the Word of Jehovah.
And I bought the field in Anathoth, from Hanamel my uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of silver.
And I wrote it in the document, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.
So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and the open copy.
And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the eyes of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Take these documents, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open document, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may survive many days.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be acquired again in this land.
And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,
Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You.
You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the strong and Mighty God, Jehovah of Hosts, is His name,
great in counsel and mighty in work; for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.
For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel and among men; and have made Yourself a name, as it is this day;
and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
And they came in and possessed it, but they have not obeyed Your voice, nor walked in Your Law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them.
Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the pestilence. And what You have spoken has happened; and behold, there You see it.
And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; yet the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,
Behold, I am Jehovah the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?
Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.
And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.
For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger; they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.
And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it even enter My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
And now therefore, thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:
Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.
And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their children after them.
And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.
Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land, with all My heart and all My soul.
For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.
And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
Men shall buy fields for money, and write it in a document, and seal it, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south. For I will cause their captives to return, says Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the Maker, Jehovah who formed it in order to establish it; Jehovah is His name:
Call unto Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and unfathomable things which you do not know.
For thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to fortify against the siege mounds and the sword:
They come to fight with the Chaldeans, only to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in My anger and in My fury, for all whose evil I have hidden My face from this city.
Behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will heal them and will show them the abundance of peace and truth.
And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.
And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me; and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against Me.
And it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them. And they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the welfare that I am bringing to it.
Thus says Jehovah: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say is desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who shall say, Praise Jehovah of Hosts, for Jehovah is good, for His mercy is eternal; and the voice of those who shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of Jehovah. For I will cause the captives of the land to return, as at the first, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him who counts them, says Jehovah.
Behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will establish the good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.
In those days, and at that time, I will cause the Branch of Righteousness to grow up to David; and He shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
In those days Judah shall be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name by which she shall be called: JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
For thus says Jehovah, David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah: If you can break My covenant of the day and My covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,
then also may My covenant with David My servant be broken, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites the priests, My ministers.
As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so I will multiply the seed of David My servant and the Levites who serve Me.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,
Do you not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Jehovah has chosen, He has even cast them off? Thus they have despised My people, that they should no more be a nation before them.
Thus says Jehovah: If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,
then I will cast away the seed of Jacob, and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their captives, and have mercy on them.
The Word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all its cities; saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
And you shall not escape out of his hand, but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. And your eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth, and you shall go to Babylon.
Yet hear the Word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah, thus says Jehovah concerning you: You shall not die by the sword.
You shall die in peace; and as the burnings of incense for your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so they shall burn incense for you. And they shall lament for you, saying, Ah, lord! For I have spoken the Word, says Jehovah.
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem and against all the remaining cities of Judah; against Lachish, and against Azekah; for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.
The Word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;
that each man should let his male slave, and each man his female slave, if they were a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, to go free; that no one should keep a Jewish brother enslaved.
And all the rulers obeyed, and all the people who had entered into the covenant allowed them to go free, each man his male slave, and each man his female slave, so that no one should be enslaved among them any more; and they obeyed and let them go.
But afterward they changed their minds and caused the slaves and slave women whom they had let go free, to return! And they subjected them as slaves and slave women.
Therefore the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,
At the end of seven years let each man free his brother, a Hebrew, who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not heed me, nor extend their ears.
And you had turned today, and had done what was right in My eyes proclaiming liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.
But you turned and violated My name, and each man caused his slave, and each man his slave woman, whom you had set free to do as they pleased, to return. And you brought them back into bondage to be slaves and slave women to you.
Therefore thus says Jehovah: You have not heeded Me to proclaim liberty each man to his brother, and each man to his neighbor! Behold, I proclaim liberty for you, says Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. And I will cause you to be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not done the words of the covenant which they made before Me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts;
the rulers of Judah, and the rulers of Jerusalem, the officials, and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf;
I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. And their dead bodies shall be for food to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth.
And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his rulers, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, who have withdrawn from you.
Behold, I will command, says Jehovah, and cause them to return to this city. And they shall fight against it and capture it, and burn it with fire. And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.
The Word which came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.
Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brothers, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
And I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was near the room of the rulers, above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door.
And I set pots full of wine, and cups, before the sons of the house of the Rechabites. And I said to them, Drink wine!
But they said, We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons forever.
Nor shall you build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant a vineyard, nor have any of these; but all your days you shall live in tents, so that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.
So we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he has commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
nor to build houses for us to live in. Nor do we have vineyard, nor field, nor seed.
But we have lived in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
But it came to pass when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of Syria. So we are living at Jerusalem.
Then came the Word of Jehovah unto Jeremiah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction to heed My Words? says Jehovah.
The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are done. For to this day they do not drink, but obey their father’s commandment. But I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, but you have not heeded Me.
I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Turn back now each man from his evil way, and do good, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and you shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers. But you have not extended your ear, nor heeded Me.
Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have done the commandment of their father, which He commanded them; but this people has not heeded Me;
therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have spoken against them. Because I have spoken to them, but they have not given heed; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his precepts, and have done according to all that he has commanded you;
therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.
And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this Word came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,
Take for yourself a scroll of a book, and write in it all the Words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I plan to do to them, that they may turn, each man, from his evil way, so that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah. And Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of Jehovah, which He had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.
And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am confined. I cannot go into the house of Jehovah.
Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written at my mouth, the Words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in Jehovah’s house on the day of the fast. And also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.
It may be that they will present their supplication before Jehovah, and will turn back, each one from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah has pronounced against this people.
And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book, the Words of Jehovah in the house of Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem.
And Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entrance to the New Gate of the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.
When Michaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the Words of Jehovah from the book,
he then went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s room. And, lo, all the rulers sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers.
Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
Therefore all the rulers sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take the scroll in your hand from which you have read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
And it happened when they had heard all the words, that they turned to one another in fear and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?
Then Baruch answered them, He spoke all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
And the rulers said to Baruch, Go hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.
And they went in to the king, into the court. But they laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.
So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll. And he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the rulers who stood beside the king.
And the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, the fire burning in the hearth before him.
And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that he cut it with the scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire in the hearth, until all the scroll was burned up in the hearth.
Yet the king and all his servants who heard these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
But Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had entreated the king that he should not burn the scroll, but he would not consent to them.
And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But Jehovah hid them.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,
Take for yourself another scroll, and write in it all the former Words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus says Jehovah: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written in it, saying that the king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to be annihilated from there?
Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David. And his dead body shall be cast out into the heat of the day, and the frost of the night.
And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity. And I will bring upon them, and upon the people of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have spoken against them; but they have not given heed.
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote in it at the mouth of Jeremiah all the Words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many words like them were added to them.
And King Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah.
But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, gave heed to the Words of Jehovah which He spoke by the hand of the prophet Jeremiah.
And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to Jehovah our God for us.
And Jeremiah came in and went out among the people, for they had not yet put him into prison.
And Pharaoh’s army had come out from Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel: You shall say this to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.
And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and capture it, and burn it with fire.
Thus says Jehovah: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us. For they shall not depart.
For though you had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, each man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
And it happened when the army of Chaldeans went up from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,
that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to claim his property there in the midst of the people.
And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a commander of the guard named Irijah was there, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah. And he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are defecting to the Chaldeans.
Then Jeremiah said, False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans. But he did not listen to him; so Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the rulers.
And the rulers were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison, the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.
When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon and the cell, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,
then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. And the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any Word from Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is. For, He said, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, What have I offended against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?
Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land?
Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king; I beg you, let my supplication fall before you, so that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
And Zedekiah the king commanded that they should put Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and that they should give him a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street daily, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus, Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,
Thus says Jehovah, He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. But he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life as a prize, and shall live.
Thus says Jehovah: This city shall be given and bestowed into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall seize it.
Therefore the rulers said to the king, Please let this man be put to death. For in this way he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.
Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand. For the king cannot do a thing against you.
And they took Jeremiah and threw him into the pit of Malchijah the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the guard. And they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And there was no water in the pit, only mud. So Jeremiah sank into the mud.
And when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the officials in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the pit (the king was then sitting in the gate of Benjamin),
Ebed-melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying,
My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have thrown into the pit. And he is likely to die of hunger in the place where he is, for there is no more bread in the city.
Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take by your hand thirty men from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet up out of the pit before he dies.
So Ebed-melech took the men by his hand and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took worn out clothes and worn out rags from there, and let them down by ropes into the pit to Jeremiah.
And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Now put the worn out clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.
So they drew up Jeremiah with ropes and took him up out of the pit. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
And Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third gate of the house of Jehovah. And the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you something. Do not hide anything from me.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not execute me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not give heed to me.
So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Jehovah lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, Thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you will come out and go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire. And you and your house shall live.
But if you will not go forth to the rulers of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.
And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.
But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. I beg of you, obey the voice of Jehovah which I am speaking to you; so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.
But if you refuse to surrender, this is the Word that Jehovah has shown me:
Behold, all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah shall be brought out to the rulers of the king of Babylon, and they shall say, Your friends have enticed you, and have prevailed against you. Your feet have sunk in the mire, and they have turned away.
So they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. And you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And this city shall be burned with fire.
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.
But if the rulers hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death;
then you shall say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.
Then all the rulers came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they quit speaking with him; for the conversation had not been heard.
So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured. And he was there when Jerusalem was captured.
In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it.
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth of the month, the city was broken into.
And all the rulers of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the rest of the rulers of the king of Babylon.
And it came to pass that when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they fled, and went out from the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out the way of the plain.
But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And they took him, and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment upon him.
Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah. The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.
Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with chains, to bring him to Babylon.
And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who fell out and defected to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
Take him and look after him, and do him no evil; but do with him even as he says to you.
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the princes of the king of Babylon,
even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and assigned him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he lived among the people.
Now the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the guard, saying,
Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring My Words upon this city for evil and not for good. And they shall be done in that day before you.
But I will deliver you in that day, says Jehovah. And you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
For I will give you an escape, to deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me, says Jehovah.
This is the Word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had set him free from Ramah, when he had taken him, being bound in chains, from among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah, who were being carried away captive to Babylon.
And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, Jehovah your God has pronounced this evil against this place.
Now Jehovah has brought it, and has done according as He has said. Because you have sinned against Jehovah and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you.
And now, behold, I have set you free today from the chains on your hand. If it seems agreeable to you to come with me to Babylon, come; and I will see to your settlement. But if it is displeasing in your eyes to come with me into Babylon, stay. Behold, all the land is before you. Wherever it seems agreeable and right for you to go, go there.
And while he had not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and live with him among the people. Or go wherever it seems right to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gratuity, and let him go.
Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And he lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
And when all the commanders of the forces who were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had entrusted to him men, and women, and children, and many of the poor of the land, of those who were not exiled to Babylon;
then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai of Netopha, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men, saying, Do not fear to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
As for me, behold, I will live at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans who have come to us. But you go gather wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken.
Also when all the Jews in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan;
then all the Jews returned out of all the places where they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance.
Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,
and they said to him, You certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to kill you. But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.
Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know. Why should he kill you so that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely of Ishmael.
And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and the rulers of the king, and ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together at Mizpah.
Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.
And it came to pass on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah (and no one yet knew it),
that some men from Shechem came from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, with their beards shaved, and their clothes torn, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.
And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked. And it happened as he met them that he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
And so it happened when they came into the middle of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, he and the men with him, and threw them into the middle of the pit.
But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not kill us, for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he left off and did not kill them with their brothers.
And the pit into which Ishmael had thrown all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had killed because of Gedaliah, was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had entrusted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. And they found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
And it happened when all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, that they were glad.
So all the people that Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; the mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the officials, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
And they departed and stayed in the lodging place of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, to go to enter Egypt,
because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
Then all the commanders of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near,
and they said to Jeremiah the prophet, Please let us prostrate our supplication to you, and intercede for us to Jehovah your God, even for all this remnant, (for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes behold us),
that Jehovah your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.
And Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard. Behold, I will pray to Jehovah your God according to your words; and it shall be that all the word Jehovah shall answer, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.
So they said to Jeremiah, Let Jehovah be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do even according to all things which Jehovah your God shall send you to us.
Whether it is good, or whether it is evil, we will obey the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send you; so that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of Jehovah our God.
And it came to pass after ten days that the Word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.
And he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
and said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before Him:
If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and will not pull you down. And I will plant you and will not pluck you up. For I am sorry for you because of the evil that I have brought upon you.
Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not be afraid of him, says Jehovah; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand.
And I will show mercy upon you, so that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.
But if you say, We will not dwell in this land, nor obey the voice of Jehovah your God,
saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the shofar, nor hunger for bread; and there we will dwell;
then now hear the Word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah. Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: If you decide to set your faces to go into Egypt, and go to live there,
then it shall happen that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt. And the famine about which you were anxious shall cling to you there in Egypt; and you shall die there.
So shall it be to all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there. They shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: As My anger and My fury have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My fury be poured forth upon you when you shall enter into Egypt. And you shall be a curse, and a wonder, and a shame, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.
Jehovah has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, Do not go into Egypt. Recognize and acknowledge that I have testified against you this day.
For you used deceit in your hearts when you sent me to Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us to Jehovah our God; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, declare it to us, and we will do it.
And I have declared it to you today; but you have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God, nor anything for which He has sent me unto you.
Now therefore know and recognize that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to live.
And it happened when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the Words of Jehovah their God, for which Jehovah their God had sent him to them, all these Words,
that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, You speak falsely! Jehovah our God has not sent you to say, Do not go to Egypt to live there.
But Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death and to take us captive to Babylon.
So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of Jehovah to live in the land of Judah.
But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the commanders of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations (where they had been driven) to dwell in the land of Judah;
men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every soul that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
So they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of Jehovah. So they came to Tahpanhes.
Then the Word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,
Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick kiln which is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the eyes of the men of Judah.
And say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.
And when he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt. And whoever is for death shall go to death; and whoever for captivity, into captivity; and whoever for the sword, to the sword.
And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt. And he shall burn them and take them captive. And he shall adorn himself with the land of Egypt, like a shepherd puts on his robe; and he shall go out from there in peace.
He shall also break the obelisks of The House of the Sun which are in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.
The Word that came unto Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who live in the land of Egypt, who live in Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. And, behold, today they are a desolation, and no one lives there
because of their evil which they have done to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, to serve other gods whom they knew not, they, you, nor your fathers.
But I sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate!
But they did not heed, nor extend their ear to turn from their evil, to burn no incense to other gods.
Therefore My fury and My anger was poured out, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. And they are wasted and deserted, as it is this day.
Now therefore thus says Jehovah the God of Hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none remaining;
in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live, that you might cut yourselves off and that you might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have done in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
They have not humbled themselves to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in My Law, nor in My statutes which I have set before you and before your fathers.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set My face against you for evil, to cut off all Judah.
And I will take the remnant of Judah, who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there; and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt. They shall be destroyed by the sword and by the famine. They shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be a curse, a wonder, and a shame, and a reproach.
For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence,
so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there shall escape or survive, that they should return into the land of Judah to which they have a desire to return to live there. For no one shall return except those who escape.
And all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great multitude, even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
As for the Word that you have spoken to us in the name of Jehovah, we will not give heed to you.
But we will prepare and do whatever goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our rulers, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and were well-off, and saw no evil.
But since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.
And the women also said, when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven, and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make our cakes in her image, and pour out drink offerings to her without our men?
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying:
The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your rulers, and the people of the land; did not Jehovah remember them, and did it not come into His mind?
Yes, so that Jehovah could no longer hold back because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations which you have done! Therefore your land is a waste, and a wonder, and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is today.
Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against Jehovah, and have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah, nor walked in His Law, nor in His statutes, nor did you walk in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as it is this day.
Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, Hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hands, saying, We will prepare and celebrate our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her. You will arise and carry out your vows, and prepare and celebrate your vows.
Therefore hear the Word of Jehovah, all Judah that lives in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says Jehovah, that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives.
Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good. And all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them.
Yet a small number that escapes the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine or theirs.
And this shall be a sign to you, says Jehovah, that I will punish you in this place, so that you may know that My Words shall be established and confirmed against you for evil.
Thus says Jehovah, Behold, I am giving Pharaoh-hophra, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of those who seek his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy that sought his life.
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
You said, Woe is me now, for Jehovah has added grief to my sorrow. I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
Thus you shall say unto him, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, what I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even all this land.
And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, says Jehovah. But I will give your life to you as a prize in all places wherever you go.
The Word of Jehovah which came unto Jeremiah the prophet against the nations;
against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.
Set in order the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
Harness the horses, and horsemen mount up. Stand with helmets, polish the spears; put on the armor.
Why have I seen them dismayed and turned back? And their mighty ones are beaten down and have fled for refuge, and they do not look back. Terror is all around, says Jehovah.
Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape. They stumbled and fell toward the north, by the River Euphrates.
Who is this rising up like a flood, whose waters move like the rivers?
Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters surge about like the rivers. And he says, I will go up and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots! And let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans who handle the shield, and the Lydians who handle and bend the bow.
For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, a day of vengeance, that He may avenge Himself of His adversaries. And the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood, for the Lord Jehovah of Hosts has a sacrifice in the land of the north by the River Euphrates.
Go up into Gilead and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt. In vain shall you use many medicines; you shall not be cured.
The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land. For the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they have both fallen together.
The Word which Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, of the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to strike the land of Egypt.
Declare it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol, and proclaim it in Noph and in Tahpanhes. Say, Stand fast and get prepared, for the sword shall devour all around you.
Why are your mighty ones swept away? They did not stand, because Jehovah thrust them away.
He made many fall; yea, one fell upon another. And they said, Arise, and let us go back to our own people and to the land of our birth, away from the oppressing sword.
They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the appointed time.
As I live, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so he shall come.
O daughter dwelling in Egypt, prepare yourself to go into captivity. For Noph shall be waste and desolate, without inhabitant.
Egypt is a beautiful heifer, but a stinger comes, it comes from the north.
Also her hired ones are in her midst like calves of the stall; for they also have turned back, fleeing together. They did not stand, because the day of their calamity had come upon them, the time of their punishment.
Their sound goes like a serpent, for they shall go with strength and come against her with axes like those who cut wood.
They shall cut down her forest, says Jehovah, though it cannot be searched; because they are more numerous than the locusts and cannot be counted.
The daughter of Egypt shall be ashamed. She shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, along with their gods and their kings; even Pharaoh and all who trust in him;
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Jehovah.
But do not fear, O My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel. For behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity. And Jacob shall return and have rest and be at ease, and no one shall make him afraid.
Do not fear, O Jacob My servant, says Jehovah, for I am with you. For I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you. But I will not make a complete end of you, but will correct you in justice; and I will not leave you acquitted nor unpunished.
The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land and all its fullness; the city and those who dwell in it. And the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.
At the noise of the stamping of the hooves of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back for their children because of feebleness of hands;
because of the day that comes to plunder all the Philistines and to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every survivor who helps. For Jehovah will plunder the Philistines, the rest of the regions of Caphtor.
Baldness has come upon Gaza. Ashkelon is cut off with the rest of their valley. For how long will you cut yourself off?
O sword of Jehovah, how long will it be until you are quiet? Put yourself into your sheath; rest and be still.
How can it be quiet, since Jehovah has given it a command? He has appointed it there against Ashkelon, and against the seashore.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, against Moab: Woe to Nebo, for it is plundered! Kirjathaim is dried up and captured. The Fortress is dried up and dismayed.
No more praise of Moab. In Heshbon they have plotted evil against it, saying, Come and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also you shall be silenced, O madmen; the sword shall pursue you.
A voice of crying shall be heard from Horonaim, plundering and great destruction.
Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
For at the ascent to Luhith they go up with continual weeping; for at the descent from Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
Flee, save your lives, and be like a bush in the wilderness.
For because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you shall also be captured. And Chemosh shall go into captivity along with his priests and his rulers.
And the robber shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape. Also the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as Jehovah has spoken.
Give wings to Moab so that it may flee and get away; for its cities shall be desolate, without an inhabitant in them.
Cursed is he who does the work of Jehovah deceitfully, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.
Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his dregs and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent has not changed.
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will send ones to lean him, tip him over, and empty his vessels, and shatter his jars.
And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
How can you say, We are mighty and strong men for war?
Moab is plundered and has gone up out of her cities. And his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.
The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries quickly.
All you who are around him, mourn him. And all you who know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken; the beautiful rod!
O daughter dwelling in Dibon, come down from your glory and sit in thirst. For the plunderer of Moab has come upon you; he has destroyed your strongholds.
O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch. Ask him who flees and her who escapes; say, What is happening?
Moab is withered up, and it is broken down. Howl and cry! Tell it in Arnon that Moab is plundered.
And judgment has come upon the plains; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,
and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,
and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Jehovah.
Make him drunk, for he magnified himself against Jehovah. Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be an object of derision.
For was not Israel an object of derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For ever since you spoke of him, you skipped for joy.
O you who dwell in Moab, leave the cities and live in the rock, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the mouth of the cave.
We have heard of the pride of Moab (he is exceedingly proud), his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.
I know his wrath, says Jehovah, but it is not so; his boast, but they have not done it.
Therefore I will wail for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab, and shall mourn for the men of Kir-hares.
O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer. Your plants have gone over the sea; they reach to the sea of Jazer. A plunderer has fallen upon your summer fruits and upon your vintage.
And joy and gladness are taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab. And I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses; no one shall tread the grapes with shouting; no joyous shouting.
From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh, and to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, like a three year old heifer; for the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.
Moreover, I will put an end to him who offers in the high places in Moab, says Jehovah, who burns incense to his gods.
Therefore my heart shall mourn for Moab like flutes, and my heart shall mourn like flutes for the men of Kir-hares, because the riches that he has gotten have perished.
For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped. On all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.
On all the housetops of Moab, and in its streets, there is weeping for all. For I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one has pleasure, says Jehovah.
They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! How has Moab turned the back with shame! Thus Moab shall be an object of derision, and a terror to all those around him.
For thus says Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly like an eagle and shall spread his wings over Moab.
Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized; and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab in that day shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.
And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Jehovah.
Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon you, O inhabitant of Moab, says Jehovah.
He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit; and he who goes up out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their judgment, says Jehovah.
Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon from fatigue, but a fire shall come out from Heshbon, and a flame out of the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the sons of desolation.
Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh perish; for your sons have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.
But I will bring back the captives of Moab in the latter days, says Jehovah. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
Thus says Jehovah to the sons of Ammon: Has Israel no sons? Or has he no heir? Why does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will cause a shout of war to be heard in Rabbah of the sons of Ammon. And it shall be a heap of ruins, and her daughter-villages shall be burned with fire. Then Israel shall take possession of his inheritance, says Jehovah.
Wail, O Heshbon; for Ai is plundered! Cry, daughters of Rabbah; clothe yourselves with sackcloth, mourn, and run to and fro by the hedges! For their king shall go into captivity with his priests and his rulers together.
Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valleys, O backsliding daughter; who trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come against me?
Behold, I will bring a fear upon you, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts, from all those who are around you. And you shall be driven out, each man straight forward; and there shall be no one to gather those who stray.
And afterward I will bring back the captives of the sons of Ammon, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts to Edom: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?
Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan. For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him in the time that I will punish him.
If the gatherers of grapes had come to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves had come by night, would they not destroy until they had enough?
But I have made Esau bare; I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself. His seed is plundered, and his brothers and his neighbors; and he is no more.
Leave your orphans; I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in Me.
For thus says Jehovah: Behold, those whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have surely drunk. And are you pure and innocent? You shall not be exempt from punishment, but you shall surely drink.
For I have sworn by Myself, says Jehovah, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse. And all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.
I have heard a message from Jehovah, and a messenger is sent to the nations, saying, Gather together and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
For lo, I will make you small among the nations, despised among men.
Your dreadfulness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill. Though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Jehovah.
Also Edom shall be an astonishment. Everyone who goes by it shall be appalled and shall hiss at all its plagues.
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says Jehovah, no man shall remain there, nor shall a son of man live in it.
Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the dwelling of the strong. But I will suddenly make him run away from her. And who is a chosen one that I may appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who will summon Me? And who is that shepherd who will stand before Me?
Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah which He has taken against Edom, and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away; surely He shall desolate their dwellings with them.
The earth quakes at the sound of their fall; when they cried, its sound was heard at the Red Sea.
Behold, he shall come up and fly like the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah. And in that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be like the heart of a woman in birth pangs.
Concerning Damascus: Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard bad news. Their hearts have melted; the sea is anxious; it cannot be quiet.
Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee, and trembling has seized her. Anguish and sorrows have taken her like a woman in labor.
How has the city of praise not been deserted, the city of my joy!
Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be silenced in that day, says Jehovah of Hosts.
And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.
Thus says Jehovah concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall strike: Arise, go up to Kedar, and plunder the men of the east.
They shall take away their tents and their flocks. They shall take their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels to themselves. And they shall cry out to them, Fear is on every side!
Flee, go far away, dwell in the depths, O people of Hazor, says Jehovah; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a plan against you.
Arise, go up to the nation that is at ease, that dwells securely, says Jehovah, which has neither gates nor bars, which dwells alone.
And their camels shall be for spoils, and the multitude of their cattle for plunder. And I will scatter them to all the winds, cut off to the farthest extremities. And I will bring their calamity from all sides of it, says Jehovah.
And Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals and a desolation forever. No man shall live there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
The Word of Jehovah that came unto Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.
And I will bring the four winds from the four corners of the heavens upon Elam, and will scatter them toward all these winds. And there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before those who seek their life. And I will bring evil upon them, even My fierce anger, says Jehovah. And I will send the sword after them until I have finished them;
and I will set My throne in Elam, and will destroy the king and the rulers from there, says Jehovah.
But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captives of Elam, says Jehovah.
The Word that Jehovah spoke against Babylon, against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
Declare among the nations, proclaim, and lift up a banner. Proclaim and do not hide it; say, Babylon is captured, Bel is ashamed, Merodach is broken in pieces; her images are withered up, her idols are broken in pieces.
For out of the north a nation comes up against her, which shall make her land a waste, and no one shall dwell in it. They shall flee, they shall depart, both man and beast.
In those days, and at that time, says Jehovah, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping. They shall go and seek Jehovah their God.
They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces headed there, saying, Come and let us join ourselves to Jehovah in an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten.
My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains. They have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.
All who have found them have devoured them. And their enemies said, We have done no wrong, because they have sinned against Jehovah, the habitation of righteousness, even Jehovah, the hope of their fathers.
Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be like the rams before the flocks.
For, lo, I am stirring up and bringing up against Babylon a company of great nations from a northern land. And they shall array themselves against her. She shall be captured there. Their arrows shall be as those of a skillful, mighty man; none shall return in vain.
And Chaldea shall be a spoils; all who plunder her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.
Because you were glad, because you rejoiced, O destroyers of My inheritance; because you are fat like a heifer in lush grass, and bellow like bulls;
your mother shall be deeply ashamed; she who bore you shall be embarrassed. Behold, the last of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land and a desert.
Because of the wrath of Jehovah it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly a waste. Everyone who goes by Babylon shall be horrified and hiss at all her plagues.
Put yourselves in array against Babylon all around; all you who bend the bow, shoot at her, and spare no arrows; for she has sinned against Jehovah.
Shout against her all around. She has given her hand; her foundations have fallen, her walls have been thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Jehovah. Take vengeance on her. As she has done, do unto her.
Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who handles the sickle in the time of harvest. For fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn, each one to his people; and they shall flee, each one to his own land.
Israel is like scattered sheep, driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has crushed his bones.
Therefore thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
And I will bring Israel back to his home, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.
In those days, and at that time, says Jehovah, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and it shall not be found; and the sins of Judah, but they shall not be found; for I will pardon those whom I spare.
Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod. Waste and exterminate after them, says Jehovah, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
How the hammer of the whole earth is chopped off and broken! How Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!
I have laid a trap for you, and you have also been caught, O Babylon, and you did not even know it. You have been found and also captured, because you have fought against Jehovah.
Jehovah has opened His armory, and has brought forth the weapons of His indignation. For this is the work of the Lord Jehovah of Hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
Come against her from the border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her completely. Let nothing of her be left.
Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their punishment.
The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of His temple.
Summon the archers against Babylon. All you who bend the bow, camp against it all around; let none of them escape. Repay her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her. For she has been proud against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore her young men shall fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be silenced in that day, says Jehovah.
Behold, I am against you, O proud ones, says the Lord Jehovah of Hosts; for your day has come, the time that I will judge you.
And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and no one shall raise him up. And I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall consume everything all around him.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together. And all who captured them have held them fast; they have refused to let them go.
Their Redeemer is strong; Jehovah of Hosts, is His name. He shall thoroughly plead their case, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
A sword is upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her rulers, and upon her wise men.
A sword is upon the liars, and they shall become fools. A sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
A sword is upon their horses and their chariots, and upon all the mixed people in her midst; and they shall become as women. A sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.
A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up. For it is the land of graven images, and they act madly and are in dread.
Therefore the beasts of the desert shall dwell there with the howling beasts. And the young owls shall dwell in it. And it shall not again be inhabited forever; it shall not be lived in from generation to generation.
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors, says Jehovah, so no man shall remain there, nor shall any son of man live in it.
Behold, a people shall come from the north, even a great nation; and many kings shall be aroused from the ends of the earth.
They lay hold on the bow and spear; they are cruel and shall not show mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride on horses, set in array like a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon.
The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands became feeble. Anguish has taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in labor.
Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the dwelling of the strong. But I will make them suddenly run away from her. And who is a chosen one whom I may appoint over her? For who is like Me? And who will set My appointments? And who is that shepherd who will face Me?
Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah that He has taken against Babylon; and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely the least of the flock shall drag them; surely He shall make their dwelling desolate to them.
At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth quakes, and a cry is heard among the nations.
Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up a destroying wind against Babylon, and against those dwelling in their midst who rise up against Me.
And I will send strangers into Babylon who shall winnow her and shall empty her land. For in the day of calamity they shall be against her all around.
Do not let the archer tread and bend his bow; nor lift himself up in his armor. And do not spare her young men; utterly destroy all her army.
Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, those thrust through in her streets.
For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken by his God, Jehovah of Hosts, though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.
Flee out of the middle of Babylon, and each man deliver his soul. Do not be cut off in her iniquity, for this is the time of Jehovah’s vengeance; He will make good her recompense.
Babylon has been a golden cup in Jehovah’s hand, which made all the earth drunk. The nations have drunk her wine; therefore the nations are deranged.
Babylon has suddenly fallen and been destroyed. Wail for her; take balm for her pain, if perhaps she may be healed.
We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed. Forsake her and let us go, each one into his own land; for her judgment reaches to the heavens and is lifted up to the skies.
Jehovah has brought forth our righteousness; come and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God.
Polish the arrows; gather the shields. Jehovah has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes. For His plan is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance of His temple.
Set up the banner on the walls of Babylon; make the guard strong; set up the watchmen; prepare the ambushes. For Jehovah has both planned and done that which He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.
O you who live on many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, and the measure of your unjust gain.
Jehovah of Hosts has sworn by Himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men as with locust caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.
He has made the earth by His power; He has established the world by His wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by His understanding.
When He utters His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and He causes the mists to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightnings with rain and brings forth the wind out of His treasures.
Every man is stupid in knowledge; every refiner is put to shame by graven images. For his molten image is deception, and there is no breath in them.
They are vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their judgment they shall perish.
The Portion of Jacob is not like them; for He is the Former of all things, and Israel is the offshoot of His inheritance. Jehovah of Hosts is His name.
You are My battle-ax and weapons of war; for with you I will shatter nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms.
And with you I will shatter the horse and his rider; and with you I will shatter the chariot and his rider.
Also with you I will shatter man and woman; and with you I will shatter old and young; and with you I will shatter the young man and the maiden.
I will also shatter the shepherd and his flock with you. And with you I will shatter the farmer and his yoke of oxen; and with you I will shatter governors and rulers.
And I will recompense unto Babylon, and unto all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all the evil that they have done in Zion in your eyes, says Jehovah.
Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says Jehovah, who destroys all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand upon you and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.
And they shall not take a stone from you for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you shall be a waste forever, says Jehovah.
Set up a banner in the land; blow the shofar among the nations; prepare the nations against her. Call the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz together against her; appoint a commander against her. Cause the horses to come up as the bristling caterpillars.
Consecrate nations against her, with the kings of the Medes, her governors and all her rulers, and all the land of his realm.
And the land shall tremble and writhe. For every purpose of Jehovah shall be fulfilled against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a waste without inhabitant.
The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting; they have remained in strongholds; their might has failed. They became like women; they have burned her dwellings; the bars of her gates are broken.
A runner shall run to meet a runner, and a herald to a herald, to report to the king of Babylon that his city is captured from end to end;
and that the passages are blocked; and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war are frightened.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor, and it is time to thresh her. Yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel. He has swallowed me up like a dragon; he has filled his stomach with my delicacies; he has rinsed me out.
The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, the inhabitant of Zion shall say. And, My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, Jerusalem shall say.
Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.
And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, a horror and a hissing, without inhabitant.
They shall roar together like lions; they shall growl like lions’ cubs.
In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk so that they may rejoice and sleep a never-ending sleep, and not wake up, says Jehovah.
I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with the male goats.
How Sheshach is captured! And how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a waste among the nations!
The sea has come up over Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of its waves.
Her cities are desolate, a dry land and a wilderness, a land in which no man dwells, nor does any son of man pass by it.
And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up. And the nations shall not flow together to him any more; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
My people, go out of her midst; and let each man deliver his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah.
And let not your heart faint, nor fear the rumor that shall be heard in the land. The report shall come in a year. And after that a report shall come in another year; and violence shall be in the land, ruler against ruler.
Therefore, behold, the days are coming that I will punish the graven images of Babylon. And all her land shall be put to shame, and all her slain shall fall in her midst.
And the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, shall shout for joy over Babylon; for the plunderers shall come to her from the north, says Jehovah.
As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.
You who have escaped the sword, go away! Do not stand still! Remember Jehovah from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
We are confounded because we have heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah’s house.
Therefore behold, the days are coming, says Jehovah, that I will punish her graven images, and throughout all her land the wounded shall groan.
Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet plunderers shall come unto her from Me, says Jehovah.
The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,
because Jehovah is plundering Babylon, and the loud voice has been blotted out of her. Her waves are turbulent like great waters, they have made a great roaring sound;
because the plunderer has come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are captured. Every one of their bows is broken, for Jehovah, the Mighty God of recompenses, makes good the recompense.
And I will make her rulers drunk, along with her wise ones, her governors, and her officials, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a never-ending sleep and not wake up, says the King whose name is Jehovah of Hosts.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The broad walls of Babylon shall be completely broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the nation shall labor in vain, and the people shall be in the fire, and they shall be weary.
The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was a quiet leader.
So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you arrive in Babylon, and have seen, and have read all these words,
then you shall say, O Jehovah, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that no one shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be a waste forever.
And it shall be when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.
And you shall say, In this way shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise, from the evil that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
For although the anger of Jehovah was upon Jerusalem and Judah (until He had cast them out from His presence), Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it and built siege walls against it all around.
So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
And in the fourth month, in the ninth of the month, the famine was so severe in the city, so that there was no food for the people of the land.
Then the city was broken into, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. (And the Chaldeans lay in wait all around the city.) And they went by the way of the plain.
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him.
So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he passed judgment against him.
And the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the rulers of Judah in Riblah.
And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah. And the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and brought him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.
And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, (which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem.
And he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house. And he burned with fire all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great ones.
And all the army of the Chaldeans, with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.
And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive some of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people who remained in the city, and those who deserted, who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.
Also the Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in the house of Jehovah, and the bases, and the bronze sea in the house of Jehovah, and carried all the bronze from them to Babylon.
They also took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.
And the captain of the guard took away the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; what was gold, in gold; and what was silver, in silver.
The two pillars, one sea, and twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made in the house of Jehovah; the bronze of all these vessels was without weight.
And concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits. And a measuring line of twelve cubits went around it, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow.
And a capital of bronze was on it. And the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capitals all around, all of bronze. The second pillar also, and the pomegranates, were like these.
And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; all the pomegranates on the network were a hundred all around.
And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.
He also took out of the city an official who was in charge of the men of war; and seven men from those who were close to the king, who were found in the city; and the chief scribe of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of the city.
And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
And the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was taken captive out of his own land.
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he took captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;
in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took captive seven hundred and forty-five persons of the Jews. All the persons were four thousand and six hundred.
And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,
and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon.
And he changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread before him all the days of his life.
And as for his allowance: a continual allowance was given him from the king of Babylon, the matter day by day, until the day of his death, all the days of his life.
How alone sits the city that was full of people! She has become like a widow, who was once great among the nations, a princess among the nations, but now has come under tribute.
She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers, she has no one to comfort her. All her friends have dealt deceitfully with her; they have become her enemies.
Judah went into captivity under affliction and hard labor. She dwells among the nations; she finds no rest; all her pursuers have overtaken her between the straits.
The roads of Zion mourn because none go to the appointed meetings. All her gates are deserted; her priests sigh; her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
Her oppressors have become the chief; her enemies are at ease; for Jehovah has afflicted her for the multitude of her sins. Her children have gone into captivity before the enemy.
And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty has departed. Her rulers have become like deer, who find no pasture, that flee without strength before the pursuer.
In the days of her affliction and her wandering, Jerusalem remembered all her desirable things from ancient days, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy with no one to help her. The enemies saw her; they laughed at her annihilation.
Jerusalem has grievously sinned, therefore she has become impure. All who honored her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; yea, she sighs and turns backward.
Her uncleanness is in her skirts; she did not remember her end, and her downfall was extraordinary. There is no comforter for her. O Jehovah, behold my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself.
The enemy has spread out his hand upon all her desirable things; for she has seen the nations enter her sanctuary, whom You commanded that they should not enter into Your assembly.
All her people sigh; they seek bread. They have given their desirable things for food to restore life. See, O Jehovah, and look upon me, for I have become vile.
Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by? Behold and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow which is done to me, with which Jehovah has afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger.
From above He has sent fire into my bones and it has laid them low. He has spread a net for my feet; He has turned me back; He has made me desolate and faint all the day.
The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand, woven together, and thrust upon my neck. He has made my strength to falter; the Lord has delivered me into their hands. I am not able to rise up.
The Lord has trampled all my mighty ones in my midst; He has called a gathering against me to crush my young men. The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
For these I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter who could refresh my soul is far from me. My children are desolate because the enemy has prevailed.
Zion spreads forth her hands, but no one comforts her. Jehovah has commanded concerning Jacob that his enemies should be all around him; Jerusalem has become as an impure thing among them.
Jehovah is righteous, for I have rebelled against His command. I beseech you, all peoples, hear and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.
I called for my lovers, but they deceived me; my priests and my elders died in the city while they sought food for them to restore their life.
Behold, O Jehovah, for I am in distress; my stomach is upset; my heart churns within me, for I have grievously rebelled. Outside the sword bereaves; at home it is like death.
They hear that I sigh; but no one comforts me. All my enemies have heard of my evil; they are glad that You have done it. You will bring the day that You have called, and they shall be like me.
Let all their wickedness come before You; and do to them as You have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.
How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger! He cast down the beauty of Israel from the heavens to the earth and remembered not His footstool in the day of His anger.
The Lord has swallowed up all the dwelling places of Jacob and has not pitied. In His wrath He has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He has brought them down to the ground. He has defiled the kingdom and its rulers.
He has cut off all the horn of Israel in His fierce anger; He has drawn back His right hand from before the enemy, and He burned against Jacob like flaming fire which devours all around.
He has bent His bow like an enemy; He stood with His right hand like an adversary, and killed all who were desirable to the eye in the tent of the daughter of Zion. He has poured out His fury like fire.
The Lord was like an enemy; He has swallowed up Israel; He has swallowed up all her palaces, and destroyed His strongholds. And He has increased mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.
And He has done violence to His pavilion like it were a garden, and has destroyed His meeting places. Jehovah has caused the appointed meetings and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and He has despised the king and the priest in the indignation of His anger.
The Lord has cast off His altar; He has abhorred His sanctuary; He has given up the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have made a sound in the house of Jehovah, as in the day of the appointed meetings.
Jehovah has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion; He has stretched out a line; He has not withdrawn His hand from devouring, and He made rampart and wall lament; they languish together.
Her gates have sunk into the ground; He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her rulers are among the nations. The law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah.
The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and are silent; they throw dust on their heads; they gird on sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
My eyes fail with tears; my stomach is upset; my liver is poured on the ground for the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the children and the babies faint in the streets of the city.
They say to their mothers, Where are grain and wine? When they faint they are like the wounded in the streets of the city, pouring out their lives into their mothers’ bosoms.
What can I testify for you? To what thing shall I compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem? To what shall I equal you, so that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For your break is great like the sea! Who can heal you?
Your prophets have seen vain and foolish things for you, and they have not uncovered your iniquity, to bring back your captives; but they have seen false utterances and causes of banishment for you.
All who pass by clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city which is called the perfection of beauty, the joy of the whole earth?
All your enemies have opened their mouth against you; they hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up. Certainly this is the day that we waited for. We have found it, we have seen it.
Jehovah has done what He had purposed; He has fulfilled His Word which He commanded in the days of old. He has thrown down and not pitied. And He has caused your enemy to rejoice over you; He has set up the horn of your foes.
Their heart cried unto the Lord. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night; give yourself no rest. Let not the daughter of your eye be silent.
Arise, cry out in the night. At the beginning of the watches, pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up your hands toward Him for the life of your children who faint from hunger at the head of every street.
Behold, O Jehovah, and consider to whom You have done this. Shall the women eat their offspring, children of their tender care? Shall the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord?
Young and old lie on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. You have killed them in the day of Your anger; You have slaughtered and not pitied.
You have summoned, as in an appointed day, my terrors all around; and there was not one who escaped, or a survivor in the day of Jehovah’s anger. Those whom I have nursed and nurtured, my enemy has consumed.
I, the man, have seen affliction by the rod of His wrath.
He has led me and made me go in darkness and not in light.
Surely He is turned against me; He turns His hand all the day.
He has wasted my flesh and my skin; He has broken my bones.
He has built against me and has encircled me with bitterness and travail.
He has made me live in dark places, like the dead of old.
He has fenced me in and I cannot go out; He has made my bronze chain heavy.
Also when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.
He walled up my ways with hewn stone; my paths are crooked.
He was a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in secret places.
He has turned my ways aside and torn me in pieces. He has made me desolate.
He has bent His bow and set me as a target for the arrow.
He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my inward parts.
I was a laughing stock to all my people; their taunting song all the day.
He has filled me with bitterness and made me drunk with wormwood.
He also broke my teeth with gravel; He has covered me with ashes.
And You cast off my soul from peace; I have forgotten good things.
And I said, My strength and my hope from Jehovah are gone.
Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness.
My soul calls to mind and remembers, and it depresses my mind.
I recall this to my mind; therefore I hope.
Through Jehovah’s kindness we are not consumed, because His compassions never fail.
They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness.
Jehovah is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in Him.
Jehovah is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.
It is good that one should hope for the salvation of Jehovah, even in silence.
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
He sits alone and keeps silence because He has laid it upon him.
He puts his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there may be hope.
He gives his cheek to Him who strikes him; he is filled full with reproach.
For the Lord will not cast off forever;
for though He causes grief, yet He will have compassion according to the multitude of His kindness.
For He does not wish to afflict nor grieve the sons of men;
to crush all the prisoners of the earth under His feet;
to turn aside the justice due a man before the face of the Most High;
to pervert a man in his cause; this the Lord does not look after.
Who is he who speaks and it occurs, if the Lord has not commanded it?
From the mouth of the Most High does not come forth both evil and good.
Why does a living man complain at the punishment for his sins?
Let us search out and examine our ways, and return to Jehovah.
Let us lift up our heart and hands to the Mighty God in Heaven.
We have sinned and have rebelled; You have not forgiven.
You have wrapped Yourself with anger and pursued us; You have slain; You have not spared.
You have wrapped Yourself with a cloud to keep prayer from passing through.
You have made us as the offscouring and garbage in the midst of the peoples.
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
Fear and a pit have come upon us; ruin and destruction.
Streams of water run down my eyes for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
My eyes flow and do not cease, with no stopping,
until Jehovah looks down from Heaven and has regard.
My eye pains my soul because of all the daughters of my city.
My enemies have hunted me down like a bird, without cause.
They have cut off my life in the pit, and cast a stone upon me.
Waters flowed over my head; then I said, I am cut off.
I called on Your name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest pit.
You have heard my voice; do not hide Your ear from my relief, from my cry for help.
You drew near in the day that I called on You; You said, Fear not.
O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul; You have redeemed my life.
O Jehovah, You have seen how I am wronged; judge my case.
You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me.
You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their plots against me;
the lips of those who rose up against me, and their scheming against me all the day.
Behold their sitting down and their rising up; I am their taunting song.
Return upon them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.
Give them hardness of heart; Your curse be upon them.
Pursue and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of Jehovah.
How the gold has become dim; the fine gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
The precious sons of Zion, weighed against refined gold, are counted as earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter!
Even the monsters draw out the breast to suckle their young. But the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
The tongue of the infant cleaves to the roof of his mouth in thirst; the young children ask for bread; there is none broken to them.
Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets; those brought up in scarlet embrace refuse heaps.
For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, with no hands to writhe over her.
Her Nazirites were purer than snow, whiter than milk; they were redder of body than rubies; their polishing as sapphires.
Their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it is dried up; it has become like wood.
Better off are the ones slain by the sword than the ones slain by hunger; for they pine away, pierced through for lack of the fruits of the fields.
The hands of the compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
Jehovah has fulfilled His fury; He has poured out His fierce anger, and has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has devoured its foundations.
The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy would have entered the gates into Jerusalem.
For the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, shedding the blood of the just in her midst,
they have wandered as blind men in the streets; they are defiled with blood, so that no one could touch their clothes.
They cried out to them, Depart! Unclean! Depart, depart! Do not touch us! When they fled and wandered, they said among the nations, They will not continue to live there.
The face of Jehovah has scattered them out; He will no longer have regard for them; they did not respect the persons of the priests, nor show favor to the elders.
As for us, our eyes failed, watching in vain for our help; in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.
They have hunted our steps to keep us from going in our streets; our end was near, our days were fulfilled, for our end has come.
Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens; they pursued us on the mountains, they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was captured in their pits; of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, who lives in the land of Uz. The cup also shall pass through unto you; you shall become drunk and stripped naked.
The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; He will send you into captivity no more. He will punish your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins.
Remember, O Jehovah, what has come upon us; look down and behold our reproach.
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers; our houses to foreigners.
We are orphans and fatherless; our mothers are as widows.
We have drunk our water for money; our wood comes at a price.
We are pursued on our necks; we labor and have no rest.
We have given the hand to Egypt, to Assyria, to be satisfied with bread.
Our fathers have sinned and are no more; but we have borne their iniquities.
Servants rule over us; there is no one to deliver out of their hand.
We bring in our bread at the risk of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.
Our skin is hot like an oven because of the burning heat of famine.
They raped the women in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.
Rulers were hung up by the hand; the presence of elders was not honored.
They took the young men to grind, and the youths stumbled under loads of wood.
The elders have ceased gathering at the gate, the young men from their music.
The joy of our heart has ceased; our dance has turned into mourning.
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe unto us, for we have sinned.
Our heart is faint because of this; our eyes are dim because of these things.
The mountain of Zion is laid waste; the foxes walk upon it.
You, O Jehovah, remain forever; Your throne from generation to generation.
Why do You forget us forever and forsake us for such a long time?
Turn us back to You, O Jehovah, and we will repent; renew our days as of old,
unless You have utterly rejected us. You have been very angry against us.
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the River Chebar, that the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God.
On the fifth day of the month, which was in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,
the Word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the River Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was upon him there.
And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind was coming out of the north, a great cloud with flashing fire in it; and brightness was all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
Also from within it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.
Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.
Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.
And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.
Their wings joined one to another. They did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.
As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.
Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.
And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit was to go, and they did not turn when they went.
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
And the living creatures were running and returning, in appearance like a flash of lightning.
Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside the living creatures with its four faces.
The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workmanship was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not change directions as they went.
As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.
When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went, where the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up alongside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
The likeness of the expanse above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out above over their heads.
And under the expanse their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of their bodies.
When they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the sound of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.
And there was a voice from the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.
And above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.
Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.
As the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.
And He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.
Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speak to me.
And He said to me: Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day.
For they are impudent and hardhearted children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah.
As for them, whether they hear or whether they forbear; for they are a rebellious house; yet they will know that a prophet has been among them.
And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
You shall speak My Words to them, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.
But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.
And when I looked, behold, there was a hand stretched out to me; and lo, a scroll of a book was in it.
And He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
Moreover He said to me, Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.
So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat the scroll.
And He said to me, Son of man, feed your belly, and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you. So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey for sweetness.
Then He said to me: Son of man, Go. Come to the house of Israel and speak My Words to them.
For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel,
not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
Moreover He said to me: Son of man, receive into your heart all My Words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.
And go! Come to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: Blessed is the glory of Jehovah from His place!
I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, and a great thunderous sound.
So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.
Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there in shock among them seven days.
Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the Word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:
When I say to the wicked, You shall die the death, and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.
Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.
Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall live life because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.
And the hand of Jehovah was upon me there, and He said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will talk with you.
So I arose and went forth into the plain. And behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
Then the Spirit entered into me and stood me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house.
But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put ropes on you and bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.
And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one rebuking them, for they are a rebellious house.
But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.
You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, Jerusalem.
And lay siege against it, build a siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around.
Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it as an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.
Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.
For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.
Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.
And surely I will put bands on you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have completed the days of your siege.
Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself, according to the number of days that you lie on your side; three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.
And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.
You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink.
And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using dung of human excrement, in their eyes.
And Jehovah said, Even so shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.
So I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has never been defiled from my youth till now; I have never eaten a carcass or a torn animal, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.
Then He said to me, See, I am giving you cow manure instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread over it.
Moreover He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will cut off the food supply in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and in horror,
that they may lack bread and water, and be appalled with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.
And you, son of man, take a sharp knife, a barber’s razor, take it to yourself and pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales to weigh and divide the hair.
You shall burn with fire one-third in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are finished; then you shall take one-third and strike around it with the sword, and one-third you shall scatter into the wind: and I will draw out a sword after them.
You shall also take a small number of them and bind them in the edge of your garment.
Then take some of them again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations and the lands all around her.
And she has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the lands that are all around her; for they have rejected My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have multiplied disobedience more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that are all around you;
therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the eyes of the nations.
And I will do in you what I have never done, and the likes of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.
Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.
Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity.
A third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and a third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter the other third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.
Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you, in the eyes of all who pass by.
So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a chastening, and a horror to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in furious punishment. I, Jehovah, have spoken.
When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your food supply.
Thus I will send against you famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: Behold I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.
And your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.
In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and found guilty, your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works blotted out.
And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the earth.
And those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and by their eyes which go whoring after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they did in all their abominations.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hands and stamp with your feet, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.
He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them.
Then you shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered soothing aromas to all their idols.
Thus I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
And you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.
Now the end has come upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.
My eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will repay your ways, and your abominations will be in your midst; then you shall know that I am Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: An evil! An only evil! Behold, it has come!
An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you; behold, it has come!
Morning has come to you, you who dwell in the land; the time has come, a day of trouble is near, and not a shout of rejoicing in the mountains.
Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, and spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.
My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, and your abominations that are in your midst. And you shall know that I am Jehovah who strikes.
Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Morning has gone forth; the staff has blossomed, pride has budded.
Violence has risen up into a staff of wickedness; none of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their abundance, nor any eminent among them.
The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.
For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, though he may still be alive (for the vision concerns the whole multitude, and shall not change); no one will strengthen himself who lives in iniquity.
They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, but no one goes to battle; for My wrath is on all their multitude.
The sword is outside, and the pestilence and famine within. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.
Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.
Every hand will be feeble, and every knee will be as weak as water.
They will also be girded with sackcloth; trembling will cover them; shame will be on every face, and baldness on all their heads.
They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be like filthiness; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah; they will not satisfy their souls, nor fill their stomachs, because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.
As for the beauty of His ornaments, He set it in majesty; but they made from it the images of their abominations; their detestable things; therefore I have made it like refuse to them.
And I will give it as plunder into the hands of strangers, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they shall defile it.
I will turn My face from them, and they will defile My secret place; for violent ones shall enter it and defile it.
Make a chain, for the land is filled with bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.
Therefore I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they will possess their houses; I will bring an end to the pomp of the strong, and their holy places shall be defiled.
Destruction comes! They will seek peace, but there shall be none.
Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; but the Law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be terrified. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgment I will punish them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah!
And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, that the hand of the Lord Jehovah fell upon me there.
Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire; from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, like the color of amber.
And He stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.
Then He said to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, toward the north at the gate of the altar, was this image of jealousy at the entrance.
Furthermore He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.
So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
Then He said to me, Son of man, dig into the wall; and when I dug into the wall, there was an opening.
And He said to me, Go in, and see the evil abominations which they do there.
So I went in and saw; and behold, every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, carved all around on the wall.
And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.
Then He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, Jehovah does not see us, Jehovah has forsaken the land.
And He said to me, Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.
So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the house of Jehovah; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.
Then He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.
So He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down to the sun toward the east.
And He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.
Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.
Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each with his destroying weapon in his hand.
And, behold, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his shattering weapon in his hand. One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
And the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the house. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn at his side;
and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.
To the others He said in my hearing, Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have pity.
Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary. So they began with the elders who were before the house.
Then He said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth! And they went out and killed in the city.
So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left alone; and I fell on my face and cried out, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?
Then He said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is full of perversity; for they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land; and, Jehovah does not see!
And as for Me also, My eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, but I will recompense their deeds upon their own head.
And behold, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, I have done as You commanded me.
And I looked, and there in the expanse that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in before my eyes.
Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
Then the glory of Jehovah went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.
And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.
And it happened, when He had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim, that he went in and stood beside the wheels.
And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.
And under the cherubim’s wings appeared the form of a man’s hand.
And when I looked, behold, four wheels were beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.
As for their appearance, all four had one likeness; as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside as they went.
And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around.
As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Rolling Wheel.
And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature that I saw by the River Chebar.
And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels themselves did not turn from beside them.
When they stood still, these stood still; and when they rose up, these rose up; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.
Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.
And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.
This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.
Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance, even theirs. They each went straight forward.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the house of Jehovah, which faces eastward; and there at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.
And He said to me: Son of man, these are the men who devise wickedness and give evil advice in this city,
who say, The time is not near; let us build houses. This city is the kettle, and we are the flesh.
Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!
And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and said to me, Speak! Thus says Jehovah: Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the thoughts that come into your mind.
You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the flesh, and this city is the kettle; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it.
You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments against you.
You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you to the borders of Israel. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
This city shall not be your kettle, nor shall you be the flesh in its midst. I will judge you in the borders of Israel.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the nations which are all around you.
And it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Go far away from Jehovah; this land has been given to us as a possession.
Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them throughout the earth, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the lands where they have gone.
Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the lands where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
And they will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.
And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,
that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.
Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.
And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city.
Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.
So I spoke to those of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shown me.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.
Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for exile, and go into exile by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into exile to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity.
Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through it.
In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.
So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight.
And in the morning the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?
Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.
Say, I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.
And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes.
I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.
And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.
And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.
But I will leave of them a number of men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations wherever they go. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.
And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.
Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel, which says, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?
Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.
For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
For I, Jehovah, speak, and the Word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be drawn out. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times afar off.
Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: None of My words will be drawn out any more, but the word which I speak will be done, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
O Israel, your prophets are like foxes in the deserts.
You have not gone up into the gaps, nor built a wall for the house of Israel to stand in battle in the day of Jehovah.
They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, Jehovah declares! But Jehovah has not sent them; yet they hope that their word may be confirmed.
Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination? You say, Jehovah declares; though I have not spoken.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And My hand will be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine lies; they shall not be in the council of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, Peace! when there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and plasters it with whitewash.
Say to those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall break it down.
Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.
Thus I will break down the wall you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it;
that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,
and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women who sew amulets on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and save the souls alive to yourselves?
And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, executing souls that should not die, and keeping alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your amulets by which you hunt souls to make them fly. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt to make them fly.
I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not pained; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to restore his life.
Therefore you shall no longer see vanity nor divine divinations; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Then some of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I be inquired of at all by them?
Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Everyone of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart, and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and then comes to the prophet, I, Jehovah will answer him who comes, according to the multitude of his idols,
that I may catch the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from Me through their idols.
Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Repent, turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations.
For anyone of the house of Israel, or of the stranger who sojourns in Israel, who separates himself from Me and sets up his idols in his heart and puts before his face the stumbling block of his iniquity, and comes to a prophet to inquire of him concerning Me, I Jehovah will answer him by Myself.
I will set My face against that man and make him desolate as a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
And if the prophet is induced to speak anything, I Jehovah have induced that prophet, and I will stretch out My hand against him and destroy him from the midst of My people Israel.
And they shall bear their iniquity; the punishment of the prophet shall be the same as the punishment of the one who inquired,
that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, nor be defiled anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be My people and I may be their God, says the Lord Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came again to me, saying:
Son of man, when a land sins against Me by acting treacherously unfaithfully, I will stretch out My hand against it; I will cut off its supply of food, send famine on it, and cut off man and beast from it.
And although these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord Jehovah.
If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they bereave it, and make it so desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts,
although these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; only they would be delivered, and the land would be desolate.
Or if I bring a sword on that land, and say, Sword, go through the land, and I cut off man and beast from it,
although these three men were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but only they themselves would be delivered.
Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out My fury on it in blood, and cut off from it man and beast,
although Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: How much more shall it be when I send My four severe judgments on Jerusalem; the sword and famine and wild beasts and pestilence; to cut off man and beast from it!
Yet behold, there shall be left in it a remnant who will be brought out, both sons and daughters; surely they will come out to you, and you will see their ways and their doings. Then you will be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, all that I have brought upon it.
And they will comfort you when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have done nothing without cause, all that I have done in it, says the Lord Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, how is the wood of the vine, the vine branch, better than any other wood which is among the trees of the forest?
Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can men make a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?
Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?
Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set My face against them.
And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously unfaithfully, says the Lord Jehovah.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,
and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are from the land of Canaan; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.
As for your birth, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths.
No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, for you yourself were loathed on the day you were born.
And when I passed by you and saw you squirming in your blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!
I have made you a multitude, like a plant in the field; and you grew, became great, bedecked with ornaments. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.
When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood, and I anointed you with oil.
I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.
I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.
And I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.
Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.
Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed upon you, declares the Lord Jehovah.
But you trusted in your own beauty, committed adultery because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.
You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and committed adultery on them. Such things should not happen, nor be.
You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and committed adultery with them.
And you took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.
Also My food which I gave you; the fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you; you set it before them as a soothing aroma; and so it was, says the Lord Jehovah.
Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,
that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?
And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, squirming in your blood.
And so it was, after all your wickedness (Woe, woe unto you! declares the Lord Jehovah);
that you also built for yourself a mound, and made a high place for yourself in every open place.
You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.
You also committed adultery with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.
Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your licentious ways.
You also committed adultery with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you committed adultery with them and still were not satisfied.
Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry in the land of Canaan, as far as Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.
How weak is your heart! declares the Lord Jehovah, seeing you do all these things; the deeds of a domineering woman of prostitution.
You build your mound at the head of every road, and built your high place in every open place. Yet you were not like a prostitute, in that you scorned payment.
You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband.
Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.
You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a prostitute. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.
Now then, O prostitute! Hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,
surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.
And I will judge you as women who commit adultery or who shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.
I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your mounds and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.
They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones and cut you with their swords.
And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will put an end to your harlotry, and you shall no longer hire lovers.
So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.
Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds upon your own head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit licentiousness in addition to all your abominations.
Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: Like mother, like daughter!
You are your mother’s daughter, loathing her husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
And your older sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters.
Yet you did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.
As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.
Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.
Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.
You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because your sins were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.
When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them,
so that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did, since you comforted them.
When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.
For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,
before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you from all around.
You have paid for your licentiousness and your abominations, declares Jehovah.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.
Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.
Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.
And I will establish My covenant with you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah,
so that you may remember and be ashamed. And you will never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide atonement for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,
and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: A great eagle with large wings and long pinions, full of feathers of various colors, came to Lebanon and took the highest branch from the cedar.
He cropped off its topmost young twig and carried it to a land of trade; he set it in a city of merchants.
Then he took some of the seed of the land and planted it in a fertile field; he placed it by abundant waters and set it like a willow tree.
And it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature; its branches turned toward him, and its roots were under him. So it became a vine, brought forth branches, and put forth shoots.
There was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and stretched its branches toward him, away from the garden terrace where it had been planted, that he might water it.
It was planted in good soil by many waters, to bring forth branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic vine.
Say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, cut off its fruit, and leave it to wither? All of its sprouting leaves will wither, and no great power or many people will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.
Behold, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the garden terrace where it sprouted.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and rulers, and led them with him to Babylon.
And he has taken the king’s seed, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also has taken away the mighty of the land,
that the kingdom might be low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by the keeping of his covenant it might stand.
But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?
As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, there he shall die with him in the midst of Babylon.
Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.
Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense upon his own head.
And I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and judge him there for the treason by which he betrayed Me.
And all his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to every wind. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will take also one of the highest branches of the high cedar and set it out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. And under it will dwell birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell.
And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are dull?
As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel.
Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine; the soul who sins shall die.
But if a man is righteous and does what is just and right;
if he has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiled his neighbor’s wife, nor approached a menstruating woman;
if he has not oppressed anyone, but has restored to the debtor his pledge; has plundered no one by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing;
if he has not given with usury nor taken any increase, but has withdrawn his hand from iniquity and executed true judgment between man and man;
if he has walked in My statutes and kept My judgments faithfully; he is righteous. He shall live life, says the Lord Jehovah.
If he begets a son who is a robber or who sheds blood, who does any of these things,
and does none of those duties, but has eaten on the mountains or defiled his neighbor’s wife;
if he has oppressed the poor and needy, plundered by robbery, not restored the pledge, has lifted his eyes to the idols, or committed abomination;
if he has exacted usury or taken increase; shall he then live? He shall not live! If he has done any of these abominations, he shall die the death; his blood shall be upon him.
If, however, he begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and considers but does not do likewise;
who has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiled his neighbor’s wife;
has not oppressed anyone, nor withheld a pledge, nor plundered by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing;
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor and not received usury or increase, but has executed My judgments and walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall live life!
As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, plundered his brother by robbery, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.
Yet you say, Why? Does not the son bear the guilt of the father? When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has kept all My statutes and done them, he shall live life.
The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.
But if a wicked man turns from all his sins which he has done, keeps all My statutes, and does what is lawful and right, he shall live life; he shall not die.
None of the transgressions which he has done shall be remembered against him; because of the righteousness which he has done, he shall live.
Do I delight with pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Jehovah, and not that he should turn back from his ways and live?
But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All the righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; because of the treachery of his unfaithfulness, and the sin which he has sinned, in them he shall die.
Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel, is it not My way which is fair, and your ways which are not fair.
When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, commits iniquity, and dies in it, it is for the iniquity which he has done that he dies.
Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he has done, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive.
Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he has done, he shall live life; he shall not die.
Yet the house of Israel says, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, is it not My ways which are fair, and your ways which are not fair.
Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord Jehovah. Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity shall not be a stumbling block to you.
Cast away from you all the transgressions by which you have transgressed, and prepare for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will you die, O house of Israel?
For I have no pleasure in the death of one who dies, declares the Lord Jehovah. Therefore turn and live!
Moreover take up a lamentation for the rulers of Israel,
and say: What is your mother? A lioness: she lay down among the lions; among the young lions she nourished her cubs.
She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion; he learned to catch prey, and he devoured men.
The nations also heard of him; he was trapped in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.
When she saw that she waited, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.
He went around among the lions, and became a young lion; he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
He knew their desolate places, and laid waste their cities; the land with its fullness was desolated by the sound of his roaring.
Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, and spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.
They put him in a cage with chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him in hunting nets, so that his voice should no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters, fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.
She had strong branches for the scepters of rulers. She towered in stature above the thick branches, and was seen in her height amid the abundance of her branches.
But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong branches were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.
And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
Fire has gone out from a staff of her branches and devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong staff; a scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.
It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that certain men of the elders of Israel came to inquire of Jehovah, and sat before me.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Have you come to inquire of Me? As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.
And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand and swore to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God.
On that day I raised My hand and swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth.
Then I said to them, Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.
But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not, each man, cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.
And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them.
Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah who sets them apart.
But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
So I also raised My hand and swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth,
because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.
Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.
But I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.
I am Jehovah your God. Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them;
set apart My Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.
Nevertheless, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and did not keep My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.
Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.
And I raised My hand and swore to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth,
because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes followed after their fathers’ idols.
Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they could not live;
and I defiled them by their gifts, in that they caused all that open the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.
Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being treacherously unfaithful to Me.
For when I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand and sworn to give it to them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.
Then I said to them, What is this high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah to this day.
Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing adultery with their abominations?
For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.
What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, We will be like the nations, like the families in other lands, serving wood and stone.
As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.
And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.
Just as I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.
I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;
I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they dwell, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And you will know that I am Jehovah.
As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go, serve every one of you his idols, even hereafter, if you will not obey me. But profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols.
For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things.
I will accept you as a soothing aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers.
And there you shall remember your ways and all your evil deeds with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have done.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for My name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Furthermore the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face toward the south; drop a word toward the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,
and say to the forest of the South, Hear the Word of Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it.
All flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.
Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! They say of me, Does he not speak parables?
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, drop a word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel;
and say to the land of Israel, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw My sword out of its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked from you, therefore My sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north,
that all flesh may know that I, Jehovah, have drawn My sword out of its sheath; it shall not return anymore.
Sigh therefore, son of man, with a breaking heart, and groan with bitterness before their eyes.
And it shall be when they say to you, Why are you sighing? that you shall answer, Because of the news; when it comes, every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah! Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished!
It is sharpened to slaughter and butcher, polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, as every tree.
And He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened, and it is polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.
Cry and howl, son of man; for it will be against My people, against all the rulers of Israel. The sword will be thrown against My people; therefore slap your thigh,
because it is a testing. And what if the sword despises even the scepter? It shall be no more, declares the Lord Jehovah.
You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand; strike. The third time let the sword be doubled. It is the sword that slays, the sword that slays the great men, that surrounds them.
I have set the slaughter of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! It is made bright; it is grasped for the slaughter:
Be sharp to the right! Set yourself to the left; wherever your face is appointed!
I also will strike My hand to hand, and I will cause My fury to rest; I, Jehovah, have spoken.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying:
And you, son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city.
Appoint a road for the sword to go into Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.
For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the head of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.
In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a mound, and to build a siege wall.
And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.
Now to you, O slain, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end,
thus says the Lord Jehovah: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; nothing shall remain as it was. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.
Ruin, ruin! I will ruin it! It shall be no more, until He comes whose right it is. And I will give it to Him.
And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for slaughter, for consuming, for flashing;
while they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie to you, to bring you upon the necks of the slain, the wicked whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end.
Return it to its sheath. I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your birth.
And I will pour out My indignation upon you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, and deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skilled in destruction.
You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall not be remembered, for I, Jehovah, have spoken.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations!
Then say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The city sheds blood in her midst, that her time may come. And she makes idols within herself to defile herself.
You are guilty by the blood which you have shed, and have defiled yourself with the idols which you have made. You have caused your days to draw near, and have come to your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all lands.
Those who are near and those far from you will mock you as defiled of name and full of confusion.
Behold, the rulers of Israel: each one was in you by his power to shed blood in you.
In you they have made light of father and mother; in your midst they have oppressed the sojourner; in you they have mistreated the orphan and the widow.
You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.
In you are men who slander to cause bloodshed; in you they eat on the mountains; in your midst they commit lewdness.
In you men uncover the nakedness of their fathers; in you they humble women during their menstrual impurity.
One commits abomination with his neighbor’s wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; and another in you humbles his sister, his father’s daughter.
In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take usury and increase; you have made profit from your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Behold, therefore, I have clapped My hands at the unjust gain which you have made, and at the blood which has been in your midst.
Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong, in the days when I shall deal with you? I, Jehovah, have spoken, and will do it.
I will scatter you among the nations, disperse you throughout the earth, and destroy your filthiness out of you.
You shall defile yourself in the eyes of the nations; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; they are all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are the dross of silver.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the midst of the furnace, to blow fire on it to melt it; so I will gather you in My anger and in My fury, and I will leave you there and melt you.
Yes, I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst.
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be melted in its midst. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have poured out My fury upon you.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, say to her: You are a land that is not cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation.
The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst.
Her priests have violated My Law and defiled My holy things; they have not divided between the holy and profane, nor have they declared between the unclean and the clean; and they have hidden their eyes from My Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
Her rulers in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, and to get dishonest gain.
Her prophets plastered them with whitewash, seeing vain visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.
The people of the land have used oppressions, committed robbery, and mistreated the poor and needy; and they wrongfully oppress the sojourner.
So I sought for a man among them who would close up the wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one.
Therefore I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; and I have recompensed their deeds upon their own heads, declares the Lord Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying:
Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.
They committed harlotry in Egypt, they committed harlotry in their youth; their breasts were handled, their virgin nipples were fondled.
Their names: Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister; they were Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.
Oholah committed adultery even though she was Mine; and she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,
who were clothed in purple, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.
Thus she committed her adultery with them, all of them choice men of Assyria; and with all for whom she lusted, with all their idols, she defiled herself.
She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt, for in her youth they had lain with her, fondled her virgin breasts, and poured out their immorality upon her.
Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.
They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword; she became a byword among women, for they had executed judgment on her.
Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry, more than her sister’s harlotry.
She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, captains and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.
Then I saw that she was defiled; both the same way.
But she added to her harlotry; she looked at men portrayed on the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
girded with waistbands around their waists, flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, in the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth.
As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their immorality; so she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.
So she uncovered her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then My soul was alienated from her, just as My soul was alienated from her sister.
Yet she multiplied her harlotry in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had committed adultery in the land of Egypt.
For she lusted for her paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples because of your youthful breasts.
Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:
The Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.
And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, with a company of people. They shall array against you buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will entrust judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.
I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you; they shall remove your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword; they shall take your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by fire.
They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewelry.
Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul is alienated.
They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your adultery shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry.
I will do these things to you because you have gone whoring after the nations, because you have become defiled by their idols.
You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup into your hand.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sister’s cup, deep and wide; you shall be laughed to scorn and held in derision; for it contains much.
You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.
You shall drink and drain it, you shall break its shards, and tear off your own breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore you shall bear the penalty of your lewdness and your harlotry.
Jehovah also said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.
For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them.
Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.
For after they had slain their children to their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.
Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.
You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.
And the sound of a multitude at ease was with her, and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.
Then I said concerning her who was worn out in adulteries, Will they commit adultery with her now, and she with them?
Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman of harlotry; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.
And righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to terror and plunder.
And the company shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.
Thus I will bring an end to lewdness from the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.
And they shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, write down the name of the day, this very day; the king of Babylon has leaned against Jerusalem this very day.
And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Put on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it.
Gather pieces of meat into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder. Fill it with choice cuts;
take the choice of the flock. Also pile bones under it, boil it to boiling, and let the cuts simmer in it.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece. Let no lot fall on it.
For her blood is in her midst; she set it on top of a rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.
That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, that it may not be covered.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.
Heap on the wood, kindle the fire; cook the flesh well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned.
Then set the pot empty on the coals, that it may become hot and its bronze may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, that its scum may be consumed.
She has grown weary with toil, and her great scum has not gone from her. Let her scum be in the fire!
In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.
I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not hold back, nor will I spare, nor will I have compassion; according to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Also the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.
Groan in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the bread of men of sorrow.
So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and in the morning I did as I was commanded.
And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?
Then I answered them, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.
And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your mustaches nor eat the bread of men of sorrow.
Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and mourn with one another.
Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
And you, son of man; will it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their hearts, their sons and their daughters.
On that day one who escapes will come to you to cause you to hear it with your ears;
on that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you shall speak and no longer be mute. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them.
Say to the Ammonites, Hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you said, Aha! against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,
behold, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.
And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you clapped your hands, stamped your feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your contempt for the land of Israel,
behold, therefore, I will stretch out My hand against you, and give you as plunder to the nations; I will cut you off from the peoples, and I will cause you to perish from the earth; I will destroy you, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because Moab and Seir say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the nations,
therefore, behold, I will clear the territory of Moab of cities, of the cities on its borders, the glory of the land, Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kirjathaim.
To the men of the East I will give it as a possession, along with the Ammonites, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because of what Edom did against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has become very guilty from avenging itself on them,
therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also stretch out My hand against Edom, cut off man and beast from it, and make it desolate. From Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword.
I will lay My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, that they may do in Edom according to My anger and according to My fury; and they shall know My vengeance, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because the Philistines dealt with vengeance and took vengeance with spite in their heart, to destroy because of the old hatred,
therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the seacoast.
I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I lay My vengeance upon them.
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, because Tyre has said against Jerusalem, Aha! She is broken who was the gateway of the peoples; now she is turned over to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.
And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like a shiny rock.
It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah; it shall become plunder for the nations.
And her daughters who are in the fields shall be slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company of many people.
He will slay your daughters with the sword in the fields; he will heap up a mound against you, build a siege wall against you, and raise a shield against you.
He will set his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.
Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the sound of the horsemen, the wheels, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached.
With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.
And they will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will put your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water.
And I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more.
And I will make you like a shiny rock, you shall be a place for the spreading of nets, and you shall never be rebuilt; for I, Jehovah, have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Will the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is slain in your midst?
Then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their thrones, lay aside their robes, and take off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.
And they will take up a lamentation for you, and say to you: How you have perished, O one inhabited by seafaring men, O renowned city, who was strong at sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all her inhabitants!
Now the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands by the sea shall be troubled at your departure.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I make you a desolate city, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring the deep upon you, and great waters cover you,
then I will bring you down with those who descend into the Pit, with the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lowest part of the earth, in places desolate from antiquity, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you may never be inhabited; and I shall establish glory in the land of the living.
I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more; though you are sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came again unto me, saying,
Now, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre,
and say to Tyre, You who are situated at the entrance of the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coastlands, thus says the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, you have said, I am perfect in beauty.
Your borders are in the midst of the seas. Your builders have perfected your beauty.
They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make you a mast.
Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; the company of the Ashurites have inlaid your planks with ivory from the coasts of Kittim.
Fine embroidered linen from Egypt was what you spread for your sail; violet and purple from the coasts of Elishah was what covered you.
The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen; your wise men, O Tyre, were in you; they became your sailors.
The elders of Gebal and its wise men were in you to caulk your seams; all the ships of the sea and their oarsmen were in you to exchange your merchandise.
Those from Persia, Lydia, and Libya were in your army as men of war; they hung shield and helmet in you; they gave splendor to you.
Men of Arvad with your army were on your walls all around, and the men of Gammad were in your towers; they hung their shields on your walls all around; they made your beauty perfect.
Tarshish traded with you because of the multitude of your wealth. They gave you silver, iron, tin, and lead for your goods.
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you. They exchanged souls of men and vessels of bronze for your merchandise.
Those from the house of Togarmah traded for your wares with horses, steeds, and mules.
The men of Dedan traded with you; many shores were the market of your hand. They brought you ivory tusks and ebony as payment.
Syria traded with you because of the abundance of goods you made. They exchanged for your wares emeralds, purple, embroidery, fine linen, corals, and rubies.
Judah and the land of Israel traded with you. They exchanged for your merchandise wheat of Minnith, millet, honey, oil, and balm.
Damascus traded with you because of the abundance of goods you made, because of your great wealth, with the wine of Helbon and with white wool.
Dan and Javan paid for your wares, traversing back and forth. Wrought iron, cassia, and cane were among your merchandise.
Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding.
Arabia and all the rulers of Kedar traded with you regularly. They traded with you in lambs, rams, and goats.
The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you. They exchanged for your wares the choicest spices, all kinds of precious stones, and gold.
Haran, Canneh, Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Assyria, and Chilmad traded with you.
These traded with you in choice items; in purple clothes, in embroidered work, in cedar chests of multicolored apparel, bound tightly with cords, which were in your marketplace.
The ships of Tarshish traveled with your merchandise. You were filled and very glorious in the midst of the seas.
Your oarsmen brought you into many waters, but the east wind has broken you in the midst of the seas.
Your riches, wares, and merchandise, your mariners and pilots, your caulkers and merchandisers, all your men of war who are in you, and the entire company which is in your midst, will fall into the midst of the seas on the day of your ruin.
The open lands will shake at the sound of the cry of your sailors.
All who handle the oar, the mariners, all the sailors of the sea will come down from their ships and stand on the land.
They will make their voice heard because of you; they will cry bitterly and cast dust on their heads; they will wallow in ashes;
and they will shave themselves completely bald because of you, gird themselves with sackcloth, and weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.
And in their wailing for you they will take up a lamentation, and lament for you: What city is like Tyre, destroyed in the midst of the sea?
When your wares went out by sea, you satisfied many people; you enriched the kings of the earth with the abundance of your wealth and your merchandise.
But you are broken by the seas in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and the entire company will fall in your midst.
All the inhabitants of many shores will be astonished at you; their kings will be in dread, and their countenance will be enraged.
The merchants among the peoples will hiss at you; you will become a terror, and be no more forever.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your heart is lifted up, and you say, I am a god, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas, yet you are a man, and not the Mighty God, though you set your heart as the heart of God
(Behold, you are wiser than Daniel. There is no secret that can be hidden from you.
With your wisdom and your understanding you have gained riches for yourself, and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;
by your great wisdom in trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches).
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,
behold, therefore, I will bring strangers against you, the most terrifying of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and defile your splendor.
They shall throw you down to the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the midst of the seas.
Will you still think to say before him who slays you, I am God? But you are a man, and not a god, in the hand of him who slays you.
You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You seal the measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
You have been in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created.
You were the anointed cherub that covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.
You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.
By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as profane out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.
Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground, I have set you before kings, that they might observe you.
You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading; therefore I bring fire from your midst; it has devoured you, and I consign you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you.
All who know you among the peoples have been astonished at you; you shall become a terror, and shall be no more forever.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her,
and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; I will be glorified in your midst; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments in her and have been sanctified in her.
For I will send pestilence upon her, and blood into her streets; the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword which is against her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn unto the house of Israel from all who surround them, who despise them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and have been sanctified in them in the eyes of the nations, then they will dwell in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob.
And they shall dwell safely there, build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
Speak, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Pharaoh king of Egypt, O great monster who lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My River is my own; I have made it for myself.
But I will put hooks in your jaws, and cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales; I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers, and all the fish in your rivers will stick to your scales.
And I will leave you in the wilderness, you and all the fish of your rivers; you shall fall on the open field; you shall not be brought together nor gathered. I have given you as food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.
And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
When they took hold of you by the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins stand.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast.
And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he has said, The River is mine, and I have made it.
Indeed, therefore, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia.
Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years.
And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate; and among the cities that are laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.
Yet, thus says the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples there where they were scattered.
I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.
It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore.
No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity when they turned to follow them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to work hard against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder rubbed raw; yet neither he nor his army received wages from Tyre, for the labor which they expended on it.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He shall take away her wealth, carry off her plunder, and remove her spoils; and that will be the wages for his army.
I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor, because they worked for Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.
In that day I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in their midst. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying,
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Howl, Alas for the day!
For the day is near, even the day of Jehovah is near; it will be a day of clouds, the time of the nations.
And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they take away her wealth, and her foundations are broken down.
Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, all the mixed people, Chub, and the men of the lands who are allied, shall fall with them by the sword.
Thus says Jehovah: Those who support Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down. From Migdol to Syene those within her shall fall by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And they shall be desolate in the midst of the desolate lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are laid waste.
And they will know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt and all her helpers have been destroyed.
In that day messengers shall go forth from Me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid, and great anguish shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for indeed it is coming!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also bring an end to the multitude of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land; they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of evil ones; I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers. I, Jehovah, have spoken.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and remove the images from Noph; there shall no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt; and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments in No.
I will pour My fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No,
and set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall writhe in anguish, No shall be split open, and Noph shall be in daily distress.
The young men of Aven and Pibeseth shall fall by the sword, and these cities shall go into captivity.
At Tahpanhes the day shall also be darkened, when I break the yokes of Egypt there. And her arrogant strength shall come to an end in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and see, it has not been bound up for healing, nor a bandage set to bind it, to make it strong to hold a sword.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong one and the one that was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them throughout the earth.
And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.
Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down. And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall have stretched it out against the land of Egypt.
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: Whom are you like in your greatness?
Behold, Assyria was like a cedar in Lebanon, with fine branches that shaded the forest, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.
The waters made it grow; the depths gave it height, with their rivers running around the place where it was planted, and sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field.
Therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field; its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long because of the abundance of water, as it sent them out.
All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and in its shadow all great nations made their home.
Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches, because its roots reached to abundant waters.
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir trees were not like its boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like its branches; no tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.
I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied it.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and its heart was lifted up in its height,
therefore I have delivered it into the hand of the Mighty God of the nations, and He shall surely deal with it; I have driven it out for its wickedness.
And strangers, the most terrifying of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie broken by all the ravines of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it.
On its ruin will dwell all the birds of the heavens, and all the beasts of the field shall be on its branches;
so that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them. For they have all been delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the sons of men who go down to the Pit.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when it went down to Sheol, I caused mourning. I covered the deep for it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.
I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth.
They also went down to Sheol with it, with those slain by the sword; and those who were its arm, who dwelt in its shadows among the nations.
To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a young lion among the nations, and you are like a monster in the seas, bursting forth in your rivers, stirring up the waters with your feet, and fouling their rivers.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will therefore spread My net over you with a company of many people, and they will draw you up in My net.
Then I will leave you on the land; I will cast you out upon the open fields, and cause all the birds of the heavens to settle on you. And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.
I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your corpses.
I will also water the land with the flow of your blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines will be full of you.
When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, and bring darkness upon your land, declares the Lord Jehovah.
I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your ruin among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.
Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid at you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.
By the swords of the mighty, all of them the most terrifying of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall. They shall plunder the majesty of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.
I will also destroy all its animals from beside its great waters; the foot of man shall muddy them no more, nor shall the hooves of animals stir them up.
Then I will make their waters settle, and make their rivers run like oil, says the Lord Jehovah.
When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and the land is destitute of all that once filled it, when I strike all who dwell in it, then they shall know that I am Jehovah.
This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her; the daughters of the nations shall lament her; they shall lament for her, for Egypt, and for all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.
It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down to the lowest parts of the earth, her and the daughters of the majestic nations, with those who go down to the Pit:
Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, be laid with the uncircumcised.
They shall fall in the midst of those slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword, drawing her and all her multitudes.
The mighty among the strong shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him: they have gone down, they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
Assyria is there, and all her company, with their graves all around her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword.
Her graves are set in the recesses of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
There is Elam and all her multitude, all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, with all her multitude, with her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; it was put in the midst of the slain.
There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes, with all their graves around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.
They do not lie with the mighty of the uncircumcised who are fallen, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war; they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities will be on their bones, though the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.
Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and lie with those slain by the sword.
There is Edom, her kings and all her rulers, who with their might are laid beside those slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the Pit.
There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, in shame at the terror which they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.
Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.
For I have caused My terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from their borders and make him their watchman,
when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the shofar and warns the people,
then whoever listens to hear the sound of the shofar and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be on his own head.
He heard the sound of the shofar, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his soul.
But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the shofar, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any soul from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity. But his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.
So you, son of man: I have made you a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore you shall hear the Word from My mouth and warn them from Me.
When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall die the death! and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.
Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.
Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you say, If our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and we pine away in them, how can we then live?
Say to them: As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I take no delight in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! For why will you die, O house of Israel?
Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: The righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression. As for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of his righteousness in the day that he sins.
When I say to the righteous that he shall live life, but he trusts in his own righteousness and commits iniquity, none of all his righteousness shall be remembered; but because of the iniquity that he has done, he shall die.
Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall die the death; if he turns from his sin and does justice and righteousness,
if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life, not committing iniquity, he shall live life; he shall not die.
None of all his sins which he has sinned shall be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness; he shall live life.
Yet the children of your people say, The way of Jehovah is not fair. But as for them, it is their way which is not fair!
When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die because of it.
But when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does justice and righteousness, he shall live because of it.
Yet you say, The way of Jehovah is not fair. O house of Israel, I shall judge each one of you according to his ways.
And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, that one who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, The city has been struck!
Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me the evening before the man came who had escaped. And He had opened my mouth; so when he came to me in the morning, my mouth was opened, and I was no longer mute.
Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, they who inhabit the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, Abraham was one, and he took possession of the land. But we are many; the land is given to us as a possession.
Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You eat meat with blood, you lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood. Shall you then possess the land?
You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and you defile each one his neighbor’s wife. Shall you then possess the land?
Say thus to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely those who are in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and caves shall die of the pestilence.
For I will make the land a desolate waste, her arrogant strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that no one will pass through.
Then they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all their abominations which they have done.
As for you, son of man, the children of your people are talking about you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses; and they speak to one another, everyone saying to his brother, Please come and hear what the Word is that comes from Jehovah.
So they come to you as people do, they sit before you as My people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them; for with their mouth they act out love, but their hearts go after their unjust gain.
Indeed you are to them as a singer of love songs, as one who has a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they do not do them.
So when this comes to pass (surely it will come); then they will know that a prophet has been among them.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the shepherds: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool; you slaughter the fatlings, but you do not feed the flock.
The weak you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who were sick, nor bound up the broken, nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them.
So they were scattered because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.
My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill; yes, My flock was scattered over the whole face of the earth, and no one was seeking or searching for them.
Therefore, you shepherds, hear the Word of Jehovah:
As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely because My flock became a prey, and My flock became food for every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, nor did My shepherds search for My flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock;
therefore, O shepherds, hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hand; I will cause them to cease feeding the sheep, and the shepherds shall feed themselves no more; for I will deliver My flock from their mouths, that they may no longer be food for them.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Indeed I Myself will search for My sheep and seek them out.
As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day he is among his scattered sheep, so will I seek out My sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day.
And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the lands, and will bring them to their own land; I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the dwelling places of the land.
I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down, declares the Lord Jehovah.
I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick; but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and feed them with judgment.
And as for you, O My flock, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and he goats.
Is it a small thing for you to have eaten up the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to have drunk of the clear waters, that you must foul the rest with your feet?
And as for My flock, they eat what you have trampled with your feet, and they drink what you have fouled with your feet.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Because you have pushed with side and shoulder, thrust at all the weak ones with your horns, and scattered them abroad,
therefore I will save My flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
I will raise up one Shepherd over them, and He shall feed them; My servant David. He shall feed them and be their Shepherd.
And I, Jehovah, will be their God, and My Servant David a prince among them; I, Jehovah, have spoken.
I will make a covenant of peace with them, and remove the evil beasts out of the land; and they will dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the wooded forests.
And I will make them and the places all around My hill a blessing; and I will cause showers to come down in their season; there shall be showers of blessing.
Then the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase. They shall be safe in their land; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from the hand of those who enslaved them.
And they shall no longer be a prey for the nations, nor shall beasts of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid.
I will raise up for them a notable plantation, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, nor bear the shame of the nations any more.
Thus they shall know that I, Jehovah their God, am with them, and they, the house of Israel, are My people, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And you men, the flock of My pasture, are My flock; and I am your God, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,
and say to it, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against you; I will stretch out My hand against you, and make you most desolate;
I shall lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity had come to an end;
therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.
Thus I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste, and cut off from it the one who passes through and the one who returns.
And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall.
I will make you desolate forever, and your cities shall not again be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we will possess them (although Jehovah was there),
therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are desolate; they are given to us to consume.
Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard them.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The whole earth will rejoice when I make you desolate.
As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you. You shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom; all of it! And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy has said of you, Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,
therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people;
therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around;
therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against Edom, all who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with whole-hearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open land.
Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I have raised My hand and sworn that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their shame.
But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are drawing near to come.
For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.
I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You devour men and bereave your nation,
therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.
Nor will I let you hear the insults of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:
Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. To Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.
Therefore I poured out My fury on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because of their idols with which they had defiled it.
And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the earth. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.
When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name. They said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they have come out of His land.
But I had compassion for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, there where they went.
Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for the sake of My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, there where you went.
And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, when I am sanctified in you before their eyes.
For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all the lands, and bring you into your own land.
Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your defilement and from all your idols.
I will also give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do them.
And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.
I will deliver you from all your defilements. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you.
And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the produce of your fields, so that you never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations.
Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations.
Let it be known to you that I do not do this for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt.
The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.
And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.
Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, Jehovah, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do this for them. I will increase their men like a flock.
Like a holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem on its appointed feasts, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
The hand of Jehovah was upon me and brought me out by the Spirit of Jehovah, and made me rest in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.
Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry.
And He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? So I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.
Again He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the Word of Jehovah!
Thus says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.
So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a shaking; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.
And as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.
Then He said to me, Prophesy to the spirit; prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.
So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.
Then He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!
Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up out of your graves.
I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, says Jehovah.
Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Moreover, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions. Then take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions.
Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand.
And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?
say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.
And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.
And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, there where they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;
and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again.
They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them out of all their dwelling places where they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Thus they shall be My people, and I will be their God.
And David My servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one Shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and keep My statutes, and do them.
And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their children’s children, always; and My servant David shall be their prince forever.
Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.
My tabernacle also shall be with them; yes, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And the nations will know that I, Jehovah, sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forever.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
And I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords.
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops; and many people with you.
Prepare yourself and be ready, you and all your companies that are gathered about you; and be a guard to them.
After many days you will be visited. In the last final years you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many peoples on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely.
You will ascend, and come like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many people with you.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.
You shall say, I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a people at peace, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;
to plunder the spoils and to steal a prize, to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered out of the nations, who produce livestock and goods, who dwell in the center of the earth.
Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, Have you come to plunder the spoils? Have you gathered your army to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to plunder a great spoils?
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?
And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.
And you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last final days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me, when I am sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you he of whom I have spoken in former days by My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?
And it shall come to pass on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, that My fury shall arise in My face.
For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken. Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel,
so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall quake at My presence. The mountains shall be thrown down, the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains, declares the Lord Jehovah. Every man’s sword shall be against his brother.
And I will judge him with pestilence and blood; I will rain down upon him, on his troops, and on the many people who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
Thus I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;
and I will turn you around and lead you on, bringing you up from the recesses of the north, and bring you upon the mountains of Israel.
And I will knock the bow out of your left hand, and cause the arrows to fall out of your right hand.
You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the people who are with you. I will give you to the birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.
You shall fall upon the open field; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the coastlands. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.
Thus I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and I will not let My holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.
Behold, it is coming, and it shall be done, declares the Lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I have spoken.
And those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the javelins and spears; and they shall kindle fires with them for seven years.
They will not take wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests, because they will kindle fires with the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them, and pillage those who pillaged them, declares the Lord Jehovah.
It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will stop the noses of travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude. Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.
For seven months the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.
Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain renown for it on the day that I am glorified, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And they will assign men to continually pass through the land, traveling along, to bury those remaining on the face of the earth, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.
And any traveler passing through the land, when anyone sees a man’s bone, he shall set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.
The name of the city will also be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the land.
And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field: Assemble yourselves and come; gather together from all sides to My sacrifice which I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.
You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams and lambs, of goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
You shall eat fat till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk, at My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
You shall be filled at My table with horses and riders, with mighty men and with all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.
And I will set My glory among the nations; all the nations shall see My judgments which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them.
Thus the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God from that day forward.
And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face from them. I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.
According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I have dealt with them, and hidden My face from them.
Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Now I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name;
after they have borne their shame, and all their treachery in which they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no one made them afraid.
When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and I am sanctified in them in the eyes of many nations,
then they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who sent them into captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their own land, and left none of them there.
And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.
In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on the very same day the hand of Jehovah was upon me; and He brought me there.
In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and rested me on a very high mountain; on which toward the south was something like the structure of a city.
He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze. He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gate.
And the man said to me, Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.
Now there was a wall all around the outside of the house. In the man’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.
Then he went to the gate which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide, and the other threshold was one rod wide.
Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; between the guardrooms was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the inside gate was one rod.
He also measured the porch of the inside gate, one rod.
Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the pillars, two cubits. The porch of the gate was on the inside.
And in the eastward gate were three guardrooms on one side and three on the other; the three were all the same size; also the pillars were of the same size on this side and that side.
He measured the width of the entrance to the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.
And the space in front of the guardrooms was one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side; the guardrooms were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.
Then he measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the other; the width was twenty-five cubits, as door faces door.
He measured the pillars, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gate extended to the pillar.
From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.
And there were shuttered windows in the guardrooms and in their pillars on the inside of the gate all around, and likewise in the arches. There were windows all around on the inside. And on each pillar were palm trees.
Then he brought me into the outer court; and there were rooms and a pavement made all around the court; thirty rooms faced the pavement.
The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.
On the outer court was also a gate facing north, and he measured its length and its width.
Its guardrooms, three on this side and three on that side, its pillars and its arches, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.
Its windows and those of its porches, and also its palm trees, had the same measurements as the gate facing east; they went up to it by seven steps, and its arches were in front of it.
And the gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gate, just as the eastern gate; and he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.
After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gate was facing south; and he measured its pillars and arches according to these same measurements.
There were windows in it and its arches all around like those windows; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.
Seven steps led up to it, and its arches were in front of them; and it had palm trees on its pillars, one on this side and one on that side.
There was also a gate on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.
Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gate; and he measured the southern gate according to these same measurements.
And its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.
And its arches faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars, and going up to it were eight steps.
And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gate according to these same measurements.
Also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.
Its arches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side; and going up to it were eight steps.
And he brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these same measurements;
also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches. It had windows all around; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.
Its pillars faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side, and going up to it were eight steps.
There was a room and its entrance by the pillars of the gate, where they washed the burnt offering.
In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.
At the outer side of the porch, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.
Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices.
There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables.
Outside the inner gate were the rooms for the singers in the inner court, one facing south beside the northern gate, and the other facing north beside the southern gate.
Then he said to me, This room which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the house.
The room which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near Jehovah to serve Him.
And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. And the altar was in front of the house.
And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured the pillars of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and by the steps which led up to it there were columns by the pillars, one on this side and another on that side.
Then he brought me into the sanctuary and measured the pillars, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side; the width of the tent.
And the width of the entryway was ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance were five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.
And he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits high; and the width of the entrance, seven cubits.
He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, This is the Holy of Holies.
Next, he measured the wall of the house, six cubits. The width of each side room all around the house was four cubits on every side.
The side rooms were in three stories, one above the other, thirty rooms in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the house.
As one went up from story to story, the side rooms became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the house ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one.
I also saw the height of the house all around; the foundation of the side rooms was a full rod, that is, six cubits high.
The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits, and so was also the remaining area of the side rooms of the house.
And between it and the rooms was a width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.
The doors of the side rooms opened toward the open area, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the open area was five cubits all around.
The building that faced the separate area at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.
So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate area with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long.
And the width of the eastern face of the house, including the separate area, was one hundred cubits.
And he measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separate area, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,
their thresholds and the shuttered windows. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows (the windows were covered),
from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.
And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,
so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the house all around.
From the ground to the space above the door, and on the wall of the temple, cherubim and palm trees were carved.
The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one was as the appearance of the other.
The altar of wood, was three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.
The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
The doors had two doors each, two turning doors: two for one door, and two doors for the other.
And Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just like the ones carved on the walls. And wooden planks were on the front of the porch outside.
There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; also on the side rooms of the house and on the planks.
Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the room which was opposite the separate area, and which was in front of the building toward the north.
Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door.
Opposite the inner court of twenty cubits, and opposite the pavement of the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.
And in front of the rooms, toward the inside, was a walkway ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north.
Now the upper rooms were shorter, because the galleries took away space from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building.
For they were in three stories and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore the upper level was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up.
And a wall which was outside ran alongside the rooms, at the front of the rooms, toward the outer court; its length was fifty cubits.
The length of the rooms toward the outer court was fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple was one hundred cubits.
And under these rooms was the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.
There were rooms in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separate area and opposite the building.
And there was a walkway in front of them also, and their appearance was like the rooms which were toward the north; they were as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances were according to plan.
And corresponding to the doors of the rooms that were facing south, as one enters them, there was a door in front of the walkway, the walkway directly in front of the wall toward the east.
Then he said to me, The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate area, are the holy rooms where the priests who approach Jehovah shall eat the set apart, holy, offerings. There they shall lay the set apart, holy, offerings; the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.
When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy room into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.
Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.
He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.
He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.
He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.
He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.
He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy from the profane.
Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate that faces toward the east.
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.
It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw; like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.
And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate which faces toward the east.
And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house. And standing beside me was a Man.
And He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.
When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they have defiled My holy name by the abominations which they have done; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.
Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.
Son of man, describe the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.
And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and do them.
This is the law of the house: The entire region around the mountaintop is set apart, holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the upper part of the altar:
from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, one cubit.
The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.
And the altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;
the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.
And He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.
And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites (who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to serve Me), says the Lord Jehovah.
You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.
Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it at the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.
On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats that is whole for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.
When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull that is whole, and a ram that is whole from the flock.
And you shall offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.
Every day for seven days you shall prepare a he goat for a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both that are whole.
Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and consecrate it.
And when these days are completed, it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you, says the Lord Jehovah.
Then He brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary which faces toward the east. And it was shut.
And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because Jehovah the God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.
As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.
Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah; and I fell on my face.
And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah and all its laws. Mark well the entrance to the house and all the exits from the sanctuary.
And say to the rebellious, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: O house of Israel, Enough of all your abominations!
When you brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My sanctuary to defile it; My house; and when you offered My food, the fat and the blood, then they broke My covenant because of all your abominations.
And you have not kept charge of My holy things, but you have set others to keep charge of My sanctuary for you.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter My sanctuary, including any son of a foreigner who is among the children of Israel.
And the Levites who went far from Me, when Israel went astray, who strayed away from Me after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity.
Yet they shall be ministers in My sanctuary, as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to stumble into iniquity, therefore I have raised My hand and sworn against them, declares the Lord Jehovah; and they shall bear their iniquity.
And they shall not come near Me to serve Me as priest, nor come near any of My holy things, nor into the Holy of Holies; but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have done.
Nevertheless I will make them keep charge of the house, for all its labor, and for all that has to be done in it.
But the priests, the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept charge of My sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near Me to serve Me; and they shall stand before Me to offer to Me the fat and the blood, declares the Lord Jehovah.
They shall enter My sanctuary, and they shall come near My table to serve Me, and they shall keep My charge.
And it shall be, that whenever they enter the gates of the inner court, that they shall put on linen garments; no wool shall come upon them while they minister within the gates of the inner court or within the house.
They shall have linen turbans on their heads and linen trousers on their loins; they shall not clothe themselves with anything that causes sweat.
And when they go out to the outer court, to the outer court to the people, they shall take off their garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy rooms, and put on other garments; and in their own garments they shall not consecrate the people.
They shall neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long; but they shall keep their hair clipped and trimmed.
No priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner court.
They shall not take as wife a widow or a divorced woman, but take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or widows of priests.
And they shall teach My people the difference between the holy and the profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.
And in a dispute they shall stand as judges, and judge it according to My judgments. They shall keep My Laws and My statutes in all My appointed times, and they shall consecrate My Sabbaths.
They shall not defile themselves by coming near a dead person. Only for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister may they defile themselves.
After he is cleansed, they shall count seven days for him.
And on the day that he goes to the sanctuary to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering in the inner court, says the Lord Jehovah.
It shall be, in regard to their inheritance, that I am their inheritance. You shall give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession.
They shall eat the food offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.
The first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every sacrifice of any kind from all your sacrifices, shall be for the priests; you shall also give to the priest the first of your ground meal, to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
The priests shall not eat anything, bird or beast, that died naturally or was torn by wild beasts.
Moreover, when you divide the land by lot for inheritance, you shall offer a heave offering unto Jehovah, a holy portion of the land; its length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand. It shall be holy throughout its borders all around.
Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space.
So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.
It shall be a holy portion of the land for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve Jehovah; it shall be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary.
An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house; they shall have twenty rooms as a possession.
You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long, next to the set-apart offerings; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.
And the prince shall have a portion on both sides of the set-apart offerings and the city’s portion; facing the set-apart offerings and the city’s portion, extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length shall be alongside one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My rulers shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Enough, O rulers of Israel! Put away violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people, says the Lord Jehovah.
You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.
The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer.
The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.
This is the offering which you shall offer: one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.
The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor. (A kor is a homer or ten baths, for ten baths are a homer.)
And one lamb shall be given from a flock of two hundred, from the watered land of Israel. These shall be for grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord Jehovah.
All the people of the land shall give this offering for the prince in Israel.
And it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the New Moons, the Sabbaths, and at all the appointed times of the house of Israel. He shall prepare the sin offering, the grain offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make atonement for the house of Israel.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull that is whole and cleanse the sanctuary.
And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the gateposts of the inner court.
And thus you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who goes astray and for him who sins in ignorance. Thus you shall make atonement for the house.
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall observe the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
And on that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to Jehovah, seven bulls and seven rams that are whole, daily for seven days, and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.
And he shall prepare a grain offering of one ephah for each bull and one ephah for each ram, together with a hin of oil for each ephah.
In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, at the feast, he shall do likewise for seven days, according to the sin offering, the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the oil.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner court that faces toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
And the prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from the outside, and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.
Likewise the people of the land shall bow down at the entrance to this gate before Jehovah on the Sabbaths and the new moons.
And the burnt offering that the prince offers to Jehovah on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs that are whole, and a ram that is whole;
and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as he shall be able to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah.
On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull from the herd that is whole, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be ones that are whole.
And he shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.
And when the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.
But when the people of the land come before Jehovah on the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate.
And the prince shall be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.
At the feasts and the appointed times the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.
Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to Jehovah, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened to him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.
You shall daily make a burnt offering to Jehovah of a lamb of the first year that is whole; you shall prepare it morning by morning.
And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to Jehovah.
Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, as a regular burnt offering every morning.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.
But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.
Moreover the prince shall not take any of the people’s inheritance by evicting them from their possession; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possession, so that none of My people may be scattered from his possession.
And He brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms of the priests which face toward the north; and there was a place on the two sides westward.
And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to consecrate the people.
Then he brought me out to the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, at every corner of the court there was another court.
At the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.
There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around.
And he said to me, These are the kitchens where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.
Then he brought me back to the entrance of the house; and there was water, flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the front of the house faces east; and the water was flowing from under the right side of the house, south of the altar.
He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faces east; and there was water, running out on the right side.
And when the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water came up to the ankles.
Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water came up to the knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to the waist.
Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water was too deep; water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.
And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? And he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.
When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees on one side and the other.
Then he said to me: This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the wilderness, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed.
And it shall be that every living thing that swarms, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river shall come.
It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.
But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.
And along the banks of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.
Thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.
And you shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.
And this shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran).
Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.
And on the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and to the Eastern Sea. This is the east side.
And the south side, toward the south, shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side, toward the South.
And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side.
Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
And it shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who sojourn among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourns, there you shall give him his inheritance, declares the Lord Jehovah.
Now these are the names of the tribes: From the northern border along the road to Hethlon at the entrance of Hamath, to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus northward, in the direction of Hamath, there shall be one portion for Dan from its east to its west side;
by the border of Dan, from the east side to the west, one portion for Asher;
by the border of Asher, from the east side to the west, one portion for Naphtali;
by the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west, one portion for Manasseh;
by the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west, one portion for Ephraim;
by the border of Ephraim, from the east side to the west, one portion for Reuben;
by the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west, one portion for Judah;
by the border of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the offering which you shall contribute, twenty-five thousand cubits in width, and in length the same as one of the other portions, from the east side to the west. And the sanctuary shall be in the middle of it.
The offering that you shall contribute unto Jehovah shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width.
And this holy offering shall belong to the priests; on the north twenty-five thousand cubits in length, on the west ten thousand in width, on the east ten thousand in width, and on the south twenty-five thousand in length. And the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the middle.
It shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok, who are consecrated, who have kept My charge, who did not go astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
And this contribution of land that is offered shall be to them a thing set apart, holy, by the border of the Levites.
And next to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have an area twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in width; its entire length shall be twenty-five thousand and its width ten thousand.
And they shall not sell or change any of it; nor pass through and take away the firstfruit of the land; for it is holy unto Jehovah.
And the five thousand cubits in width that remain, along the edge of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use by the city, for dwellings and suburbs. And the city shall be in the middle of it.
These shall be its measurements: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.
And the suburbs of the city shall be to the north two hundred and fifty cubits, to the south two hundred and fifty, to the east two hundred and fifty, and to the west two hundred and fifty.
And the rest of the length, alongside the offering of the holy portion, shall be ten thousand cubits to the east and ten thousand to the west. It shall be adjacent to the offering of the holy portion, and its produce shall be for food to those who work in the city.
And those who work in the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall work it.
The entire offering shall be twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand cubits, foursquare. You shall offer the holy offerings with the possession of the city.
The rest shall belong to the prince, on one side and on the other of the holy offering and of the city’s possession, next to the twenty-five thousand cubits of the offering as far as the eastern border, and westward next to the twenty-five thousand as far as the western border, adjacent to the tribal portions; it shall belong to the prince. It shall be the holy offering, and the sanctuary of the house in the middle.
Moreover, from the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city which are in the midst of what belongs to the prince, the area between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the prince.
As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side to the west, Benjamin shall have one portion;
and by the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon shall have one portion;
and by the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Issachar shall have one portion;
and by the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west, Zebulun shall have one portion;
and by the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, Gad shall have one portion;
and by the border of Gad, on the south side, toward the South, the border shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the river to the Great Sea.
This is the land which you shall divide by lot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, says the Lord Jehovah.
And these are the exits of the city. On the north side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits
(the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel), the three gates northward: one gate for Reuben, one gate for Judah, and one gate for Levi;
and on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Joseph, one gate for Benjamin, and one gate for Dan;
and on the south side, measuring four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates: one gate for Simeon, one gate for Issachar, and one gate for Zebulun;
and on the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits with their three gates: one gate for Gad, one gate for Asher, and one gate for Naphtali.
All the way around shall be eighteen thousand cubits; and the name of the city from that day shall be, JEHOVAH IS THERE.
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god. And he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
And the king spoke to Ashpenaz, the chief of his officials that he should bring some of the sons of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the nobles,
young men in whom was no blemish, but who were of good appearance and having understanding in all wisdom, having knowledge and understanding science, even those with ability in them to stand in the king’s palace; to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
And the king appointed for them a daily portion every day, from the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank, even to raise them three years, so that at the end of that time they might stand before the king.
And there were among those of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
to whom the chief of the officials gave names. For he called Daniel, Belteshazzar; and Hananiah, Shadrach; and Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego.
And Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s food, or with the wine which he drank. So he asked of the chief of the officials that he might not defile himself.
Now God had brought Daniel into kindness and compassion with the chief of the officials.
And the chief of the officials said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the other boys who are your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.
And Daniel said to Melzar, whom the chief of the officials had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
Please, test your servants ten days, and let us be given vegetables to eat, and water to drink.
Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the boys who eat of the king’s food; and as you see fit, do so with your servants.
And he consented to them in this matter and tested them ten days.
And at the end of ten days their appearance looked better and fatter of flesh than all the boys who were eating the king’s food.
So Melzar took away their food and the wine that they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables.
As for these four boys, God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
And at the end of the days that the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the officials brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
And the king talked with them. And among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they served before the king.
And in any matter of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them to be ten times better than all the magicians and conjurers who were in all his kingdom.
And Daniel continued to the first year of King Cyrus.
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar was dreaming dreams, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.
And the king commanded to call the magicians, and the conjurers, and the sorcerers and the Chaldeans, to declare to the king his dreams. And they came and stood before the king.
And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.
And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic: O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will explain the interpretation.
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The command is gone from me. If you will not make known the dream and its interpretation to me, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an outhouse.
But if you declare the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore, declare the dream and its interpretation to me.
They again replied and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will explain its interpretation.
The king answered and said, I know that you would buy time, because you see that the command is gone from me.
But if you will not make the dream known to me, there is one law for you. For you have agreed upon lying and deceiving words to speak before me until the time has changed. Therefore, tell me the dream, then I shall know that you have the ability to explain the interpretation to me.
The Chaldeans replied before the king and said, There is not a man on the earth who can declare the king’s matter, because not any king, lord, or ruler has asked such a thing from any magician, or conjurer, or Chaldean.
And the thing that the king asks is rare. And there is no other who can declare it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
Because of all this the king was enraged and angered. And he commanded all the wise men of Babylon to be destroyed.
And the law went out that the wise men should be killed. And they searched for Daniel and his companions, to be killed.
Then Daniel answered with counsel and discretion to Arioch the chief of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
He answered and said to Arioch, the king’s officer, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? And Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
And Daniel went in and asked of the king that he would give him time, and he would declare to the king the interpretation.
Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,
that they might pray for the mercies of God in Heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision, and Daniel blessed the God of Heaven.
Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are His.
And He changes the times and the seasons; He removes kings, and sets up kings; He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those who have understanding.
He reveals the deep and secret things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light dwells in Him.
I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers, who has given me wisdom and might, and has made known to me what we asked of You. For You have made known to us the king’s matter.
Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and said this to him, Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me before the king, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.
Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and spoke this to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king.
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?
Daniel replied before the king and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot be declared to the king by the wise men, the conjurers, the magicians, or the fortunetellers.
But there is a God in Heaven who reveals secrets, and makes known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:
As for you, O king, thoughts came to you on your bed, about what should come to pass after this. And He who reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.
You, O king, were watching, and behold, a certain great image! This great image stood before you with extraordinary brightness, and its form was dreadful.
The head of this image was of fine gold, its chest and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,
its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
You watched until it happened that a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were together broken to pieces, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. And the wind carried them away so that they could not be found anywhere. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.
This is the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.
You O king are a king of kings. For the God of Heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and honor.
And wherever the sons of men, the animals of the field, and the birds of the sky dwell, He has given them into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.
And in your place shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours, and another third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron. Inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters all things, and like iron that crushes all these, it will break in pieces and crush.
And whereas you saw the feet and the toes, partly of potters’ clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided. But there shall be in it the strength of iron, just as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.
And as you saw the iron mixed with the miry clay, they shall become mixed with the seed of men. But they shall not cleave to one another, even as iron does not fellowship with clay.
And in the days of these kings, the God of Heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed. And the kingdom shall not be left to other people. It shall break in pieces and bring all these kingdoms to an end, and it shall stand forever.
Inasmuch as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold in pieces, the Great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass after this. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it is sure.
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face prostrate before Daniel. And he commanded that they present an offering to him with incense.
The king answered Daniel and said, Your God truly is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and a Revealer of secrets, since you could reveal this secret.
Then the king made Daniel great and gave him many great gifts. And he made him ruler over all the province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
And Daniel petitioned the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego over the affairs of the province of Babylon. But Daniel sat in the gate of the king.
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was sixty cubits; its breadth, six cubits. He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges and the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the justices, and all the officials of the provinces, to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
Then the herald cried with strength: To you it is commanded O peoples, nations, and languages,
that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and prostrate yourselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.
And whoever does not fall down and prostrate themselves, at that moment they will be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.
So at that time when all the people heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and languages fell down, prostrating themselves before the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
Then at that time certain Chaldeans approached and accused the Jews.
They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever!
You, O king, have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and the bagpipe, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and prostrate himself before the golden image.
And whoever does not fall down and prostrate himself, he should be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.
There are certain Jews whom you have set over the administration of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men, O king, do not give due regard to you. They do not serve your gods nor prostrate themselves before the golden image which you have set up.
Then Nebuchadnezzar in anger and wrath commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my gods, nor prostrate yourselves before the golden image which I have set up?
Now if you are ready, at the time you hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, zither, the lyre, harp, and bagpipe, and all kinds of music, fall down and prostrate yourselves before the image which I have made. But if you do not prostrate yourselves, in that moment you shall be thrown into the middle of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that god who shall deliver you out of my hand?
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
If it is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.
But even if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor prostrate ourselves before the golden image which you have set up.
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with wrath, and the form of his face was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He spoke and commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usual to heat it.
And he commanded mighty men of valor from his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the burning fiery furnace.
Then these men were tied up in their coats, their tunics, and their turbans, and their other clothes, and were thrown into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
Therefore also, because the king’s command was urgent, and the furnace exceedingly hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was startled. And he rose up in haste; he spoke and said to his counselors, Did we not throw three men bound into the middle of the fire? They replied and said to the king, True, O king.
He answered and said, Behold! I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and there is no harm to them. And the form of the fourth is like the son of a god.
Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace. He answered and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the middle of the fire.
And the satraps, the prefects, the governors, and the king’s counselors gathered around. And they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power, and the hair of their head was not scorched, nor were their coats changed, nor was there any smell of fire on them.
Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His Angel and has delivered His servants who trusted in Him, and have changed the king’s words, and have given their bodies that they might not serve nor prostrate themselves before any god except their own God.
Therefore I make a decree; that every people, nation, and language who speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces and his house shall be made into an outhouse; because there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.
Then the king made Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego prosper in the province of Babylon.
Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and tongues that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.
It seemed good for me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done with me.
How great are His signs! And how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and His dominion is from generation to generation.
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing in my palace.
I saw a dream which terrified me, and the thoughts on my bed and visions of my head troubled me.
So I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.
Then the magicians, the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers came in. And I told the dream before them, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
But at last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And I told the dream before him, saying,
O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.
As for the visions of my head on my bed, I was looking, and, behold, a tree was in the middle of the earth. And its height was great.
The tree became great and strong, and its height reached to the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of all the earth.
Its leaves were beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all was in it. The beasts of the field sought shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher, even a holy one, came down from the heavens.
He cried with might and said this: Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.
Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let it be wet with the dew of the heavens, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.
Let his heart be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the heart of a beast. And let seven times pass over him.
This sentence is by the decree of the watchers, and the command by the word of the holy ones, in order that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever He wills, and sets up over it the lowest of men.
I, Nebuchadnezzar, have seen this dream. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, since all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known the interpretation to me. But you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stunned for a time, and his thoughts troubled him. So the king spoke and said, O Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, may the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!
The tree that you saw, which became great and strong, whose height reached to the heavens and was visible to all the earth,
and its leaves being beautiful, and its fruit plentiful, and food for all being in it, under which the beasts of the field lived, and in its branches the birds of the heavens had their home:
It is you, O king, for you have become great and strong; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the ends of the earth.
And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens, and saying, Cut the tree down, and destroy it. Yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the grass of the field. And let him be wet with the dew of the heavens, and his portion with the beasts of the field, until seven times pass over him.
This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:
And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. And you shall be fed with grass like oxen. And you shall be wet with dew of the heavens; and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and He gives it to whomever He desires.
And whereas they commanded to leave the stump and roots of the tree: Your kingdom shall be secure to you after you have come to know that Heaven rules.
Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you: Even break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; so that perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.
All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.
At the end of twelve months, he was walking in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
The king spoke and said, Is this not great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?
While the word was still in the king’s mouth a voice fell from the heavens, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared: The kingdom has been taken away from you!
And you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be fed with grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you until you know that the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He gives it to whomever He desires.
That very hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar. And he was driven from men, and he ate grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until his hair had grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.
And at the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High. And I praised and honored Him who lives forever, whose dominion is an eternal dominion, and His rule from generation to generation.
And all those living in the earth are counted as nothing. And He does according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among those living in the earth. And no one is able to restrain His hand or say to Him, What are You doing?
At that time my reason returned to me, and the glory of my kingdom, my majesty, and my splendor returned to me. And my counselors and my nobles sought to me. And I was reestablished in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor the King of Heaven, for all His works are truth, and His ways are justice. And He is able to humble those who walk in pride.
Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his nobles. And he drank wine before the thousand.
While tasting the wine, Belshazzar commanded the golden and silver vessels to be brought, those his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple in Jerusalem, that the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.
Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God in Jerusalem. And the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.
They drank wine and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of bronze, of iron, wood, and stone.
At that moment fingers of a man’s hand came out and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace across from the lampstand. And the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.
Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins shook, and his knees knocked one against the other.
The king cried aloud to bring in the conjurers, the Chaldeans, and the fortunetellers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever can read this writing and explain its interpretation shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around his neck. And he shall rule third in the kingdom.
Then all the king’s wise men came in. But they could not read the writing or make the interpretation known to the king.
Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed, and his nobles were perplexed.
The queen came into the banquet house because of the words of the king and his nobles. The queen spoke and said, O king, live forever. Do not let your thoughts terrify you, and do not let your countenance be changed.
There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. And in the days of your father, light and understanding and wisdom were found in him, like the wisdom of the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, your father the king, appointed him master of the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans and fortunetellers;
because an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and declaring riddles, and the solving of problems were found in this Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will give the interpretation.
Then Daniel was thrust in before the king. And the king spoke and said to Daniel, Are you that Daniel who is of the sons of the captives of Judah, whom my father the king brought out of Judah?
I have even heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and light, and excellent wisdom, and understanding are found in you.
And now, the wise men and the conjurers have been thrust in before me, so that they might read this writing and make the interpretation known to me. But they were not able to declare the interpretation of the thing.
And I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and solve problems. Now if you can read the writing and make know to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple and have a golden chain around your neck, and you will rule third in the kingdom.
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let your gifts be for yourself, and give your rewards to another. Yet I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.
O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honor.
And for the majesty that He gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he desired, and whom he desired he kept alive. And whom he would, he set up; and whom he desired, he put down.
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him.
And he was driven from the sons of men. And his heart was made like the animals, and his home was with the wild asses. They fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the heavens, until he knew that the Most High God is Ruler in the kingdom of men, and that He appoints over it whomever He desires.
And you, his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this.
But you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of Heaven. And they have brought the vessels of His house before you. And you, and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines have drunk wine from them. And you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see, nor hear, and do not know. And you have not glorified the God in whose hand your life, breath, and all your ways is.
Then the part of the hand was sent from Him, and this writing was written.
And this is the writing that was written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE: God has numbered your kingdom and finished it.
TEKEL: You are weighed in the balances and found deficient.
PERES: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.
Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a necklace of gold around his neck. And they made a proclamation concerning him, that he should rule third in the kingdom.
That very night Belshazzar, the king of the Chaldeans, was killed.
And Darius the Mede took the kingdom, being about sixty two years old.
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom a hundred and twenty satraps, that they might be over the kingdom.
And over them were three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, so that the satraps might give account to them, and that the king should have no loss.
Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him. And the king was thinking to set him over all the kingdom.
Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom. But they could find no occasion or fault because he was trustworthy. And no error or fault was found in him.
Then these men said, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel unless we find it against him concerning the Law of his God.
Then these presidents and satraps gathered together to the king and said this to him, King Darius, live forever.
All the presidents of the kingdom, the prefects, and the satraps, the officials and the governors, have planned together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except from you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.
Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the document, so that it may not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.
So, King Darius signed the document and the decree.
And when he had learned that the document was signed, Daniel went to his house. And in his roof room, with his windows open toward Jerusalem, he knelt on his knees three times a day, and prayed and praised before his God, as he did before.
Then these men conspired together and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
Then they came near and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree, saying, Have you not signed a decree that every man who shall ask of any god or man within thirty days, except of you, O king, that he shall be thrown into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is certain, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not pass away.
Then they answered and said before the king, Daniel, who is of the sons of the captives from Judah, does not show due regard to you, O king, or the decree that you have signed, but he makes his petition three times a day.
Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased with himself, and he set his heart on Daniel, to deliver him. And he labored until the going down of the sun to deliver him.
Then these men met before the king and said to the king, O king, know that the law of the Medes and Persians is that no decree or law which the king establishes may be changed.
And the king commanded. And they brought Daniel, and they threw him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually will deliver you.
And a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den. And the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his nobles, that the matter concerning Daniel might not be changed.
Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.
Then the king rose up at dawn, at daybreak, and hurried to the den of lions.
And when he came to the den, he cried with a grieving voice to Daniel. The king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, your God whom you always serve, is He able to deliver you from the lions?
Then Daniel said to the king, O king, live forever!
My God has sent His Angel, and He has shut the mouths of the lions. And they have not harmed me, because in His sight innocence was found in me. And also before you, O king, I have done no harm.
Then the king was exceedingly glad over him. And he commanded to bring up Daniel from the den. And Daniel was brought out of the den, and no harm was found on him, because he trusted in his God.
And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel. And they threw them into the den of lions, them, their sons and their wives. And the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones before they ever reached the bottom of the den.
Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, the nations, and the languages who were living in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.
I make a decree, that in every domain of my kingdom there shall be trembling and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God and endures forever, and His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed. And His rule shall be to the end.
He delivers and rescues, and He works signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
So this Daniel was made to prosper in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main points.
Daniel spoke and said, In my vision by night I was looking. And, behold, the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the Great Sea.
And four great beasts came up from the sea, different from one another.
The first was like a lion and had eagle’s wings. I watched until its wings were plucked off. And it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.
And, behold, another beast, a second, like a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And they said this to it, Rise up, devour much flesh.
After this I was looking, and, behold, another like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird on its back. And also the beast had four heads. And dominion was given to it.
And after this I was looking in the night visions. And, behold, the fourth beast was frightening and terrifying, and very strong! And it had great iron teeth. It devoured, and broke in pieces, and stamped what was left with its feet. And it was different from all the beasts before it; and it had ten horns.
I was contemplating the horns. And behold, another little horn came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
I watched until the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days sat, whose robe was white as snow and the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was like flames of fire, its wheels like burning fire.
A stream of fire went out and came out from before Him. A thousand thousands served Him, and a vast innumerable number stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.
Then I was watching because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke. I was watching until the beast was killed, and his body was destroyed and given to the burning flame.
As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away. Yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
I saw in the night visions. And behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of the heavens. And He came to the Ancient of Days. And they brought Him near before Him.
And dominion was given to Him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
I, Daniel, was distressed in my spirit within my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
And I came near one of those who stood by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things.
These great beasts which are four, are four kings which shall rise up out of the earth.
But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.
Then I wanted to know the truth of the fourth beast, which was different from all of the others, very frightening, with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze; which devoured and broke in pieces, and trampled what was left with its feet,
also of the ten horns that were on its head, and the other which came up, and before whom three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.
I was watching, and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them,
until the Ancient of Days came. And judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
And he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be different from all other kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall trample it down and break it in pieces.
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings; they shall rise, and another shall rise after them. And he shall be different from the first, and he shall abase three kings.
And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall continually harass the saints of the Most High. And he shall intend to change times and law. And they shall be given into his hand for a period of a time and times and one half time.
But the court shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy until the end.
And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.
Thus far is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me much, and my countenance changed in me. But I kept the matter in my heart.
In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after that which appeared to me the first time.
And I saw in the vision, and it happened when I looked that I was at Shushan, the palace, which is in the province of Elam. And in the vision I saw that I was by the Ulai River.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked. And behold, a ram was standing before the river, having horns. And the horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
I saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward, so that no beasts could stand before him, and no one could deliver out of his hand. But he did according to his will and became great.
And as I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west, over the face of the whole earth and did not touch the ground. And the he goat had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.
And he came to the ram with the horns which I had seen standing before the river, and ran at him with furious power.
And I saw him come close to the ram. And he was enraged against him. And he struck the ram and broke his two horns. And there was no power in the ram to stand before him. But he threw him down to the ground and trampled him. And there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.
Then the male goat became very great. And when he became strong, the great horn was broken. And in its place came up four conspicuous ones toward the four winds of the heavens.
And out of one of them came a little horn which became very great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beautiful land.
And it became great, even to the host of the heavens. And it caused some of the host and of the stars to fall to the ground, and trampled them.
He magnified himself even to the Prince of the host. And the regular sacrifice was taken away by him, and the foundation of His sanctuary was cast down.
And a host was assigned to him against the regular sacrifice because of transgression. And he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered.
Then I heard a certain holy one speaking, and another holy one said to the one who spoke, For how long is the vision, concerning the regular sacrifice and the transgression of desolation, to permit both the holy place and the host to be trampled?
And he said to me, For two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings; then the holy place will be put right.
And it happened when I, Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought the understanding, that behold, one having the appearance of a man stood before me.
And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, and he called and said, Gabriel, make this one understand the vision.
And he came near where I stood. And when he came, I was afraid and fell on my face. But he said to me, O son of man, understand that the vision is about the time of the end.
And while he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face toward the ground. But he touched me, and stood me upright.
And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall happen at the time of the end of the indignation. For at the appointed time the end will come.
The ram which you saw with two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
And the male goat is the king of Greece. And the great horn between his eyes is the first king.
And as for that which was broken, and four stood up in its place, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in its power.
And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king shall stand forth, having fierce countenance and understanding sinister schemes.
And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power. And he shall destroy extraordinarily, and he shall prosper, and work, and destroy the mighty and the holy people.
And also through his cunning he will cause deceit to prosper in his hand. And he will magnify himself in his heart, and through prosperity shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against the Ruler of rulers, but he shall be broken in pieces without hands.
And the morning and evening vision that was told is true. But you shall close up the vision, for it is yet for many days.
And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days. Afterward, I got up and did the king’s business. And I was astonished at the vision, but did not understand it.
In the first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans,
in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood the number of the years by the books, from the Word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.
And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.
And I prayed to Jehovah my God, and made my confession, saying, O Lord, the great and awesome Mighty God, keeping the covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and with those who keep His commandments,
we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from Your commandments and from Your judgments.
And we have not heeded Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our rulers, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
O Lord, righteousness belongs to You, but to us the shame of face, as it is this day to the men of Judah, and to those living in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, who are near and who are afar in all the lands where You have driven them for their unfaithfulness which they have trespassed against You.
O Lord, shame of face belongs to us, to our kings, to our rulers and to our fathers, because we have sinned against You.
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveness, for we have rebelled against Him.
We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His laws which he set before us by His servants the prophets.
Yea, all Israel has transgressed Your Law and turned aside so as not to obey Your voice. For this reason the curse has poured out on us, and the oath that is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against Him.
And He has confirmed His Words which He spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing on us a great evil. For under the whole heavens it has never been done as has been done to Jerusalem.
As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this evil has come on us. Yet we did not make our prayer before Jehovah our God that we might turn from our depravities and understand Your truth.
And Jehovah has looked on the evil and has brought it upon us. For Jehovah our God is righteous in all His works which He does. For we did not obey His voice.
And now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and made for Yourself a name, as it is this day; we have sinned; we have done wickedly.
O Lord, I pray, according to all Your righteousness, let Your anger and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. For because of our sins and for our fathers’ iniquities, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all those around us.
And now, hear, O our God, the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary that is desolate, for the sake of the Lord.
O my God, bow down Your ear and hear; open Your eyes and see our desolations and the city which is called by Your name. For we do not make our supplications before You on account of our righteousness, but because of Your great mercies.
O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, give attention and act! Do not delay, for Your own sake, O my God. For Your city and Your people are called by Your name.
And while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and prostrating with my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God,
and while I was speaking in prayer, then the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, reached me as I was weary and faint, about the time of the evening sacrifice.
And he informed me and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill in understanding.
At the beginning of your prayers the word came forth, and I have come to explain it. For you are greatly beloved. Therefore consider the matter and understand the vision:
Seventy weeks are decreed regarding your people, and regarding your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make atonement for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.
Know, therefore, and understand that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem, to Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks and sixty two weeks. The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in times of distress.
And after sixty two weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself. And the people of a coming ruler shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end shall be with a flood, and desolations are determined, and there shall be war until the end.
And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week. And in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the grain offering to cease. And on a corner will be abominations that cause horror, even until the end. And that which was decreed shall be poured out on the desolate.
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar. And the word was true, but the appointed time was long. And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision.
In those days, I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.
I ate no pleasant food, and no flesh or wine came into my mouth. I did not anoint myself at all until three whole weeks were fulfilled.
And in the twenty fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris,
then I lifted up my eyes and looked: And behold, a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold from Uphaz.
His body was also like the beryl, and his face looked like lightning. And his eyes were like torches of fire; and his arms and his feet in color like polished bronze; and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude.
And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision. For the men who were with me did not see the vision. But a great trembling fell on them so that they fled to hide themselves.
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me. For my glory was turned within me into corruption, and I had no strength.
Yet I heard the sound of his words. And when I heard the sound of his words, then I was on my face, in a deep sleep, and my face was toward the ground.
And, behold, a hand touched me, which made me tremble in my knees and in the palms of my hands.
And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you and stand up, for I am now sent to you. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood, trembling.
And he said to me, Do not fear, Daniel. For from the first day that you set your heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. And I have come because of your words.
But the ruler of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days. But, lo, Michael, one of the chief rulers, came to help me; for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
Now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days. For the vision is yet for many days.
And when he had spoken such words to me, I turned my face to the ground, and I became speechless.
And, behold, one resembling the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said to him who stood before me, O my lord, my distress has overwhelmed me because of the vision, and I have no strength left.
For how can this servant of my lord speak with you my lord? For as for me, there is no strength left in me; nor is there breath left in me.
Then again, one resembling a man touched me and strengthened me.
And he said, O man greatly beloved, do not fear. Peace to you. Be strong. Yea, be strong! And when he had spoken to me I was strengthened. And I said, Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.
And he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the ruler of Persia. And when I have gone out, then indeed, the ruler of Greece shall come.
But I will tell you what is written in the Scripture of Truth. (And no one holds strong with me in these things, except Michael your ruler.
And I, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to strengthen and protect him.)
And now I will declare the truth to you: Behold, three more kings shall stand up in Persia; and the fourth shall be rich in all greater riches. And when he is strong through his riches, he shall stir up all against the kingdom of Greece.
And a mighty king shall stand up who shall rule with great authority and do according to his will.
And when he stands up his kingdom shall be broken in pieces and shall be divided to the four winds of the heavens, and not to his posterity, nor according to his authority with which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be plucked up and given to others besides these.
And the king of the south shall be strong. And one of his rulers, even he will gain strength over him, and he will rule. His dominion shall be a great dominion.
And at the end of years they shall join together, and the daughter of the king of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement. But she shall not retain the power of the arm. And he will not stand, nor his arm. But she and those who brought her shall be given up, as well as the one who begot her and who supported her in these times.
But out of the shoots of her roots one will stand in his place, and he shall come with an army and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north. And he will act against them and prevail.
And he will also bring their gods with their cast images, along with their possessions of silver and gold vessels, into captivity to Egypt. And he will continue more years than the king of the north.
And the king of the south will come into his kingdom and will return to his own land.
But his sons shall be stirred up and shall gather a multitude of great forces. And one certainly shall come and overflow and pass through. And he will return to his fortress and be stirred up.
And the king of the south will be bitter and will go out and fight with him, with the king of the north. And he shall raise a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into his hand.
And when he has carried away the multitude, his heart will be lifted up. And he will cause a vast innumerable number to fall, but he will not prevail.
For the king of the north shall return and raise a greater multitude than the former. And at the end of some years, he shall come to attack with a great army and with much equipment.
And in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south. And the sons of the violent ones of your people shall rise up to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.
So the king of the north shall come and build up a siege mound and seize a fortified city. And the forces of the south shall not stand, nor his choice people, for there will be no strength to resist.
But he who comes against him will do as he desires, and no one shall stand before him. And he shall stand in the glorious land, with destruction in his hand.
And he shall set his face to go in with the might of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do. And he shall give the daughter of women to him, to destroy it. But she shall not stand, nor be for him.
After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands and shall capture many. But a ruler shall make his reproach cease for him, but his reproach shall return to him.
And he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and not be found.
Then one who imposes taxes shall stand in his place, in the glorious kingdom. But within a few days he will be broken in pieces, but not in anger nor in battle.
And a vile person shall stand up in his place, and they shall not give to him the honor as king. But he shall come in with quietness and obtain the kingdom by intrigues.
And with the forces of the overflow they shall be swept from before him, and be broken, and also the ruler of the covenant.
And after they join themselves to him, he will practice deceit; for he shall come and shall be strong with a few people.
He will go in peaceably, even into the rich places of the province. And he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers. He shall plunder and spoil and scatter goods among them. And he shall devise his plots against the strongholds, even for a time.
And he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army. And the king of the south will be stirred up to battle with a great and very mighty army. But he shall not stand, for they will devise plots against him.
Yea, those who eat his food shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow. And many will fall down slain.
And both of these kings shall have it in their hearts to do evil, and they will speak lies at one table. But it will not prosper, for the end shall still be at the appointed time.
And he will return to his land with great wealth. And his heart shall be against the holy covenant. And he will act, and he shall return to his own land.
At the appointed time he will return and come against the south. But it will not be as the former or as the latter.
For ships from Kittim will come against him. And he will be grieved and return and be furious against the holy covenant. And he will act, and he will return and give heed to those who forsake the holy covenant.
And forces will stand for him, and they will profane the sanctuary fortress. And they shall remove the regular sacrifice, and they will place there the abomination that causes horror.
And he will corrupt with flatteries those who act wickedly against the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and will work.
And those who understand among the people will instruct many. Yet they will stumble by the sword and by flame, by captivity and spoils for many days.
And when they shall stumble, they will be helped with a little help. But many will join them with hypocrisy.
And some of those who understand shall stumble, to refine and to purge them, and to make them white, unto the time of the end; for it is yet for the appointed time.
And the king shall do according to his own will. And he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god; he shall even speak extraordinary things against the Mighty God of gods and shall prosper until the indignation is complete. For that which is decreed shall be done.
He shall not regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women; nor regard any god. For he shall magnify himself above them all.
But in his place he shall honor the god of fortresses, and he shall honor a god whom his fathers did not know, with gold and silver and with precious stones, and desirable things.
And he shall act in the strongholds of the fortresses with a foreign god, whom he shall acknowledge. He shall multiply in glory, and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain.
And at the time of the end, the king of the south will push against him. And the king of the north shall come against him like a tempest, with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships. And he shall go into the lands and shall overflow and pass through.
And he shall enter into the glorious land, and many will stumble. But these shall escape out of his hand: Edom and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
He will stretch out his hand against the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
But he will rule over the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt. And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.
But news from the east and from the north shall trouble him. And he will go out with great fury to utterly destroy and annihilate many.
And he shall plant his palace tents between the seas, in the glorious holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, and no one will help him.
And at that time, Michael shall stand up, the great ruler who stands for the sons of your people. And there shall be a time of distress, such as has not been since there was a nation until that time. And at that time, your people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the Book.
And many of those sleeping in the earth’s dust shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to reproach and everlasting abhorrence.
And the prudent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever.
But you, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, to the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.
And I, Daniel, looked. And behold, two others stood there, the one on this side, and one on that side of the river’s edge.
And one said to the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, How long will it be until the end of these wonders?
And I heard the man clothed in linen, who was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right and his left hand to the heavens and swore by Him who lives forever, that it shall be for a time, times, and a half. And when they have made an end of scattering the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
And I heard, but I did not understand. And I said, O my lord, what shall be the end of these things?
And he said, Go your way, Daniel! For the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
Many shall be purified and made white and tested, but the wicked shall do wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.
And from the time the regular sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that causes horror is set up, there shall be one thousand, two hundred and ninety days.
Blessed is he who waits and comes to the thousand, three hundred and thirty five days.
But you, go on to the end, for you shall rest and stand for your inheritance at the end of the days.
The Word of Jehovah that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.
The beginning of the Word of Jehovah by Hosea. And Jehovah said to Hosea, Go, take to yourself a wife of prostitution, and children of prostitution. For the land has committed adultery against Jehovah with great harlotry.
So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.
And Jehovah said to him, Call his name Jezreel, for yet in a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
And it shall be in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.
And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.
Yet I will have mercy on the house of Judah and will save them by Jehovah their God. And I will not save them by bow nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.
And when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
Then He said, Call his name Lo-ammi, for you are not My people, and I will not be your God.
Yet the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered. And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, it shall be said to them, you are Sons of the Living God.
And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and shall appoint over themselves one head. And they shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
Say to your brothers, A People; and to your sisters, Mercy.
Strive! Contend with your mother, for she is not My wife, nor am I her husband. Therefore, let her put away her harlotries from her presence, and her adulteries from between her breasts,
lest I strip her naked and set her out as in the day that she was born, and make her as the wilderness, and make her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.
And I will not have compassion on her sons, for they are the sons of harlotries.
For their mother has prostituted herself; she who conceived them has behaved shamefully. For she said, I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.
Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will close off her wall, so that she shall not find her paths.
And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not reach to them. And she shall seek them, but shall not find them. Then she shall say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now.
For she did not know that I gave her grain and wine and oil, and I multiplied her silver and the gold which they prepared for Baal.
Therefore I will return and take away My grain in its time, and My wine in its season. And I will take back My wool and My linen given to cover her nakedness.
And now I will uncover her lewdness in the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of My hand.
I will also put an end to all her joy, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.
And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me. And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals in which she burned incense to them. She even adorned herself with her nose rings, and her jewels, and she went after her lovers and forgot Me, says Jehovah.
Therefore, behold, I will seduce her and bring her into the wilderness, and speak to her heart.
And from there I will give her vineyards to her, and the Valley of Achor for a door of hope. And she shall respond there as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
And in that day, says Jehovah, you shall call Me, My Husband; and you shall no more call Me, My Master.
For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth; and they shall no more be remembered by their name.
And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and the creeping things of the ground. And I will break the bow and the sword, and the battle out of the earth, and I will make them lie down safely.
And I will betroth you to Me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness, and in justice, and in kindness, and in compassion.
I will even betroth you to Me in faithfulness. And you shall know Jehovah.
And it shall come to pass in that day that I will answer, says Jehovah. I will answer the heavens, and they shall respond to the earth.
And the earth shall respond with grain, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall answer Jezreel.
And I will sow her unto Me in the earth. And I will have mercy on No Mercy. And I will say to those who were Not My People, You are My people! And they shall say, You are My God!
And Jehovah said to me, Go again, love a woman loved by a companion, yet an adulteress, like the love of Jehovah toward the sons of Israel, who turn to other gods and love raisin cakes of grapes.
So I bought her for myself with fifteen pieces of silver, and with a homer and a half of barley.
And I said to her, You shall stay with me many days. You shall not be a harlot, nor be with another man, and I also will be for you.
For the sons of Israel shall remain many days without king or ruler, and without sacrifice, and without pillars, and without ephod or teraphim.
Afterward the sons of Israel shall return and seek Jehovah their God and David their king. And they shall fear Jehovah and His goodness in the latter days.
Hear the Word of Jehovah, you sons of Israel, for Jehovah has a complaint against the inhabitants of the land; for there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and the committing of adultery burst forth. And blood touches against blood.
On account of this the land shall mourn, and every one living there shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yes, even the fish of the sea shall be taken away.
Yet let no man strive with nor reprove another man. For your people are like those who strive with a priest.
Therefore you shall stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with you at night, and I will destroy your mother.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being priest to Me. Since you have forgotten the Law of your God, I also will forget your sons.
As they were increased, so they sinned against Me. I will change their glory into shame.
They eat up the sin of My people, and they set their appetites on their iniquity.
And it shall be: Like people, like priest. And I will visit their ways upon them and repay them for their deeds.
For they shall eat and not have enough. They shall commit fornication and not bring forth, because they have ceased to take heed to Jehovah.
Harlotry and wine and new wine snatch away the heart.
My people seek advice from their wooden idols, and their magic wand expounds to them. For the spirit of harlotry has led them astray, and they have committed adultery against their God.
They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinth, because their shade is good. On account of this, your daughters shall prostitute themselves, and your brides shall commit adultery.
I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves, nor your brides when they commit adultery. For the men themselves go aside with harlots, and they sacrifice with temple prostitutes. Therefore the people who do not understand will be thrust down.
Israel, though you commit fornication, do not let Judah become guilty. And do not come to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah lives.
For Israel rebels like a stubborn heifer. Now Jehovah will feed them as a lamb in a large area.
Ephraim is joined to idols. Let him alone.
Their drink is rebellion. They are continually committing fornication. Her defenders dearly love disgrace.
The wind binds her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
Hear this, O priests, and pay attention, O house of Israel. And give ear, O house of the king. For judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare to Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.
And revolters are deep in slaughter, though I chasten all of them.
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Ephraim, you have committed harlotry; Israel is defiled.
They do not devote their doings to turn back to their God. For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, and they do not know Jehovah.
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity. Judah shall also stumble with them.
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah, but they shall not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.
They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah, for they have brought forth strange sons. Now a new moon shall devour them with their heritage.
Blow the shofar in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Cry aloud at Beth-aven; after you, O Benjamin.
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I have made known that which is sure.
The rulers of Judah were like those who move borders; I will pour out My wrath on them like water.
Ephraim is oppressed and crushed in judgment, because he has willingly walked, keeping back from the commandments.
Therefore, I will be to Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Jareb. Yet he could not heal you, nor did he cure you of your wound.
For I am to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, tear and go away; I take away, and no one rescues.
I will go and return to My place until they confess their guilt and seek My face. In their affliction they will seek Me earnestly.
Come, and let us return to Jehovah. For He has torn, and He will heal us. He has stricken, and He will bind us up.
After two days He will restore us to life. In the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His presence.
Then we shall know, we who follow on to know Jehovah. His going forth is established as the dawn. And He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.
O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? For your goodness is like a morning cloud, and it goes away like the early dew.
Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the Words of My mouth; and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.
For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
But, like Adam, they have transgressed the covenant; they have dealt treacherously against Me there.
Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity, foot-tracked with blood.
And as bands of robbers lie in wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way, getting an early start at it; for they plot wickedness.
I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the harlotry of Ephraim; Israel is defiled.
Also, O Judah, a harvest is appointed for you, when I return the captives of My people.
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria. For they have dealt falsely; and a thief comes; a troop of robbers plunders outside.
And they do not consider within their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their own doings have surrounded them. They are before My face.
They make the king glad with their evil, and the rulers with their lies.
They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by the baker; he ceases from stirring after kneading the dough until it is leavened.
In the day of our king, the rulers have made themselves sick, inflamed with wine. He stretches out his hand with scorners.
For they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait. Their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns like a flaming fire.
They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges. All their kings have fallen; not one among them calls unto Me.
Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples. Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Strangers have eaten up his strength, yet he does not know it. Yea, gray hairs are sprinkled here and there on him, yet he does not know it.
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face. And they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek Him for all this.
Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart; they call to Egypt; they go to Assyria.
When they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens; I will chastise them, according to the report their congregation heard.
Woe to them! For they have fled from Me. Ruin to them! For they have transgressed against Me. Though I redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against Me.
And they have not cried to Me with their heart, when they wailed on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain and wine; they turn aside from Me.
Though I disciplined, I made their arms strong; yet they devise evil against Me.
They return, but not to the Most High. They are like a treacherous bow. Their rulers shall fall by the sword from the rage of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
Put the shofar to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed My covenant and have rebelled against My Law.
Israel shall cry to Me, My God, we know You.
Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
They have set up kings, but not by Me. They have made rulers, but I did not acknowledge it. They made idols for themselves with their silver and their gold, so that they may be cut off.
O Samaria, your calf has cast you off. My anger is kindled against them. How long until they attain to innocence?
For it was also from Israel: The craftsman made it, but it is not God. But the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
For they sow the wind, and they reap the whirlwind. It has no stalk; the bud shall yield no flour. If it should happen to produce, strangers will swallow it up.
Israel is swallowed up. They are now among the nations as a vessel in which is no pleasure.
For they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself. Ephraim has hired lovers.
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now I will gather them; and they shall begin to be few, because of the burden of the king of rulers.
Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, they are altars to him to sin.
I have written the great things of My Law for him, but they were counted as a strange thing.
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of My offerings, and they eat; but Jehovah does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins. They shall return to Egypt.
For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples. And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. But I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall burn up his palaces.
O Israel, do not rejoice for joy, like the peoples. For you have committed adultery against your God. You have loved for hire on every grain threshing floor.
The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
They shall not live in the land of Jehovah. But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
They shall not offer wine to Jehovah; they shall not be pleasing to Him. Their sacrifices shall be like the bread of sorrows to them; all who eat it shall be defiled, for their bread for their life shall not come into the house of Jehovah.
What will you do in the appointed day, and in the day of the feast of Jehovah?
For, lo, they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their valuables of silver; thorns shall be in their tents.
The days of visitation have come; the days of retribution have come. Israel shall know. The prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and your great hatred.
The watchman of Ephraim is with my God, but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways; hatred is in the house of his God.
They have deeply corrupted, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins.
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor and set themselves apart to that shameful thing. And they became an abomination like that which they loved.
The glory of Ephraim shall fly away like a bird; from birth, and from the womb, and from conception.
Though they raise their sons, yet I will make them childless, until not a man is left. Yea, woe also to them when I turn away from them!
As I watched Tyre, Ephraim was planted in a pleasant place. But Ephraim shall lead out his sons to the slayer.
O Jehovah, give them. What will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.
All their wickedness is in Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them out of My house because of the wickedness of their doings, I will love them no more; all their rulers are rebellious.
Ephraim is stricken; their root is dried up; they shall bear no fruit. Yea, though they bear, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.
My God shall cast them away because they did not give heed to Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.
Israel empties his vine; he bears fruit for himself. According to the abundance of his fruit he has increased the altars. They have made beautiful images according to the goodness of his land.
Their heart is divided. Now they shall be found guilty. He will break down their altars; He will destroy their images.
For now they shall say, We have no king, because we did not fear Jehovah. What then should a king do for us?
They have spoken words, swearing vanity in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field.
The inhabitants of Samaria shall dread because of the calves of Beth-aven. For its people shall mourn over it; also its priests shall tremble over it, over its glory, because it has departed from it.
It shall also be carried to Assyria, as a present to King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
Samaria is cut off; her king is like a twig on the water.
Also, the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle shall grow up over their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us!
O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they stood. The battle against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them in Gibeah.
When it is My desire, I shall chasten them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they bind themselves to their two transgressions.
And Ephraim is a trained heifer, loving to tread grain. But I passed over her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break clods for him.
Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in kindness. Break up your fallow ground. For it is time to seek Jehovah, until He comes and rains righteousness on you.
You have plowed wickedness; you have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies because you trusted in your own way, in the multitude of your mighty men.
Therefore an uproar shall rise up among your people. And all your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in pieces upon her sons.
Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, because of your great wickedness. At dawn, the king of Israel shall be completely cut off.
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and I called My Son out of Egypt.
As they called to them, so they went from them. They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to graven images.
I also taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms. But they did not know that I healed them.
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love. And I was to them as those who lift off the yoke from their jaws; and I held out food to them.
He shall not return to the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to come back.
And the sword shall whirl about in his cities, and shall bring to an end his isolated districts, and shall consume them, because of their own counsels.
And My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High, no one at all exalts Him.
How shall I give you up, Ephraim? Shall I deliver you up, Israel? How shall I make you like Admah? Shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart churns within Me; My compassions are kindled together.
I will not execute My burning anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim. For I am the Mighty God, and not a man, the Holy One in your midst. And I will not enter into the city with terror.
They shall walk after Jehovah; He shall roar like a lion. When He roars, then His sons shall tremble from the west.
They shall tremble as a bird from Egypt, and as a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will make them live in their houses, says Jehovah.
Ephraim circles around Me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful with the saints.
Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind; all the day he multiplies lies and ruin. And they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
Jehovah also has a quarrel with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds.
He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he contended with God.
Yes, he wept and pleaded with Him, and he contended with the Angel and prevailed. He found Him at Bethel, and He spoke with us there,
even Jehovah the God of Hosts. Jehovah is His memorial.
Therefore return to your God; keep kindness and justice, and wait for your God continually.
He is a merchant; the scales of deceit are in his hand; he loves to oppress.
And Ephraim said, I am rich; I have found much wealth for myself. In all my labors they shall find no iniquity in me that is sin.
But I am Jehovah your God ever since the land of Egypt; I will again make you live in tents, as in the days of the appointed feasts.
I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and used parables by the hand of the prophets.
Is Gilead evil? Surely they are vanity. They sacrificed bulls in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
And Jacob fled into the land of Syria, and Israel served for a wife; yea, he kept sheep for a wife.
And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was protected.
Ephraim has provoked Him to anger most bitterly. Therefore He shall leave the guilt of his blood upon him, and his Lord shall return his reproach unto him.
When Ephraim spoke, trembling, he was lifted up in Israel. But when he trespassed through Baal, he died.
And now they sin more and more, and they have made themselves molten images of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen. They say of them, Let the men who sacrifice kiss the calves.
Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passes away, as chaff driven from the threshing floor by the storm, and as smoke out of the chimney.
Yet I am Jehovah your God, ever since the land of Egypt; and you shall know no other gods but Me. For there is no Savior besides Me.
I have known you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
When they had pasture, they were filled. They were filled, and their heart was exalted. Therefore they have forgotten Me.
Now I am like a lion to them; I will watch by the way like a leopard.
I will meet them like a bereaved bear, and I will tear open the carcass to their heart; and like a lion, I will devour them there; the beasts of the field shall tear them.
O Israel, you are destroyed, but your help is in Me.
Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities? And where are your judges to whom you said, Give to me a king and rulers?
I gave you a king in My anger, and took him away in My fury.
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is treasured up.
The pangs of a woman giving birth shall come upon him; he is an unwise son, for he does not stay long where children are born.
I will ransom them from the hand of Sheol; I will redeem them from death. O death, where are your plagues? O Sheol, where is your destruction? Sorrow is hidden from My eyes.
Though he is fruitful among brothers, an east wind shall come. The wind of Jehovah shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall be disappointed because his fountain shall be dried up. He shall plunder the treasure of all desirable vessels.
Samaria is held guilty, for she has rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword, their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped open.
O Israel, return to Jehovah your God, for you have stumbled by your iniquity.
Take words with you and return to Jehovah. Say to Him, Take away all iniquity and receive us with grace, that we may repay with the calves of our lips.
Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride on horses. We shall not say any more to the work of our hands, You are our gods! For in You the fatherless finds mercy.
I will heal their backslidings; I will love them freely; for My anger has turned away from him.
I will be as the dew to Israel; he shall blossom as the lily and thrust forth his roots like Lebanon.
His branches shall spread out, and his beauty shall be like the olive tree, and his scent as Lebanon.
They who live under his shadow shall return; they shall live like the grain, and blossom like the vine; their remembrance shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard and observed him. I am as a green cypress tree; your fruit is found in Me.
Who is wise and discerns these things? Who is discerning and knows them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the righteous shall walk in them; but transgressors shall stumble in them.
The Word of Jehovah that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:
Hear this, you old men, and give ear, all you inhabitants of the land. Has this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
Tell your sons about it, and your sons to their sons, and their sons to another generation.
What was left by the chewing locust, the swarming locust ate; and that left by the swarming locust, the locust larvae ate; and that left by the locust larvae, the consuming locust ate.
Awake, you drunkards, and weep. And wail, all you wine drinkers, because of the new wine, for it is cut off from your mouth.
For a nation has come up against My land, strong and without number; its teeth are the teeth of a lion, and it has the fangs of a lioness.
He has made My vine desolation, and he has splintered My fig tree. He has stripped it bare, and thrown it down; its branches grow white.
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
The food offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of Jehovah; the priests, Jehovah’s ministers, mourn.
The field is wasted; the land mourns, for the grain is wasted. The new wine is dried up, the oil tree droops.
Be dried up, you farmers, howl, you vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field has perished.
The vine is dried up and the fig tree droops, the pomegranate, and the palm tree, and the apple tree; all the trees of the field are dried up, because joy has dried up from the sons of men.
Gird yourselves and lament, you priests. Howl, you ministers of the altar. Come, spend the night in sackcloth, you who serve my God. For the food offering and the drink offering are held back from the house of your God.
Consecrate a fast; call a solemn assembly; gather the elders, all the inhabitants of the land, into the house of Jehovah your God, and cry unto Jehovah.
Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah is at hand. And it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.
Is not the food cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?
The seed shrivels under their clods; the storehouses are laid waste, the granaries are broken down, for the grain has dried up.
How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture. Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment.
O Jehovah, to You I will cry, for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and has burned all the trees of the field.
The beasts of the field also pant after You, for the rivers of water are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
Blow the shofar in Zion, and shout an alarm in My holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble. For the day of Jehovah approaches, it is near;
a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread out on the mountains, a great and a strong people. There has never been the like, nor shall there ever be again to the years of many generations;
a fire devours before them, and a flame burns behind them. The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them is a desolate wilderness; yea, also nothing shall escape them.
Their appearance is like horses; and as horsemen, so they run.
They leap on the tops of the mountains with a sound like chariots, like the sound of flames of fire that devour the chaff, as a strong people set in battle array.
Before their face the people writhe in pain; all faces gather heat.
They run like mighty ones; they go up the wall as men of war. And they each go on his way, and they do not break ranks.
And each does not press his brother; they each go in their own paths. And if they fall behind their weapon, they are not cut off.
They run to and fro in the city; they run on the wall; they climb up on the houses; they enter in by the windows, like a thief.
The earth quakes before them, the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars withdraw their brightness.
And Jehovah gives His voice before His army, for His camp is very great. For he who does His Word is strong. For the day of Jehovah is very great and terrifying, and who can endure it?
Yet even now turn to Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning, declares Jehovah.
So, tear your heart, and not your garments; and return to Jehovah your God. For He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and He has compassion concerning the evil.
Who knows if He will turn and have pity and leave a blessing behind Him, a food offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God?
Blow the shofar in Zion, consecrate a fast, call a solemn assembly.
Gather the people, consecrate the assembly, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those who suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go out of his chamber, and the bride out of her room.
Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar; and let them say, Have compassion on Your people, O Jehovah, and do not give Your possession to reproach, that the nations should rule over them. Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?
Then Jehovah will be jealous for His land and have pity on His people.
Yea, Jehovah will answer and say to His people, Behold, I will send you grain, and wine, and oil, and you shall be satisfied with it. And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
But I will remove the northern army far from you, and I will drive him into a dry and desolate land with his face toward the eastern sea, and his back toward the western sea. And his stench shall come up, and his foul odor shall rise, because he did things to magnify himself.
Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice, for Jehovah will do things to magnify Himself.
Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness grow green, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and the vine yield their strength.
Be glad then, you sons of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God. For He has given to you the early rain according to righteousness, and He will cause the rain to come down for you, the early rain and the latter rain in the first month.
And the threshing floors shall be full with grain, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
And I will restore to you the years which the swarming locust has eaten, the locust larvae, and the consuming locust, and the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you.
And you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied; and you shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And My people shall never be be put to shame.
And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is no other. And My people shall never be put to shame.
And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh. And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.
And also I will pour out My Spirit on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days.
And I will show signs in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of Jehovah.
And it shall be, that whoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall escape. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as Jehovah has said, and among the survivors whom Jehovah shall call.
For, behold, in those days and in that time, when I bring back again the captives of Judah and Jerusalem,
I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on account of My people and My possession, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations; and divided up My land.
And they have cast lots for My people. And have given a boy as payment for a prostitute and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.
And also, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you restore a recompense to Me? And if you are dealing out to Me, I will return your dealings upon your own head, swiftly, speedily,
because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried My desirable good things to your temples.
You have also sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you might remove them far from their borders.
Behold, I will arouse them from the place where you have sold them, and will return your dealings upon your own head.
And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off. For Jehovah has spoken.
Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate a war; wake up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, I am strong.
Assemble yourselves and come, all you nations; and gather yourselves together all around. O Jehovah, bring down Your mighty ones.
Let the nations be awakened and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. For there I will sit to judge all the nations all around.
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Come, go down, for the press is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision.
The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their brightness.
Jehovah roars from Zion, and He utters His voice from Jerusalem. And the heavens and the earth quake. But Jehovah is a refuge for His people and a fortress to the sons of Israel.
And you shall know that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and foreigners shall no more pass through her.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drip with new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the ravines of Judah shall flow with waters. And a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and it shall water the valley of Shittim.
Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, whose innocent blood they poured out in their land.
But Judah will dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
For I will acquit them of the guilt of blood which I had not acquitted; for Jehovah dwells in Zion.
The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.

But I will send a fire against the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.
Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for he pursued his brother with the sword, and dealt corruptly regarding mercy, and his anger tore continually, and he kept his wrath forever.

Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, that they might make their border larger.

And their king shall go into captivity, he and his rulers together, says Jehovah.

And I will cut off the judge in its midst, and will kill all its rulers with him, says Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it; for they despised the Law of Jehovah, and they have not kept His statutes. And their lies after which their fathers walked led them astray.
And I will send a fire against Judah, which shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
Thus says Jehovah: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn back from punishing it, for they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals.
They pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the helpless, and thrust aside the way of the afflicted. And a man and his father go in to the same girl, in order to profane My holy name.
And they lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge, and drink the wine of those being punished in the house of their God.
Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was as strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath.
Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you in the wilderness forty years, to possess the land of the Amorite.
And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Is this not even so, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah.
But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and you commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.
Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart full of sheaves is pressed.
Therefore flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his power, nor shall the mighty deliver his life,
and he who handles the bow shall not stand, and the swift of foot shall not escape, nor shall the one riding a horse deliver his soul.
And the strong of heart among the mighty shall flee naked in that day, declares Jehovah.
Hear this Word that Jehovah has spoken against you, O sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:
You only have I known of all the families of the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.
Can two walk together except they are agreed?
Will a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him? Will a young lion cry out of his den unless he has caught something?
Will a bird fall into a trap on the ground, where there is no bait for it? Will a trap spring up from the ground, and it has caught nothing at all?
If a shofar is blown in a city, will the people not also tremble? If there is calamity in a city, will not even Jehovah have done it?
Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets.
A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken! Who can but prophesy?
Proclaim in the palaces in Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Gather yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see great tumults in its midst, and oppressions in its midst.
For they do not know to do right, declares Jehovah, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.
Therefore the Lord Jehovah says this: An enemy shall be all around the land. And he shall bring down your strength from you, and your fortresses shall be plundered.

Come to Bethel and transgress; multiply transgression at Gilgal; and bring your sacrifices every morning, your tithes every third year;
and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven; cry out, call out the free-will offerings! For so you love to do, O sons of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places; and you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.
And I have also withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest. And I caused rain to fall on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city. One parcel of land was rained on, and the parcel where it did not rain was dried up.
So two or three cities staggered to one city in order to drink water, but they were not satisfied; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.
I have struck you with blasting and mildew. When your gardens and your vineyards, and your figs, and your olives increased, the locust devoured them; yet you have not returned to Me, declares Jehovah.

For, behold, He who forms mountains and creates the wind and declares to man what his thought is, He who makes the dawn darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth; Jehovah the God of Hosts, is His name.
Hear this word which I am taking up against you, a lamentation, O house of Israel.
The virgin of Israel has fallen, and will not rise again; she lies forsaken on her land; there is no one to raise her up.
For thus says the Lord Jehovah, The city that goes out by a thousand shall have a hundred left. And that which goes out by a hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.
For thus says Jehovah to the house of Israel, Seek Me, and live.
But do not seek Bethel, and do not enter Gilgal, and do not cross over to Beer-sheba; for Gilgal shall be exiled into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.
Seek Jehovah, and live, that He not break out like a fire on the house of Joseph, and consume it, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel;
you who turn justice into wormwood, and lay righteousness to rest on the earth.
He who made the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the deep darkness into morning, and darkens the day into night; who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the face of the earth, Jehovah is His name;
who bursts out with destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress.
They hate him who rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks uprightly.
So, therefore because you trample on the poor, and you take tribute of grain from him; you have built houses of hewn stones, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted desirable vineyards, but you shall not drink wine from them.
For I know your many transgressions, and your many sins: afflicting the just, taking bribes, and thrusting away the poor from justice in the gate.
Therefore the prudent shall keep silent at that time, for it is an evil time.
Seek good and not evil, that you may live; and thus Jehovah the God of Hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken.
Hate evil, and love good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that Jehovah the God of Hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.
Therefore Jehovah the God of Hosts, the Lord, says this: There shall be wailing in all the streets, and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! Alas! And they shall call the farmer to the mourning, and those that are skilled in wailing to lamentation.
And there shall be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass among you, says Jehovah.
Woe to those who desire the day of Jehovah! Of what good is this to you? The day of Jehovah is darkness, and not light.
It is as if a man fled before a lion, and a bear met him. Or he goes into the house and leans his hand against the wall, and a snake bites him.
Is not the day of Jehovah darkness, and not light; even very dark, and not any brightness in it?
I hate, I despise your feast days; and I will not savor your solemn assemblies.
Though you offer Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings, I will not be pleased; nor will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.
Take away from Me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your lutes.
But let justice flow down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
Have you drawn near with sacrifices and food offerings to Me forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
Indeed, you have borne the tabernacle of your king, and Chiun your images, the star of your gods, which you made for yourselves!
Therefore I will exile you beyond Damascus, says Jehovah, whose name is God of Hosts.
Woe to those at ease in Zion, and those trusting in the mountain of Samaria, noted as chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came.
Cross over to Calneh and see; and from there go to the great Hamath; then go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are they better than these kingdoms, or their border than your border?
You who put the evil day far away, and cause the seat of violence to come near,
who lie on beds of ivory and stretch themselves on their couches; and those eating the lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall;
who chant with the sound of the lute; they invent instruments of song for themselves like David;
who drink wine from bowls, and anoint themselves with the best of ointments; but they are not grieved for the crushing of Joseph!
Therefore they shall go into captivity with the first of the captives, and the feast of those who recline shall come to an end.
The Lord Jehovah has sworn by Himself, declares Jehovah the God of Hosts: I abhor the pride of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore I will deliver up the city and its fullness.
And it shall come to pass, if ten men remain in one house, that they shall die.
And when a man’s uncle shall take him away, and he who burns the bodies, to bring out the bones from the house; and he shall say to the one left in the recesses of the house, Are there any still with you? And he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Keep quiet! For we must not mention the name of Jehovah.
For, behold, Jehovah gives a command, and He will strike the great house into pieces, and the little house with cracks.
Shall horses run on the rock? Or will one plow there with oxen? For you have turned justice into poison, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood,
those rejoicing for nothing; who say, Have we not taken horns to ourselves by our own strength?
For, behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel, declares Jehovah the God of Hosts. And they shall oppress you from the entrance of Hamath to the valley of the wilderness.
The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, He formed locusts at the beginning of the after growth; indeed, the after growth after the mowings of the king.
And so it was that when they had made an end of eating the vegetation of the land, then I said, Lord Jehovah, I pray, forgive. How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.
Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says Jehovah.
The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire. And it consumed the great deep, and devoured part of it.
Then I said, Lord Jehovah, I beg You, stop. How can Jacob rise up? For he is small.
Jehovah was moved to compassion concerning this: It shall not be, says the Lord Jehovah.
He showed me this: And, behold, the Lord stood by a plumb lined wall, with a plumb line in His hand.
And Jehovah said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. Then the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumb line in the midst of My people Israel. I will not again pass over him any more.
And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to Jeroboam, the king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to endure all his words.
For thus Amos says: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be exiled into captivity out of their land.
And Amaziah said to Amos, Seer, go! Flee into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there.
But do not again prophesy at Bethel any more, for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal house.
Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was not a prophet, nor was I the son of a prophet, but I was a herdsman and one gathering sycamore fruit.
And Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.
Now, therefore, hear the Word of Jehovah: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel, and do not drop words against the house of Isaac.
Therefore thus says Jehovah, Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a survey line. And you shall die in a defiled land. And Israel shall be exiled into captivity from his land.
The Lord Jehovah showed me this: And, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. And Jehovah said to me, The end has come upon My people Israel; I will not again pass over him any more.
And the songs of the temple will be howling in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah. Many dead bodies everywhere; and they shall throw them out in silence.
Hear this, you who swallow up the needy, and make the poor of the land to fail,
saying, When will the new moon have passed, so that we may buy grain? Or the sabbath, so that we may open the wheat; making the ephah smaller, and making the shekel greater, and falsifying the balances by deceit,
in order to buy the poor with silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, and sell the refuse of the wheat?
Jehovah has sworn by the Pride of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.
Shall not the land tremble for this, and everyone who dwells in it mourn? And all of it shall rise like the light, and it shall overflow and sink like the river of Egypt.
And it shall be in that day, declares the Lord Jehovah, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the light of day.
And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation. And I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head. And I will make it like the mourning for an only one; and the end of it like a bitter day.
Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine into the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but rather a famine for hearing the Words of Jehovah.
And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall roam to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah, and they shall not find it.
In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men shall faint with thirst.
They who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As your god lives, O Dan! and, As the way of Beer-sheba lives! even they shall fall, and never rise again.
I saw the Lord standing by the altar. And He said, Strike the capital of the door, and the thresholds will shake; and cut them off on the head of all of them. And I will kill the last of them with the sword. Not one of them who flees will get away, and not a fugitive of them will escape.
Even if they dig through into Sheol, from there My hand will take them. And if they ascend up to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.
And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out from there. Even if they hide from My eyes in the bottom of the sea, from there I will command the serpent, and he will bite them.
And though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. And I will set My eyes on them for evil, and not for good.
And the Lord Jehovah of Hosts is He who touches the earth so that it melts, and all who dwell in it shall mourn. And all of it will rise up like the River, and sink down like the River of Egypt.
He who builds His stairs in the heavens, and His firmament He has established, binding it to the earth; He who calls for the seawaters and pours them out on the face of the earth; Jehovah is His name.
Are you not like the sons of Cush to Me, O sons of Israel? declares Jehovah. Have I not brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?
Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth; except that, I will not utterly annihilate the house of Jacob, declares Jehovah.
For, behold, I will command, and I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations, as one sifts with a sieve; yet not a grain shall fall to the ground.
All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, those who say, The evil shall not draw near or come upon us.
In that day I will raise up the covert of David that has fallen, and I will wall up its breaks. And I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;
so that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by My name, declares Jehovah who does this.
Behold, the days are coming, declares Jehovah, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him who drags along seed. And the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and all the hills will flow with it.
And I will bring back the captives of My people Israel. And they shall build the waste cities, and live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them. They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall never again be pulled up out of their land which I have given to them, says Jehovah your God.
The vision of Obadiah: Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom: We have heard a report from Jehovah, and a messenger is sent among the nations; rise up, and let us rise up against her for battle.
Behold, I have made you small among the nations; you are greatly despised.
The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who dwell in the clefts of the rock; whose dwelling is high, saying in your heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
Though you rise as high as the eagle, and though you set your nest among the stars, I will bring you down from there, declares Jehovah.
If thieves had come to you, if robbers by night (O, how you will be cut off!), would they not have stolen until they had enough? If the grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?
O, how Esau is searched out! His hidden things are sought out!
All the men of your covenant have sent you away to the border. The men who were at peace with you have deceived you and have prevailed against you. They are setting your bread as a trap under you; no one is aware of it.
Shall I not in that day even destroy the wise out of Edom and understanding out of the mountains of Esau? declares Jehovah.
And your mighty ones, O Teman, shall be afraid, so that each man from the mountains of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
Shame shall cover you because of your violence against your brother Jacob, and you shall be cut off forever.
In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers took captive his forces, and foreigners entered his gates, and cast lots for Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.
But you should not have looked on the day of your brother, on the day of his destruction; nor should you have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day of their destruction; nor should you have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
You should not have entered into My people’s gate in the day of his calamity; also you should not have looked on his evil in the day of his calamity, nor should you have sent away his forces in the day of his calamity.
Nor should you have stood at the crossroads to cut off those of him who escaped, nor should you have delivered up his survivors to prison in the day of distress.
For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations: As you have done, it shall be done to you; your recompense shall return upon your own head.
For as you have drunk on My holy mountain, so shall all the nations continually drink. Yea, they shall drink and shall swallow; and they shall be as though they had never been.
But on Mount Zion there shall be deliverance, and it shall be holy. And the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions.
And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble. And they shall burn among them and consume them. And there shall be no survivor to the house of Esau, for Jehovah has spoken.
And those from the south shall possess the mountain of Esau, and the low lands of the Philistines. And they shall possess the fields of Ephraim and Samaria. And Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel shall possess the land of the Canaanites to Zarephath; even the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad shall possess the cities of the south.
And deliverers shall go up into Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom shall be Jehovah’s.
Now the Word of Jehovah came to Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying,
Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry out against it; for their evil has come up before Me.
But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah. And he went down to Joppa, and he found a ship going to Tarshish. And he paid its fare and went down into it in order to go with them to Tarshish, from the presence of Jehovah.
But Jehovah hurled a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that they thought the ship would break in pieces.
And the sailors were afraid, and each man cried to his god. And they threw out the ship’s implements into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship; and he lay down, and was sound asleep.
And the captain came near to him and said to him, What is this, O sleeper? Rise up and cry out to your God! Perhaps your God will think on us, and we will not perish.
And they said one to another, Come and let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.
And they said to him, Please tell us on account of whom is this evil upon us? What is your occupation? And from where do you come? What is your land, and of what people are you?
And he said to them, I am a Hebrew. And I fear Jehovah the God of Heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.
Then the men were terrified with great fear and said to him, What is this you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Jehovah, because he had told them.
Then they said to him, What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us? For the sea was going on and being stormy.
And he said to them, Take me up and throw me out into the sea. And the sea will be calm for you. For I know that this great storm is upon you because of me.
Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, but they were not able, for the sea was going on and being stormy against them.
Therefore they cried out to Jehovah, and said, We beseech You, O Jehovah, we beseech You, do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not lay innocent blood on us. For You, O Jehovah, have done as it pleased You.
And they lifted Jonah up and threw him into the sea. And the sea ceased from its raging.
Then the men revered Jehovah with great fear and offered a sacrifice to Jehovah, and vowed vows.
Now Jehovah had appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God out of the belly of the fish.
And he said, I cried out to Jehovah because of my distress, and He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help, and You heard my voice.
For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the streams surrounded me; all Your breakers and Your waves passed over me.
And I said, I am cast off from Your sight; yet I will again look to Your holy temple.
Waters encompassed me, even to my soul; the depth closed around me; seaweed was wrapped around my head.
I went down to the bases of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me forever. Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; and my prayer came to You, to Your holy temple.
Those who observe empty vanities forsake their faithfulness;
but I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will make good that which I have vowed. Salvation is from Jehovah!
And Jehovah spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out onto the dry land.
And the Word of Jehovah came to Jonah the second time, saying,
Rise up, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry out to it the proclamation that I am instructing you.
And Jonah rose up and went to Nineveh according to the Word of Jehovah. And Nineveh was a great city before God, of three days’ journey.
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey. And he cried out and said, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown!
And the men of Nineveh believed in God, and they called a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
And the word reached even to the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he took off his robe and covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes.
And he cried and proclaimed in Nineveh by the decree of the king and of his nobles, saying, Do not let man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them feed nor let them drink water.
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. And let them call mightily to God. And let them each one turn from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.
Who knows if God may turn, and have compassion, and turn away from His burning anger, that we not perish?
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way. And God was moved to pity with regard to the evil that He had spoken to do to them, and He did not do it.
But it was a great evil in Jonah’s eyes, and he trembled and became furious.
And he prayed to Jehovah, and said, Please, O Jehovah, was this not my word while I was still in my own country? On account of this, I fled to Tarshish before, for I knew that You are a gracious Mighty God and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and One who is moved to pity regarding inflicting evil.
And now, O Jehovah, please take my life from me. For it is better for me to die than to live.
And Jehovah said, Is it right for you to be angry?
And Jonah went out from the city and sat to the east of the city. And there he made a booth for himself and sat under it in the shade until he should see what would become of the city.
And Jehovah God appointed a plant, and it came up over Jonah to be shade over his head, in order to deliver him from his misery. And Jonah rejoiced over the plant with great joy.
But God appointed a worm early as the next day dawned, and it struck the plant, and it withered.
And it happened when the sun rose, that God appointed a scorching east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he fainted; and he begged for his soul to die. And he said, It is better for me to die than to live.
And God said to Jonah, Is it right for you to be angry over the plant? And he said, It is right for me to be angry, even to death.
Then Jehovah said, You have had pity on the plant for which you did not labor, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night;
and should I not have pity on Nineveh, the great city in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between the right and the left hand, and many cattle?
The Word of Jehovah that came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem:
Hear, all you people. Take heed, O earth, and all the fullness of it. And let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against you, the Lord from His holy temple.
For behold, Jehovah is coming out of His place, and He will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.
And the mountains shall melt under Him, and the valleys shall burst open, as wax before the fire, as waters poured out on a steep place.
All this is against the transgression of Jacob, and against the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria. And what are the high places of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem.
Therefore I will make Samaria into a ruinous heap of the field, places for planting a vineyard. And I will pour down her stones into the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.
And all her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her wages of harlotry shall be burned with fire. And I will make all her idols a desolation. For she gathered it from the wages of a harlot, and they shall return to the wages of a harlot.
Therefore I will wail and howl; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning like the daughters of the owl.
For her wounds are incurable; for it has come to Judah; it has reached to the gate of my people, to Jerusalem.
Do not declare it in Gath; do not weep and wail. In Beth Aphrah roll and wallow in dust.
Pass over, you inhabitant of Shaphir, having your shame naked. The inhabitant of Zaanan has not gone out; Beth Ezel mourns; its standing place is taken from you.
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited anxiously for good, but evil came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.
O inhabitant of Lachish, harness the chariot to the swift steeds; she is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
Therefore you shall give parting gifts to Moresheth Gath. The houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
Yet I will bring an heir to you, O inhabitant of Mareshah. The glory of Israel shall come unto Adullam.
Make yourself bald, and cut off your hair for your dainty children. Enlarge your baldness like the eagle, for they have gone from you into exile.
Woe to those who devise wickedness and do evil on their beds! In the morning light they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.
And they covet and seize fields and houses, and carry them away. And they oppress a man and his household, even a man and his inheritance.
Therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I am devising evil against this family, from which you shall not remove your necks; nor shall you walk haughtily, for this is an evil time.
In that day one shall take up a parable against you and wail a mournful lamentation, saying, We are devastated in utter ruin. He has changed the possession of my people. How He has removed it from me! To the turncoat He has divided the fields.
Therefore you will not have one to cast a measuring line by lot in the assembly of Jehovah.
Do not prophesy as you prophesy, you say. So they shall not prophesy to you; they shall not take away reproaches.
You who are named House of Jacob, is the Spirit of Jehovah limited? Are these His doings? Do not My Words do good to the one who walks uprightly?
Even recently My people have risen up like an enemy. You strip off an inner robe before an outer garment, from those who pass by securely, as those returning from war.
You have thrown the women of My people out from their pleasant houses; you have taken away My honor forever from their children.
Rise up and depart. This is not your rest, for it is unclean. It shall destroy with grievous destruction.
If a man walks with a spirit of deception and lies saying, I will prophesy to you for wine and for strong drink, he shall even be a prophet for this people.
I will collect and gather all of you, O Jacob; I will collect and gather the remnant of Israel. I will set them together like the sheep of the fold, like a flock in the middle of their pasture. They shall be in commotion because of the multitude of people.
The one who breaks through comes before them; they break through and pass through the gate and go out by it. And their king shall pass before them, and Jehovah at their head.
And I said, Hear now, O heads of Jacob, and you rulers of the house of Israel; is it not for you to know justice.
You who hate good and love evil, who tear their skin off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
who also eat the flesh of My people, and flay their skin off from them; and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh in the kettle.
Then they shall cry out to Jehovah, but He will not answer them. He will even hide His face from them at that time, because they have done evil in their doings.
Thus says Jehovah concerning the prophets who mislead My people, who bite with their teeth and call out, Peace! And whoever does not put anything into their mouth, they even prepare a war against him.
Therefore the night shall be to you without vision; and darkness without divining. And the sun shall go down on the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded, all of them; yea, they shall cover their mustache, for there is no answer from God.
But by the Spirit of Jehovah I am full of power and justice and might, to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, you who abhor justice and pervert all equity,
who build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity:
Her heads judge for a bribe, and her priests teach for pay, and her prophets divine for money; yet they lean on Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah among us? No evil can come upon us.
Therefore, on account of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the high places of the forest.
But it shall be in the latter days, that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established on the top of the mountains; and it shall be lifted up above the hills; and peoples shall flow to it.
And many nations shall come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob. And He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. For the Law shall go forth out of Zion, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.
And He shall judge between many peoples, and will decide for strong nations afar off. And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nor shall they learn war any more.
But they shall each one sit under his vine and under his fig tree, and there shall be no cause for trembling. For the mouth of Jehovah of Hosts has spoken.
For all the peoples walk, each one in the name of his god; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.
In that day I will gather the lame, declares Jehovah, and I will gather the banished, and the ones I have afflicted.
And I will establish the lame in a place as a remnant, and her who was cast off into a strong nation. And Jehovah shall reign over them in Mount Zion from now on, even forever.
And you, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, it shall come to you. And the rule of the chief ones shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
Now why do you cry aloud with an outcry? Is there no king among you? Has your adviser perished? For pangs have seized you like one in travail.
Writhe in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like one giving birth. For now you shall go out from the city, and you shall live in the field. And you shall go to Babylon. There you shall be delivered. There Jehovah shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.
Now also many nations are gathered against you, saying, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes look upon Zion.
But they do not know the purposes of Jehovah, nor do they understand His counsel. For He will gather them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.
Rise up and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hooves bronze, and you shall crush many peoples. And I will consecrate their gain to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
Now gather yourself together in troops, O daughter of troops; he has laid siege against us. They shall strike the Judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.
And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are insignificant among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.
Therefore He will give them up until the time the one giving birth has given birth. Then the remnant of His brothers shall return to the sons of Israel.
And He shall stand and feed His flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah His God. And they shall dwell, for now He shall be great to the ends of the earth.
And this shall be peace. When Assyria shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then we shall raise against him seven shepherds and eight anointed men.
And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at the entrances. Thus He shall deliver us from Assyria, when he comes into our land, and when he treads within our borders.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah, as showers on the grass, which does not wait for man, nor delay for the sons of men.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who both tramples and tears in pieces if he passes through, and there is no one to deliver.
Your hands shall be raised against your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut off.
And it shall be in that day, that I will cut off your horses out of your midst, and I will destroy your chariots, declares Jehovah.
And I will cut off the cities of your land and tear down all your fortresses.
And I will cut off sorceries out of your hand, and there shall not be any more conjurers.
And I will also cut off your graven images and your pillars from your midst. And you shall no more bow down to the work of your hands.
And I will pluck your groves from your midst, and I will destroy your cities.
And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury on the nations, such as they have not heard.
Hear now what Jehovah says: Rise up, contend with the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.
Mountains, and you enduring foundations of the earth, hear the contention of Jehovah, for Jehovah has a quarrel with His people, and He will argue with Israel.
O My people, what have I done to you? And how have I made you weary? Testify against Me.
For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage; and I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.
My people, remember now what Balak, king of Moab, counseled; and what Balaam, the son of Beor, answered him from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteousness of Jehovah.
With what shall I come before Jehovah, to bow myself before the loftiness of God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with yearling calves?
Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
O man, He has declared to you what is good. And what does Jehovah require of you, but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.
The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city; and one of sound wisdom will see Your name. Hear the staff, and Him who appointed it.
Are there yet in the house of the wicked the treasures of wickedness, and the abominable short ephah?
Shall I declare to be pure the wicked balances, or the bag of deceitful weight stones?
For her rich ones are full of violence, and her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
Therefore I also will make you sick by striking you, making you desolate because of your sins.
You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and your emptiness shall be in your midst; and you will move back, but shall not be safe; and that which you rescue, I will give to the sword.
You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olive, but you shall not anoint yourselves with oil; and new wine, but shall not drink wine.
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab. And you walk in their counsels, so that I may make you a desolation, and your inhabitants a hissing. And you shall bear the reproach of My people.
Woe is me! For I am like the gatherings of summer fruit, like the gleanings of the vintage. There is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fruit.
The good man has perished from the earth, and there is no one upright among mankind. All of them lie in wait for blood; each one hunts his brother with a net.
Both hands are on evil, to do it well. Both the ruler and the judge ask for a bribe. And the great one speaks the lust of his soul; and they weave it together.
The best of them is like a thorn; the upright more than a hedge of thorns. The day of your watchman and your punishment comes; now shall be their perplexity.
Put no faith in a companion; put no trust in a friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom;
for the son dishonors the father; the daughter rises up against her mother; the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
But I will look to Jehovah; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.
Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy; for if I fall, I shall arise. For if I sit in darkness, Jehovah is a light to me.
I will bear the indignation of Jehovah because I have sinned against Him, until He pleads my case and executes justice for me. He will bring me forth to the light; I shall see His righteousness.
And my enemy shall see; and shame shall cover her who said to me, Where is Jehovah your God? My eyes shall see her. Now she shall be trampled down as the mud of the streets.
In the day your walls are to be built, in that day the decree shall be far removed.
In that day they shall come to you from Assyria and the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.
But the land shall become desolate because of those who dwell in it, from the fruit of their doings.
Shepherd Your people with Your rod, the flock of Your possession, who dwell alone in the woodland, in the midst of Carmel. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
As in the days when you came out from the land of Egypt, I will show them marvelous things.
The nations shall see and be put to shame for all their might. They shall lay their hand over their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
They shall lick the dust like a snake; they shall tremble out from their holes like ones that shrink back into the earth; they shall dread Jehovah our God; they shall fear because of You.
Who is a Mighty God like You, forgiving iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His possession? His anger does not remain strong forever, for He delights in mercy.
He will return and have compassion on us; He will subdue our iniquities. And You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
You will give faithfulness to Jacob, goodness to Abraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.
The burden against Nineveh: The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
The Mighty God is jealous, and Jehovah avenges, Jehovah avenges and is a possessor of wrath. Jehovah takes vengeance against His foes, and He maintains wrath against His enemies.
Jehovah is slow to anger, and great of power, and He does not by any means acquit the guilty. Jehovah has His way in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.
He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, and the flower of Lebanon wilts.
The mountains quake before Him, and the hills melt; and the earth is lifted up before Him, even the world and all who dwell in it.
Who can stand before His indignation? And who can endure His burning anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken down because of Him.
Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him.
But with an overrunning flood He will make a complete end of its place, and darkness shall pursue His enemies.
What are you plotting against Jehovah? He will make a complete end of it; affliction shall not rise up a second time.
For as thorns are woven together, and as their drunkards are drunken, they shall be devoured like fully dried straw.
One who devises evil against Jehovah has come forth from you, one counseling worthlessness.
Thus says Jehovah, Though they are secure and so numerous, yet they will be cut off and pass away. And though I have afflicted you, I will not afflict you any more.
And now I will break off his yoke from you and will tear away your bonds.
And Jehovah has given command concerning you. Not one of your name shall be sown any more; I will cut off the carved image and the molten image out of the house of your gods; I will appoint your grave, for you are of no account.
Behold, on the mountains the feet of Him bearing good tidings, proclaiming, Peace! O Judah, keep your feasts; fulfill your vows; for the wicked will no more pass through you; he is completely cut off.
The one scattering is coming up against your face. Guard the rampart; watch the way; make the loins strong, firm up your power exceedingly.
For Jehovah has restored the excellence of Jacob as the excellence of Israel. For the emptiers have emptied them and have destroyed their vine branches.
The shield of his mighty ones has become red, the mighty men are clothed in scarlet, the chariots will come like iron torches in the day of his preparation, and the cypresses are made to shake terribly.
The chariots run madly in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways. Their appearance is like torches; they run swiftly like lightning.
He shall remember its nobles; they shall stumble in their walking; they shall hurry to its wall, and the defense shall be prepared.
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be melted.
And she who stood firm shall be uncovered and carried away; and her maidservants shall lead on, moaning like the sound of doves, beating on their breasts.
And Nineveh of old is like a pool of water; yet they are fleeing. They cry, Halt! Halt! But no one turns back.
Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! For there is no end to the treasures, and riches from all precious objects.
She is empty, desolate, and waste. And the heart is melted, and the knees knocking; and trembling is in all the loins; and all of their faces are flushed.
Where is the den of the lions and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, the lion’s cub walked, and no one made them afraid?
The lion tore in pieces, enough for his cubs, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, even his lairs with torn prey.
Behold, I am against you, declares Jehovah of Hosts; and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions. And I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall not be heard any more.
Woe to the bloody city! It is all full of lies and robbery; the prey does not depart.
The sound of a whip, and the sound of rattling of wheels, and galloping horses, and of bounding chariots.
The horseman lifts up both the gleaming sword and the glittering spear, and many are slain, and there is a mass of dead bodies, and no end of corpses; they stumble over their dead bodies,
because of the many harlotries of the seductive harlot, the mistress of sorceries who sells nations by her harlotries, and families by her sorceries.
Behold, I am against you, declares Jehovah of Hosts, and I will uncover your skirts over your face, and I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.
And I will cast detestable filth on you and will disgrace you. And I will set you as a spectacle.
And it shall be that all those who look upon you shall flee from you and shall say, Nineveh is laid waste; who shall weep for her? From where shall I seek comforters for you?
Are you better than populous No that dwelt among the rivers, waters surrounding her, whose rampart was the sea, whose wall was the sea?
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and without end; Put and Lubim were your helpers.
Yet she was carried away; she went into captivity. Also her young ones were dashed to pieces at the head of all the streets, and they cast lots for her honored ones, and all her great ones were bound in chains.
You also shall be drunken; you shall be hidden; you also shall seek refuge from the enemy.
All your fortresses are fig trees with the firstfruits; if they are shaken, then they shall fall into the mouth of the eater.
Behold, your people in your midst are women; the gates of your land shall surely be opened to your enemies; the fire shall devour your bars.
Draw your water for the siege. Strengthen your fortifications. Go into the clay and tread in the mortar. Make the mold strong.
Fire will devour you there. The sword shall cut you off. It will eat you up like the caterpillar. Make yourself as many as the caterpillar; multiply yourself like the locusts.
You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the heavens; the caterpillar shall strip off and fly away.
Your princes are like the locusts, and your officials are a swarm of locusts that camp in the hedges in the cold day. When the sun rises and they flee, the place where they are is not known.
Your shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria; your nobles are lying down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and no one gathers them.
There is no healing for your fracture; your wound is severe. All who hear the report of you shall clap their hands over you, for on whom has your wickedness not passed continually?
The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
O Jehovah, how long shall I cry for help, and You will not hear? I cry out to You, Violence! But You do not save.
Why do You show me evil, and You cause me to look upon toil? For destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention rises up.
On account of this the law has become feeble, and justice does not continue to go forth. For the wicked surrounds the righteous, so justice goes forth, perverted.
Look among the nations and see, and be amazed. Be astounded. For a work is working in your days which you will not believe, though it be told to you.
For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, the bitter and hasty nation which is proceeding into the breadth of the land, to possess dwellings that are not their own.
They are terrible and fearful; their judgment and their glory goes forth from themselves.
Their horses also are swifter than leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves. And their horsemen spread themselves; yea, their horsemen come from afar; they fly as the eagle hurrying to eat.
All of them shall come for violence; the eagerness of their faces is like the east wind; and they gather captives like the sand.
And they shall scoff against kings, and officials shall be a scorn to them. They shall scorn every fortress, and they shall heap up dirt and capture it.
Then shall his mind change; and he shall pass over and be guilty, crediting this power of his to his god.
Are You not from ancient times, Jehovah my God, my Holy One? We shall not die, Jehovah, for You have appointed them for judgment. And, my Rock, You have established them for correction.
You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and You are not able to look upon vexation. Why do you look on those who deal deceitfully? Will You be silent when the wicked swallows one more righteous than he?
For You make man like the fish of the sea, like creeping things with no ruler over them.
They take up all of them with the hook; they drag them with the net and gather them with the dragnet. On account of this they rejoice and exult.
Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their dragnet; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plentiful.
Shall they therefore empty their net, and shall they not spare to continually slay nations?
I will stand my watch and set myself on the tower, and watch to see what He will say to me, and what I shall reply when I am corrected.
And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision and make it plain on the tablets, that he who reads it may run.
For the vision is yet for the appointed time; it speaks forth to the end, and it does not lie. Though it delays, wait for it, because it will come and take place; it will not tarry.
Behold, the soul of him who is puffed up is not upright; but the just shall live by his faith.
And also, wine indeed betrays a proud man, and he dwells not at home, who widens his soul like Sheol. And he is like death, and is not satisfied, but gathers all the nations to himself, and collects all the peoples to himself.
Shall not all of these take up a parable against him, and a mocking riddle against him, and say, Woe to him who increases what is not his! How long, then, shall he load himself with many pledges?
Shall not those who bite you rise up suddenly, and those who vex you be aroused, and you become a booty to them?
Because you have plundered many nations, all the rest of the people shall plunder you, because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, and the city, and all those dwelling in it.
Woe to him who robs unjust gain for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evil.
You have advised shame for your house, to cut off many peoples, and have sinned in your soul.
For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam shall answer it from the timbers.
Woe to him who builds a town with blood and establishes a city by iniquity.
Behold, is it not of Jehovah of Hosts that the people labor only to feed the fire, and nations weary themselves only for vanity.
For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.
Woe to him who causes his friend to drink, joining with your bottle, and also making him drunk, so as to look upon his nakedness.
You are filled with shame instead of glory; you drink also, and are counted as uncircumcised. The cup of the right hand of Jehovah shall turn on you, and disgrace shall be your glory.
For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the devastation of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, the city, and all those that dwell in it.
What does an image profit, that its maker should carve it; a molten image, and a teacher of falsehood, that the maker should trust in his work, to make mute idols?
Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake! To a mute stone, Rise up, it shall teach. Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, but there is no breath at all in it.
But Jehovah is in His holy temple; let all the earth be silent before Him.
A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet on Shigionoth:
Jehovah, I have heard the report of You, and am afraid. Jehovah, preserve Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known; in wrath remember compassion.
God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His majesty covers the heavens, and His praise fills the earth.
And His brightness is as the light; He has rays coming from His hand, and a covering of His strength.
A pestilence goes before Him, and lightning goes forth at His feet.
He stood and measured the earth; He looked and shook nations; and the ancient mountains were scattered; the perpetual hills bowed down. His ways are eternal.
I saw the tents of Cushan under wickedness; the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
Was Jehovah furious against the rivers? Or was Your anger against the rivers? Or Your wrath against the sea; that You rode on horses, Your chariots of salvation?
You bare Your bow naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even Your Word. Selah. You have divided the earth with rivers.
The mountains saw You and writhed. The floods of water passed by. The deep uttered its voice and lifted up its hands on high.
The sun and moon stood still in their dwelling. At the light of Your arrows they went, at the shining of Your glittering spear.
You marched through the land in indignation. You threshed the nations in anger.
You went forth for the salvation of Your people, for the salvation of Your anointed. You struck the head from the house of the wicked by laying bare the foundation to the neck. Selah.
You thrust through with his own arrows the head of his villages. They came out in a rage to scatter me; their exultation was to devour the humble in secret.
You trod in the sea with Your horses through the surging of many waters.
When I heard, my body trembled; my lips quivered at the sound. Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled within myself, that I might rest in the day of distress. When he comes up against the peoples, he will attack.
Though the fig tree shall not blossom, and fruit is not on the vines; the work of the olive fails, and the fields yield no food; the flock is cut off from the fold, and no herd is in the stalls,
yet I will exult in Jehovah; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
Jehovah God is my strength, and He makes my feet like does’ feet, and He will make me to walk on my high places. To the chief singer, on Neginoth.
The Word of Jehovah which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
I will gather up and make an end of all things from off the face of the land, declares Jehovah.
I will gather away man and beast: I will gather away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling-blocks, even the wicked. And I will cut off man from the face of the land, declares Jehovah.
I will also stretch out My hand on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, the names of the idolatrous priests, with the priests;
and those who bow down to the host of the heavens on the housetops; and those who bow, swearing to Jehovah, but also swearing by Melech,
and those drawing back from following Jehovah, and who have not sought Jehovah, nor inquired of Him.
Be silent in the presence of the Lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is near. For Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated the ones He called.
And it shall come to pass in the day of the sacrifice of Jehovah, that I will punish the rulers and the king’s sons, and all those clothed in foreign apparel.
And I will punish all those who leap on the threshold in that day, who fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.
And it shall be in that day, declares Jehovah, the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate, and a howling from the Second, and a loud crashing from the hills.
Howl, you inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people have perished; all those who carry silver are cut off.
And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and punish the men who are curdled in their dregs; who say in their heart, Jehovah will not do good, nor will He do evil.
Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation. They shall also build houses, but not live in them. And they shall plant vineyards, but not drink their wine.
The great day of Jehovah is near; it is near and hastens greatly, the sound of the day of Jehovah. The mighty man shall cry out bitterly there.
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of desolation and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
a day of the shofar and alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high towers.
And I will bring distress upon men, and they shall walk like the blind, because they have sinned against Jehovah. And their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh like dung.
Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah. But all the earth shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy. For He shall make a complete and speedy end of all those who live in the land.
Gather yourselves, yes gather together, O nation not desired;
before the decree is brought forth, the day shall pass like the chaff, yet not before the hot anger of Jehovah comes upon you, yet not before the day of the anger of Jehovah comes upon you.
Seek Jehovah, all the meek of the earth who have done His justice; seek righteousness; seek meekness. It may be that you shall be hidden in the day of the anger of Jehovah.
For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation. They shall drive Ashdod out at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, the nation of the Cherethites! The Word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; I will destroy you so that there shall not be an inhabitant.
And the seacoast shall be meadows, cottages for shepherds, and folds for the flocks.
And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed on them. In the houses of Ashkelon, they shall lie down in the evening, for Jehovah their God shall visit them and return their captives.
I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, with which they have reproached My people and have magnified themselves against their border.
Therefore, as I live, declares Jehovah of Hosts, the God of Israel, surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a desolation forever. The rest of My people shall plunder them, and the remnant of the nation shall possess them.
They shall have this for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of Hosts.
Jehovah will be terrifying to them, for He will make lean all the gods of the earth. Each man from his place and all the islands of the nations will bow to Him.
You also, O Ethiopians, shall be slain by My sword.
And He will stretch out His hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, dry like the wilderness.
And flocks shall lie down in her midst; all the beasts of the nations; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the capitals of its pillars. Their voice shall sing at the windows; desolation shall be at the threshold; for He will lay bare the cedar work.
This is the joyous city, that dwelt confidently, who said in her heart, I am, and there is no other. How she has become a desolation, a place for animals to lie down. Everyone who passes near her shall hiss; he shall shake his hand.
Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
She did not give heed to the voice; she did not receive correction; she did not trust in Jehovah; she did not draw near to her God.
Her rulers within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves, that do not leave the bones till the morning.
Her prophets are wanton, treacherous people; her priests have profaned the sanctuary; they have done violence to the Law.
The righteous Jehovah is in her midst; He will do no wrong. Every morning He gives His justice to the light; He does not fail, but the unjust knows no shame.
I have cut off nations; their towers are desolate. I made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are laid waste, without a man, with no inhabitant.
I said, Surely you will fear Me; you will receive instruction; so that her dwelling should not be cut off, all that I appointed for her. But they rose up early; they corrupted all their doings.
Therefore, wait for Me, declares Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey. For My judgment is to gather the nations, for Me to gather the kingdoms, to pour My fury out on them, all My burning anger. For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy.
For then I will transform to the peoples a pure language, to call on the name of Jehovah, to serve Him with one purpose.
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, My suppliants, the daughter of My scattered ones, shall bring My offering.
In that day you shall not be ashamed for all your doings which you have transgressed against Me. For then I will take away out of your midst those who rejoice in your pride, and you shall not again be haughty any more in My holy mountain.
I will also leave a poor and weak people in your midst, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.
The remnant of Israel shall not do injustice, nor speak lies. And a deceitful tongue shall not be found in their mouth. For they shall feed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.
Cry aloud for joy, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem!
Jehovah has taken away your judgments; He has turned away your enemy. Jehovah, the King of Israel, is in your midst; you shall not see evil any more.
In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not, Zion. Do not let your hands be weak.
Jehovah your God is mighty in your midst; He will save. He will rejoice over you with joy; He will quiet you in His love. He rejoices over you with joyful praise.
I will gather the afflicted ones from the appointed place; they were among you, an utterance of reproach.
Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you. And I will save her who is lame, and gather her who was banished. And I will appoint them for praise and for renown in all the lands where they have been put to shame.
At that time I will bring you back, even at the time that I gather you. For I will give you for renown and for praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I return your captives before your eyes, says Jehovah.
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah; and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, This people says, The time has not come, the time for the house of Jehovah to be built.
Then the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Is it time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, and this house to lie waste?
And now, thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart on your ways.
You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but do not have enough; you drink, but are not filled with drink; you put on clothes, but no one is warm. And, one hiring himself out earns wages for a bag of holes.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Set your heart on your ways.
Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build this house. And I will be pleased with it, and I will be glorified, says Jehovah.
You looked for much, and, lo, it came to little. And when you brought it home, then I blew on it. Why? says Jehovah of Hosts. Because of My house that is in ruins, and you, each man, runs to his own house.
On account of this, the heavens above you hold back the dew, and the earth holds back her fruit.
And I called for a drought in the land, and on the mountains, and on the grain, and on the new wine, and on the oil, and on that which the ground brings forth, and on man, and on livestock, and on all the labor of your hands.
Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of Jehovah their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him. And the people feared before Jehovah.
And Haggai, the messenger of Jehovah, spoke the message of Jehovah to the people, saying, I am with you, says Jehovah.
And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of Jehovah of Hosts, their God,
in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
In the seventh month, on the twenty-first of the month, the Word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
Who is left among you who saw this house in her former glory? And how do you see it now? When compared to it, is it not as nothing in your eyes?
Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Jehovah. And be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And be strong, all you people of the land, and work, says Jehovah. For I am with you, says Jehovah of Hosts.
According to the Word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, so My Spirit stands among you; do not fear.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Yet once more (it is a little while), and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.
And I will shake all the nations; and the desire of all nations shall come. And I will fill this house with glory, says Jehovah of Hosts.
The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says Jehovah of Hosts.
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, says Jehovah of Hosts. And in this place I will give peace, says Jehovah of Hosts.
In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai the prophet, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Now ask the priests the Law, saying,
If one carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches his skirt to the bread, or boiled food, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
And Haggai said, If an unclean body touches these, is it unclean? And the priests answered and said, It is unclean.
And Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before Me, declares Jehovah. And so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.
And now set your heart on it, from this day and onward: before the placing of a stone on a stone in the temple of Jehovah;
since those days, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty from the wine trough, there were but twenty.
I struck you with blight, and with mildew, and with hail, in all the labors of your hands; yet you did not turn to Me, says Jehovah.
Now set your heart from this day and forward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day that the foundation of Jehovah’s temple was laid. Consider in your heart.
Is the seed still in the barn? As yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless them.
And again the Word of Jehovah came to Haggai, in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,
Speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.
And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders, and the horses and their riders will come down, each one by the sword of his brother.
In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, says Jehovah, and will make you like a signet; for I have chosen you, declares Jehovah of Hosts.
In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
Jehovah has been wrathfully angry with your fathers.
Therefore say to them, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Turn back to Me, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I will turn back to you, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Do not be as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have proclaimed, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Turn back now from your evil ways and your evil doings. But they did not hear nor heed Me, says Jehovah.
Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?
But My Words and My statutes which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they turned back and said, As Jehovah of Hosts purposes to do to us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so He has dealt with us.
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,
I saw by night; and behold, a man riding on a red horse; and he stood among the myrtle trees in the ravine; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
Then I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are.
And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
And they answered the Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still and is at rest.
Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of Hosts, how long will You not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Judah, against which You have had indignation these seventy years?
And Jehovah answered the angel who talked with me with good words, words of comfort.
So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion, with a great jealousy.
And I am exceedingly angry at the nations at ease; for I was but a little angry, and they helped further the evil.
Therefore Jehovah says this: I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; My house shall be built in it, says Jehovah of Hosts, and a line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
Cry out again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four horns.
And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
And Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.
And I said, What are these coming to do? And He spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head. But these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.
I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
And I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.
And, behold, the angel who talked with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him,
and said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will be inhabited like unwalled villages, for the multitude of men and livestock in her midst.
For I will be to her a wall of fire all around, and I will be the glory in her midst, declares Jehovah.
Ho! Ho! Flee from the land of the north, says Jehovah; for I have scattered you as the four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.
O Zion! Escape, you who live with the daughter of Babylon.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts: He has sent Me after glory to the nations who plundered you; for he who touches you touches the pupil of His eye.
For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be spoils for their servants. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent Me.
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion. For, lo, I come; and I will dwell in your midst, says Jehovah.
And many nations shall be joined to Jehovah in that day, and they shall be My people. And I will dwell in your midst; and you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent Me to you.
And Jehovah shall take possession of Judah, His portion in the holy land, and shall again choose Jerusalem.
All flesh, be silent before Jehovah. For He is raised up out of His holy habitation.
And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to oppose him.
And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah rebuke you, Satan! Even Jehovah who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked out of the fire?
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel.
And He answered and spoke to those who stood before Him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And He said to him, Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with robes of state.
And I said, Let them set a clean turban on his head. And they set a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the Angel of Jehovah stood by.
And the Angel of Jehovah admonished Joshua, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: If you will walk in My ways, and if you will keep My charge, then you shall also judge My house, and shall also keep My courts, and I will give you places to walk among these who stand by.
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your companions who are sitting before you; for they are men of significance. For, behold, I will bring forth My Servant, the BRANCH.
For behold, the stone which I have laid before Joshua, on the one stone are seven eyes. I will engrave its engraving, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.
In that day, says Jehovah of Hosts, you shall invite each man his neighbor to sit under the vine and under the fig tree.
And the angel who spoke with me returned and awakened me, as a man is awakened out of his sleep.
And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand, all of gold, with a bowl on top of it, and its seven lamps on it, and seven pipes each to the seven lamps on top;
and two olive trees are beside it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.
So I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?
And the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the Word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forth the capstone with shouts: Grace! Grace to it!
Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah which run to and fro through all the earth.
Then I answered and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand, and on its left?
And I answered again and said to him, What are the two olive branches beside the two golden pipes, emptying the golden oil out of themselves?
And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
And he said, These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
And I again lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, a flying scroll.
And he said to me, What do you see? And I answered, I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.
And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For from now on everyone who steals shall be purged out according to it; and everyone who swears from now on shall be purged out according to it.
And I will bring it forth, says Jehovah of Hosts. And it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of the one who swears falsely by My name. And it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall make an end to it, and its timber, and its stones.
Then the angel who talked with me went out, and said to me, Now lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that goes forth. And he said, This is their appearance throughout the earth.
And, behold, a lead disk was lifted up, and a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah.
And he said, This is wickedness. And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah; and he threw the lead stone over its opening.
Then I lifted up my eyes and looked. And, behold, two women came out. And the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of the stork. And they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
And I said to the angel who talked with me, Where are they going with the ephah?
And he said to me, To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and it shall be prepared and set there on its own base.
And again I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, four chariots were coming from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.
With the first chariot were red horses, and with the second chariot black horses,
and with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth dappled and strong horses.
And I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord?
And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of Heaven who go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
The black horses in it go into the land of the north, and the white go after them; and the dappled ones go toward the land of the south.
And the strong ones went forth and sought to go, to walk to and fro through the earth. And He said, Go. Walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
And He cried out to me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these who go toward the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north.
And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,
Take from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, the exiles who have come from Babylon; and in the same day go and enter into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah.
And take silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
And speak to him, saying, Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, Behold, the Man whose name is THE BRANCH. And He shall spring up out of His place, and He shall build the temple of Jehovah.
Even He shall build the temple of Jehovah; and He shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on His throne. And He shall be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between the two of them.
And the crown shall be for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah, to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah.
And those from afar shall come and build in the temple of Jehovah. And you shall know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass if you will give heed and obey the voice of Jehovah your God.
And in the fourth year of King Darius, the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, in the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev.
And Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men, were sent to Bethel to make supplication before Jehovah,
and to speak to the priests who were in the house of Jehovah of Hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, consecrating myself as I have done these many years?
Then the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came unto me, saying,
Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, even those seventy years, did you truly fast to Me, even to Me?
And when you ate, and when you drank, did you not eat and drink for yourselves?
Are not these the Words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem with her cities all around her were inhabited and prosperous, and the south and the lowlands were inhabited?
And the Word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts, saying, Judge true justice, and show goodness and compassion, everyone to his brother.
And do not oppress the widow, or the fatherless, the alien, or the poor. And do not devise evil in your heart, a man against his brother.
But they refused to heed, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and they made their ears heavy that they might not hear.
And they made their heart adamant so as not to hear the Law and the Words which Jehovah of Hosts has sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. And great wrath came from Jehovah of Hosts.
Therefore it has come to pass that, just as He called, and they would not hear; so they called, and I did not hear, says Jehovah of Hosts.
But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, with no one passing through and returning; for they made the pleasant land a waste.
Again the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.
Thus says Jehovah: I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem shall be called a City of Truth, and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy Mountain.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet be old men and old women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem; and each man with his staff in his hand because of great age.
And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, will it also be marvelous in My eyes? says Jehovah of Hosts.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Behold, I will save My people from the land of the rising sun and from the land of the sunset.
And I will bring them, and they shall live in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands become strong, you who hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, that in the day the foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts is laid, the temple is to be built.
For before these days there were no wages for man, nor any payment for animal; and there was no peace for those who went out or came in because of the enemy. For I sent every man, a man against his neighbor.
But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in former days, says Jehovah of Hosts.
For there shall be peace for the seed: the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these.
And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands become strong.
For thus says Jehovah of Hosts, As I purposed to punish you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath, says Jehovah of Hosts, and I did not show compassion,
so again I have purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem, and the house of Judah. Do not fear.
These are the things that you shall do. Every man speak the truth with his neighbor. Judge truth, justice and peace in your gates,
and let none of you devise evil in your heart against his neighbor, and do not love a false oath. For all these things I hate, says Jehovah.
And the Word of Jehovah of Hosts came unto me, saying,
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be for joy and gladness and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: There shall yet come people, and the inhabitants of many cities.
And those living in one city shall go to another, saying, Let us proceed and go make supplication before Jehovah, and seek Jehovah of Hosts; I will go also.
And many people and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, and to make supplication before Jehovah.
Thus says Jehovah of Hosts: In those days ten men out of all languages of the nations shall take hold and grasp the sleeve of a man who is a Jew, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.
The burden of the Word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach, and its resting place, Damascus, (when the eyes of man, and all the tribes of Israel are toward Jehovah),
and Hamath also borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
And Tyre shall build a fortress for herself, and shall pile up silver like the dust, and gold like the mud of the streets.
Behold, the Lord will dispossess her, and He will strike her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire.
Ashkelon shall see and fear; Gaza also shall writhe in great pain; and Ekron, her expectation shall be dried up. And the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth. But the remnant, even he, shall be for our God. And he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
And I will camp around My house because of the army, because of him who passes by and because of him who returns. And an oppressor shall not pass through them any more. For now I have seen with My eyes.
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you! He is righteous and having salvation, lowly, and riding on an ass, even on a colt, the foal of an ass.
And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow shall be cut off, and He shall speak peace to the nations. And His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
As for you, by the blood of your covenant I have set free your prisoners from the pit, where there is no water.
Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope. Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.
For I have bent Judah for Me as a bow, filled it with Ephraim, and stirred up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and made you as the sword of a mighty man.
Then Jehovah will be seen over them, and His arrow shall go out as lightning; and the Lord Jehovah shall blow the shofar and shall go forth with the tempests of the south.
Jehovah of Hosts shall defend them. And they shall devour and subdue with slingstones. And they shall drink and roar, as with wine. And they shall be full like a bowl, like the corners of the altar.
And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they are as stones of a crown, lifted up as a sign over His land.
For how great is its goodness, and how great its beauty. Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.
Ask rain from Jehovah in the time of the latter rain. Jehovah shall make lightnings. And He gives them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.
For the family idols speak iniquity, and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain. Therefore they wandered like sheep. They were troubled because there was no shepherd.
My anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the rams. For Jehovah of Hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, and made them as His majestic horse in battle.
From Him came the cornerstone, from Him the nail, from Him the battle bow, and from Him every ruler together.
And they shall be like mighty ones who trample the mud of the streets in the battle. And they shall fight because Jehovah is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. And I will return to save them, for I have mercy on them. And they shall be as though I had not cast them off, for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
And Ephraim shall be like a mighty one, and their heart shall be glad as by wine. And their sons shall see and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in Jehovah.
I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them. And they shall multiply as they once multiplied.
And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember Me in far countries, and they shall live with their sons and return.
And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria. And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, until no more room shall be found for them.
And He shall pass through the sea with distress and strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the river shall dry up. And the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall be removed.
And I will strengthen them in Jehovah, and they shall walk up and down in His name, says Jehovah.
Open your doors, O Lebanon, so that the fire may devour your cedars.
Howl, fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the majestic are destroyed. Howl, O oaks of Bashan, for the inaccessible forest has come down.
A voice of the wailing of the shepherds; for their splendor is destroyed. A voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is destroyed.
For thus says Jehovah my God, Feed the flock for slaughter,
whose possessors kill them and are not held guilty. And those who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich. And their shepherds do not pity them.
For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah. But, lo, I will deliver every man found, each one into his neighbor’s hand, and into his king’s hand. And they shall strike the land, and I will not deliver them out of their hand.
And I fed the flock of slaughter, the truly poor of the flock. And I took two staffs for Myself: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bonds. And I fed the flock.
I also cut off three shepherds in one month. And My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred Me.
Then I said, I will not feed you; that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off. And let the ones remaining, each woman, eat the flesh of her neighbor.
And I took My staff, Beauty, and chopped it in two, that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
And it was broken in that day, and so the poor of the flock who were watching Me knew that it was the Word of Jehovah.
And I said to them, If it is good in your eyes, give Me My wages; and if not, refrain. And they weighed out My wages, thirty pieces of silver.
And Jehovah said to Me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price at which I was valued by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of Jehovah.
Then I chopped in two My second staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
And Jehovah said to Me, Take to yourself yet the vessels of a foolish shepherd.
For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land; he shall not visit those who are cut off, nor will he seek the young, nor heal that which is broken, nor will he nourish that which still stands. But he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear off their hooves.
Woe to the worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword shall be against his arm and against his right eye. His arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be totally darkened.
The burden of the Word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens, and lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him.
Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling to all the peoples all around, and it shall also be against Judah in the siege against Jerusalem.
And in that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall be slashed; cut to pieces. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.
In that day I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness, says Jehovah. And I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the people with blindness.
And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in Jehovah of Hosts, their God.
In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire among cut grain. And they shall devour all the peoples all around, on the right hand and on the left. And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, in Jerusalem.
Jehovah also shall save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be magnified above Judah.
In that day Jehovah shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And he who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the Angel of Jehovah before them.
And it shall be in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and supplication. And they shall look on Me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they shall be bitter over Him, like the bitterness over the firstborn.
In that day the mourning in Jerusalem shall be great, like the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.
And the land shall mourn, each family alone: the family of the house of David alone, and their wives alone; the family of the house of Nathan alone, and their wives alone;
the family of the house of Levi alone, and their wives alone; the family of Shimei alone, and their wives alone;
all the families who remain, each family alone, and their wives alone.
In that day a fountain shall be opened to the house of David and to those living in Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.
And it shall be in that day, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no longer be remembered, says Jehovah of Hosts. And I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
And it shall be that when any shall continue to prophesy, then his father and his mother who begot him shall say to him, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of Jehovah. And his father and his mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.
And it shall be in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed, each one of his vision when he prophesies, and they shall not wear a hairy garment to deceive.
But he shall say, I am not a prophet; I am a man who tills the ground, for a man taught me to engage in business from my youth.
And one shall say to Him, What are these wounds between Your hands? Then He shall answer, Those with which I was beaten in the house of those who love Me.
Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man who is My Associate, says Jehovah of Hosts. Strike the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn My hand on the little ones.
And it shall come to pass in all the land, says Jehovah, that two parts in it shall be cut off and perish, but the third shall be left in it.
And I will bring the third part through the fire, and I will refine them as silver is refined. And I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name, and I will answer them. I will say, It is My people, and they shall say, Jehovah is my God.
Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, and your spoils shall be divided in your midst.
For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem. And the city shall be captured, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished. And half the city shall go into captivity and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
And Jehovah shall go forth and fight against those nations, like the day He fought in the day of battle.
And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall split in two, from the east even to the west, a very great valley. And half of the mountain shall move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
And you shall flee to the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, and all the saints with You.
And it will come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light; the great lights will shrink.
And it will be one day which shall be known to Jehovah; not day and not night, but it will happen, that there will be light at evening time.
And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.
And Jehovah shall be King over all the earth. In that day there shall be one Jehovah, and His name one.
All the land shall be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. And it shall rise and dwell in its place, from Benjamin’s Gate to the place of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananeel to the king’s winepresses.
And they shall live in it. And there shall never again be utter destruction, but Jerusalem shall dwell safely.
And this shall be the plague with which Jehovah will strike all the people who have fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall rot away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot away in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot away in their mouths.
And it shall happen in that day, that a great confusion from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall each one lay hold of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.
And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of the surrounding nations shall be gathered together; gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.
And so shall be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and all the beasts which shall be in those camps, like this plague.
And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left from all the nations which came up against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, and keep the Feast of Booths.
And it shall be, that whoever will not go up from the families of the earth to Jerusalem to bow down before the King, Jehovah of Hosts, even upon them there shall be no rain.
And if the family of Egypt does not go up, nor come in, then they shall have no rain; the same plague with which Jehovah shall strike the nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.
This shall be Egypt’s punishment, and the punishment of all nations who do not come up to keep the Feast of Booths.
In that day there shall be on the bells of the horses, HOLY TO JEHOVAH. And the pots in the house of Jehovah shall be like the bowls before the altar.
And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy to Jehovah of Hosts. And all those who sacrifice shall come and take of them, and boil in them. And in that day there shall not ever again be a merchant in the house of Jehovah of Hosts.
The burden of the Word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of Malachi.
I have loved you, says Jehovah. Yet you say, In what way have You loved us? Was not Esau the brother to Jacob? says Jehovah; yet I loved Jacob,
and I have hated Esau and have made his mountains and his inheritance a desolation for the jackals of the wilderness.
Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus says Jehovah of Hosts: They shall build, but I will tear down. And they shall call them the region of wickedness, and the people with whom Jehovah has indignation forever.
And your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Jehovah will be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My fear? says Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you say, In what way have we despised Your name?
You offer defiled food on My altar, and say, In what way have we defiled You? By saying, The table of Jehovah is to be held in contempt.
And if you offer the blind in sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? Bring it now to your governor. Will he be pleased with you or receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.
And now entreat the face of the Mighty God, that He may be gracious to us. This has been by your hands; will He receive you favorably? says Jehovah of Hosts.
Who is there even among you that will shut the doors, so that you not kindle fire on My altar in vain? I have no pleasure in you, says Jehovah of Hosts, nor will I accept a food offering from your hand.
For from the east to the west, My name shall be great among the nations, and everywhere incense shall be offered to My name; and a pure food offering; for My name shall be great among the nations, says Jehovah of Hosts.
But you profane it when you say, The table of the Lord is defiled; and its fruit, His food is to be held in contempt.
And you have said, Behold, what weariness. And you have sniffed at it, says Jehovah of Hosts. And you bring what was stolen, and the lame, and the sick; and you bring the grain offering. Should I accept it from your hand? says Jehovah.
But cursed be a deceiver when there is a male in his flock, he vows it, but sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says Jehovah of Hosts, and My name is feared among the nations.
And now, O priests, this command is to you.
If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to My name, says Jehovah of Hosts, then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. And indeed, I have cursed it, because you are not laying it to heart.
Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your solemn feasts; and one will take you away with it.
And you shall know that I have sent this command to you, to be My covenant with Levi, says Jehovah of Hosts.
My covenant with him was life and peace, and I gave them to him for fear; and he feared Me, and he was in awe before My name.
The Law of Truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness he walked with Me, and he turned many away from iniquity.
For the lips of the priest should keep knowledge, and they should seek the Law from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of Hosts.
But you have turned aside out of the way; you have caused many to stumble at the Law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says Jehovah of Hosts.
So I have also made you despised and low before all the people, just as you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in the Law.
Is there not one father to us all? Has not one Mighty God created us? Why do we act deceitfully each man with his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
Judah has dealt treacherously, and has done an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man who does this, waking and answering, or offering a grain offering to Jehovah of Hosts.
And this is a second thing you do: covering the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping and crying out; so that He does not regard the grain offering, nor receive it with delight from your hand.
Yet you say, For what reason? Because Jehovah has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously; and she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
And has He not made them one? Yet the remnant of the Spirit is in him. And why one? He was seeking a seed of God. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth.
For Jehovah the God of Israel, says that He hates divorce, and to cover violence with one’s garment, says Jehovah of Hosts. Therefore take heed to your spirit and do not deal treacherously.
You have wearied Jehovah with your words. Yet you say, In what way have we wearied Him? When you say, Every evildoer is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and He delights in them; or, Where is the God of justice?
Behold, I send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant, in whom you delight. Behold, He comes, says Jehovah of Hosts.
But who can endure the day of His coming? And who will stand when He appears? For He is like a refiner’s fire and like fuller’s soap.
And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold and like silver, that they may draw near to Jehovah with an offering in righteousness.
Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.
And I will come near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those swearing to a lie; and against those who defraud the hired laborer of his pay, and turn away the widow, and the fatherless, and the alien; and who do not fear Me, says Jehovah of Hosts.
For I, Jehovah, change not. Therefore you sons of Jacob are not destroyed.
From the days of your fathers, you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of Hosts. But you say, In what way shall we return?
Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me. But you say, How have we robbed You? In the tithe and the offering.
You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed Me, even this whole nation.
Bring all the tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now with this, says Jehovah of Hosts, whether I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour out a blessing until there is not enough room to store it.
And I will rebuke the devourer for you, and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground; nor shall your vine fail to bear fruit in the field, says Jehovah of Hosts.
And all nations shall call you blessed, for you shall be a delightful land, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Your words have been strong against Me, says Jehovah. Yet you say, What have we spoken against you?
You have said, It is vain to serve God. And, What profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked as mourners before Jehovah of Hosts?
And now we are calling the arrogant blessed. Those that work wickedness are built up; they even test God, and escape.
Then those who feared Jehovah spoke together, each man to his neighbor. And Jehovah gave attention and heard. And a Book of Remembrance was written before Him for those who feared Jehovah, and for those who thought on His name.
And they shall be Mine, says Jehovah of Hosts, for the day that I will make up My treasure. And I will pity them as a man has compassion on his son who serves him.
Then you shall again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who does not serve Him.
For, behold, the day is coming, burning like a fire pot; and all the proud and everyone that does wickedness shall be chaff. And the coming day will set them ablaze, says Jehovah of Hosts, which will not leave to them root or branch.
But to you who fear My name, the Sun of Righteousness shall rise up, with healing on His wings. And you shall go out and frisk like calves of the stall.
And you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do this, says Jehovah of Hosts.
Remember the Law of My servant Moses which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and judgments.
Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of Jehovah.
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to their fathers, that I not come and strike the earth with utter destruction.
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:
Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begot Pharez and Zarah by Tamar, Pharez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Aram.
And Aram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.
And Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,
and Jesse begot David the king. David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.
And Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
And Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.
And Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
And Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.
And Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
And Azor begot Sadok, Sadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.
And Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.
And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the deportation into Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation into Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this way: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child from the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph her husband, being just, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.
So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is translated, God with us.
Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.
Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
saying, Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to do homage to Him.
When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
So they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the leaders of Judah; for out of you shall come One leading Who will shepherd My people Israel.
Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, asked of them exactly what time the star appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you find Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and do homage to Him also.
When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and did homage to Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And being warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.
And when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, take the Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod is about to seek the young Child in order to destroy Him.
When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,
and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt I called My Son.
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired from the wise men.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
saying, Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child’s life are dead.
And he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.
In those days John the Immerser came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near!
For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.
And John himself was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather waistband around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him
and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Therefore bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,
and do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
And now already the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore any tree which does not bear good fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire.
I indeed immerse you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire;
whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the granary; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.
Then Jesus comes from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be immersed by him.
But John tried to prevent Him, saying, I need to be immersed by You, and do You come to me?
But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he allowed Him.
And when He had been immersed, Jesus went up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.
And behold a voice out of heaven, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.
And when the tempter came to Him, he said, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become bread.
But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that comes forth from the mouth of God.
Then the devil takes Him up into the holy city, and sets Him on the wing of the temple,
and says to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, and, in their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.
Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
Again, the devil takes Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he says to Him, All these things I will give to You if You will fall down and do homage to me.
Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it has been written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.
Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.
Now when Jesus heard that John was delivered up to prison, He withdrew into Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great Light, and upon those sitting in the region and shadow of death, Light has sprung up.
From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has drawn near.
And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And He says to them, Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.
And they immediately left their nets and followed Him.
And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them,
and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.
And Jesus went around all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.
And His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all the sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.
And great multitudes followed Him; from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
And seeing the multitudes, He went up into a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
And He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are they who have been persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.
Blessed are you when they shall revile and persecute you, and shall say every evil word against you falsely because of Me.
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for in this manner they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a grain measure, but on a lampstand, and it shines for all who are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.
Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.
For truly I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the Law till all is fulfilled.
Whoever therefore relaxes one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of Heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of Heaven.
For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.
You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.
But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Empty head! shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of Gehenna.
Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.
Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Truly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.
You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not commit adultery.
But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
And if your right eye snares you into sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.
And if your right hand snares you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, and not your whole body be cast into Gehenna.
Furthermore it has been said, Whoever puts away his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.
But I say to you that whoever puts away his wife for any reason except sexual perversion causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.
Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.
But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by Heaven, for it is God’s throne;
nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.
But let your word be Yes, yes; No, no. For whatever is more than these is from evil.
You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you, Do not resist evil. But whoever hits you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also.
And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
Give to him who asks of you, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.
You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who abuse you and persecute you,
that you may become sons of your Father in Heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors the same?
And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not also the tax collectors so?
Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect.
Take heed that you do not do your deeds of mercy before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in Heaven.
Therefore, when you do a deed of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have praise from men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.
But when you do a deed of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does,
that your deed of mercy may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.
But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, do not babble vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.
Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
In this manner, therefore, pray: Our Father in Heaven, Holy is Your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our bread sufficient for this day.
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward.
But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves dig through and steal;
but lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not dig through and steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.
Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?
Observe the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Which of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?
So why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin;
and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?
For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
Judge not, that you be not judged.
For with whatever judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with whatever gauge you measure, it will be measured back to you.
And why do you look at the twig in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the beam in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the twig from your eye; and behold, a beam is in your own eye?
Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the twig from your brother’s eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many entering in through it.
Because narrow is the gate and distressing is the way which leads unto life, and there are few who find it.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
You will know them from their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
Even so, every good tree produces excellent fruit, but a corrupt tree produces evil fruit.
A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, nor is a corrupt tree able to produce excellent fruit.
Every tree that does not produce excellent fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore from their fruits you will know them.
Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in Heaven.
Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many works of power in Your name?
And then I will declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, you who work out lawlessness!
Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock;
and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.
And everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man who built his house on the sand;
and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.
And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the multitudes were astonished at His doctrine,
for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him.
And behold, a leper came and did homage to Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You have the power to make me clean.
Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus said to him, See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
And when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, begging Him,
saying, Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, being terribly tormented.
And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!
And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven.
But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you. And his servant was healed that same hour.
And when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, He saw his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever.
And He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.
When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed everyone who was sick,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.
And when Jesus saw great multitudes around Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side.
And a certain scribe came and said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.
And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
And another of His disciples said to Him, Lord, let me first go away and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.
And when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.
And, behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.
And His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us! We are perishing!
And He said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
So the men marveled, saying, Of what sort is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?
And when He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?
And a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.
So the demons begged Him, saying, If You cast us out, allow us to go away into the herd of swine.
And He said to them, Go. So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.
Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart out of their borders.
So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city.
And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Son, be of good courage; your sins are forgiven you.
And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, This Man blasphemes!
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts?
For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Arise and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; then He said to the paralytic, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
And he arose and departed to his house.
And when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. So he arose and followed Him.
And it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples.
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?
But when Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
But go and learn what this means: I desire mercy and not sacrifice. For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?
And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.
Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and did homage to Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.
So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.
And behold, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment.
For she said within herself, If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.
But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, Be of good courage, daughter; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour.
And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the crowd wailing loudly,
He said to them, Make room, for the girl has not died, but is sleeping. And they ridiculed Him.
But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
And the report of this went out into all that land.
And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, Son of David, have mercy on us!
And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? And they said to Him, Yes, Lord.
Then He touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be to you.
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly ordered them, saying, See that no one knows it.
But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.
And as they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed.
And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, It was never seen like this in Israel!
But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.
And He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,
nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.
And into whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out.
And when you go into a house, greet it.
If the house is truly worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!
Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues.
And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;
for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.
And you will be hated by everyone on account of My name. But he who endures to the end will be kept safe.
But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For truly I say to you, you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.
It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household!
Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be uncovered, and hidden that will not be known.
Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
And do not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. But rather fear Him who has power to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father.
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Therefore whoever shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in Heaven.
But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in Heaven.
Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
and a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.
He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.
And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life on account of Me will find it.
He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus finished commanding His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples
and said to Him, Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?
Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you hear and see:
The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
And blessed is he who does not stumble because of Me.
And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.
Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Immerser; but he who is least in the kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.
And from the days of John the Immerser until now the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,
and saying: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not lament.
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.
The Son of Man comes eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a glutton and a wino, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her children.
Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent:
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, It will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.
At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes.
Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest unto your souls.
For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!
But He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him:
how he entered the house of God and ate the Bread of Presentation which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?
Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple.
But if you had known what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
And when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue.
And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath? that they might accuse Him.
And He said to them, What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?
How much more, then, does a man excel a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole, as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.
But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed everyone of them.
And He warned them not to make Him known,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will declare judgment to the Gentiles.
He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench, till He sends forth judgment to victory;
and in His name the Gentiles will hope.
Then one was brought to Him who was demon-possessed, blind and mute; and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.
And all the multitudes were amazed and said, Is this not the Son of David?
But when the Pharisees heard it they said, This one does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.
But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.
He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.
Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.
Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for a tree is known by its fruit.
Offspring of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.
But He answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold one greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold one greater than Solomon is here.
When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came out. And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be unto this wicked generation.
While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
Then one said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.
But He answered and said to the one who told Him, Who is My mother and who are My brothers?
And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, Here are My mother and My brothers.
For whoever does the will of My Father in Heaven, that one is My brother and sister and mother.
On the same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
And great multitudes were gathered together to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: Behold, a sower went out to sow.
And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them.
Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth.
And when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away.
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them.
But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: this indeed a hundredfold, that sixty, that thirty.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak to them in parables?
He answered and said to them, Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but to them it has not been given.
For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: Hearing you will hear and shall not at all understand, and seeing you will see and by no means perceive;
for the heart of this people has grown dull, their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, that they should not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their heart and convert, and I should heal them.
But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear;
for truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
Therefore hear the parable of the sower:
When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is that which was sown by the wayside.
That which was sown on stony places, this is he who hears the Word and immediately receives it with joy;
yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when affliction or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately he stumbles.
And that which was sown among the thorns is he who hears the Word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word, and he becomes unfruitful.
But that which was sown on the good ground is he who hears the Word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: this a hundredfold, that sixty, that thirty.
Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;
but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way.
But when the grain had sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.
So the servants of the owner came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?
He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Do you want us then to go and gather them up?
But he said, No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.
Another parable He put forth to them, saying: The kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,
which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.
Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened.
All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.
Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.
He answered and said to them: He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one.
The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.
The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all the stumbling blocks, and those who practice lawlessness,
and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells everything he has and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,
who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold everything he had and bought it.
Again, the kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind,
which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the rotten away.
So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go forth, separate the wicked from among the righteous,
and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them, Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes, Lord.
Then He said to them, Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of Heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old things.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.
And when He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers Jacob, Joses, Simon, and Judas?
And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man get all these things?
So they were offended in Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.
And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
and said to his servants, This is John the Immerser; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these works of power are at work in him.
For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
Because John had said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.
And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.
So she, having been instructed by her mother, said, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Immerser.
And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded it to be given to her.
So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
And his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.
When Jesus heard it, He withdrew from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. And when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot out of the cities.
And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick.
And when it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.
But Jesus said to them, They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.
And they said to Him, We have here only five loaves and two fish.
He said, Bring them here to Me.
And He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes.
So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.
Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
And immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away.
And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the mountain by Himself to pray. And when evening came, He was there alone.
But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost! And they cried out for fear.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.
And Peter answered Him and said, Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.
So He said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus.
But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me!
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.
Then those who were in the boat came and did homage to Him, saying, Truly You are the Son of God.
And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick,
and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched it were made completely well.
Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,
Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by reason of your tradition?
For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.
But you say, Whoever says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God;
and he does not honor his father or mother. Thus you have voided the commandment of God by your tradition.
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:
These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
And in vain they revere Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
And when He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, Hear and understand:
Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.
Then His disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?
But He answered and said, Every plant which My Heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into the ditch.
Then Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.
So Jesus said, Are you also still without understanding?
Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated into the sewer?
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual perversions, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.
These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.
Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a woman of Canaan came from those borders and cried out to Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is grievously demon-possessed.
But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us.
But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
Then she came and did homage to Him, saying, Lord, help me!
But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
But she said, Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table.
Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
And Jesus departed from there, came beside the Sea of Galilee, and went up into the mountain and sat down there.
And great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they cast them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.
So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, that they not faint on the way.
And His disciples said to Him, Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great multitude?
Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few little fish.
So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude.
So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left.
And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the borders of Magdala.
Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and tempting Him, asked that He would show them a sign out of Heaven.
He answered and said to them, When it is evening you say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red;
and in the morning, It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. And He left them and departed.
And when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread?
Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?
Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up?
How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?
Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?
So they said, Some say John the Immerser, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
He said to them, But who do you say that I am?
Simon Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in Heaven.
And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this Rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against It.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be, having been bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be, having been loosed in Heaven.
Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.
From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.
Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, Far be it from You, Lord; this shall never be to You!
But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a snare to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his practice.
Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
And after six days Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John his brother, and led them up into a high mountain by themselves;
and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.
Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him.
And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and were greatly terrified.
And Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be terrified.
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.
Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.
And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
And Jesus answered and said to them, Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.
But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise the Son of Man is also about to suffer under them.
Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Immerser.
And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying,
Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and suffers miserably; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
And I brought him to Your disciples, but they were not able to cure him.
Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.
And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why could we not cast it out?
And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief; for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible unto you.
However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,
and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorrowful.
And when they had come to Capernaum, those who received the tribute came to Peter and said, Does your Teacher not pay the tribute?
He said, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?
Peter said to Him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free.
Nevertheless, that we not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greater in the kingdom of Heaven?
And Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them,
and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of Heaven.
Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is greater in the kingdom of Heaven.
Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks, for stumbling blocks must come; but woe to that man by whom the stumbling block comes!
If your hand or foot entices you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire.
And if your eye entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into the fire of Gehenna.
Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in Heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in Heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying?
And if he should find it, truly I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in Heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses to hear the church, let him be to you like a foreigner and a tax collector.
Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be, having been bound in Heaven; and whatever you loose on earth will be, having been loosed in Heaven.
Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will come to pass for them from My Father in Heaven.
For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.
Then Peter came to Him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?
Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Until seven times, but until seventy times seven.
Therefore the kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, also his wife and children and everything he had, and that payment be made.
The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.
Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.
But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe!
So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.
And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.
So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.
Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?
And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay every bit that was due to him.
Thus My Heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, that He departed from Galilee and came to the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.
The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for just any reason?
And He answered and said to them, Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female,
and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?
So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let not man separate.
They said to Him, Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?
He said to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
And I say to you, whoever puts away his wife, except for sexual perversion, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.
His disciples said to Him, If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is not good to marry.
But He said to them, Not all have room to receive this saying, but only those to whom it has been given:
For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to receive it, let him receive it.
Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.
And He laid His hands on them and departed from there.
And behold, one came and said to Him, Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
So He said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
He said to Him, Which? Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,
Honor your father and your mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?
Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, Truly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven.
And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?
But Jesus looked at them and said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?
And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
For the kingdom of Heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
And when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
and said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. So they went.
Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, Why do you stand here idle all day?
They said to him, Because no one hired us. He said to them, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.
So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.
And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.
But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.
And when they had received it, they murmured against the landowner,
saying, These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.
But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.
Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?
So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.
And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them,
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,
and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.
Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Him with her sons, bowing and asking something from Him.
And He said to her, What do you wish? She said to Him, Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.
But Jesus answered and said, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with? They said to Him, We are able.
And He said to them, You will indeed drink My cup, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.
And when the ten heard it, they were indignant about the two brothers.
But Jesus called them to Himself and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave;
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.
And as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
And the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
And Jesus stood still and called them, and said, What do you want Me to do for you?
They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.
And when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me.
And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them, and immediately he will send them.
All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.
So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they led the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them.
And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.
And the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
And the multitudes said, This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.
And Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
And He said to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were indignant
and said to Him, Do You hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise?
And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He hungered.
And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, Let fruit no longer grow on you forever. And immediately the fig tree dried up.
And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How quickly the fig tree has dried up.
So Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, it will happen.
And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached Him as He was teaching, and said, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority?
And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:
The immersion of John; where was it from? From Heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?
But if we say, From men, we fear the multitude, for everyone holds John as a prophet.
So they answered Jesus and said, We do not know. And He said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go, work today in my vineyard.
He answered and said, I will not, but afterward he regretted it and went.
And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, but he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you.
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.
Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.
Now when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.
And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.
Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.
Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, They will respect my son.
But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.
So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?
They said to Him, He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will deliver to him the fruits in their seasons.
Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it.
And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him to pieces.
Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking of them.
But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitudes, because they held Him as a prophet.
And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said:
The kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king who made a wedding feast for his son,
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast; and they were not willing to come.
Again, he sent out other servants, saying, Tell those being invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.
But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.
And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.
But when the king heard about it, he was angry. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
Then he said to his servants, The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding feast.
So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.
So he said to him, Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
And the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
For many are called, but few are chosen.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His words.
And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.
Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why do you test Me, hypocrites?
Show Me the tribute money. So they brought Him a denarius.
And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this?
They said to Him, Caesar’s. And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way.
The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him,
saying: Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed for his brother.
Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no seed, left his wife to his brother.
Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh.
Last of all the woman died also.
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.
Jesus answered and said to them, You are in error, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in Heaven.
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.
But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they were gathered together.
Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,
Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?
Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
saying, What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He? They said to Him, The Son of David.
He said to them, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying:
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool?
If David then calls Him Lord, how is He his son?
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore.
Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples,
saying: The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.
Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.
For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.
They love the chief places at feasts, the chief seats in the synagogues,
greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
But you, do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in Heaven.
Nor be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.
But he who is greater among you shall be your servant.
And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of Heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive more abundant condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice more a son of Gehenna than yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is a debtor.
Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And, Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it is a debtor.
Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it.
He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And he who swears by Heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin, and have disregarded the weightier matters of the law: judgment and mercy and faith. It is necessary to do these, and not to leave the others undone.
Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.
Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
and say, If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.
Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers.
Serpents! Offspring of vipers! How will you escape the condemnation of Gehenna?
Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city,
in order that on you may come all the righteous blood poured out upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Truly, I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I say to you: You shall see Me no more till you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Truly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?
And Jesus answered and said to them: Take heed that no one leads you astray.
For many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and will lead many astray.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of travail.
Then they will deliver you up to affliction and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.
And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another.
And many false prophets will rise up and lead many astray.
And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end shall be kept safe.
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (whoever reads, let him understand),
then let those who are in Judea flee into the mountains.
Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.
And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
For then there will be great affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be.
And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be kept safe alive; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ; or, There; do not believe it.
For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
Behold, I have told you beforehand.
Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the desert, do not go out; or, Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes out of the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
And immediately after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the heavens, and then all the tribes of the earth will wail, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things are fulfilled.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My Words will by no means pass away.
But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of Heaven, but My Father only.
But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
and did not realize until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Then two will be in the field: one is taken and the other is left.
Two will be grinding at the mill: one is taken and the other is left.
Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord comes.
But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief comes, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be dug through.
Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man comes at an hour you do not expect.
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made administrator over his household, to give them food in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.
Truly, I say to you that he will appoint him as administrator over all his possessions.
But if that wicked servant says in his heart, My master delays his coming,
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,
the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him and in an hour he does not know,
and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the kingdom of Heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five foolish.
Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them,
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all nodded and fell asleep.
And at midnight there was a cry: Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!
Then all those virgins arose and prepared their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
But the wise answered, saying, No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us!
But he answered and said, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.
Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man comes.
For the kingdom of Heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.
And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on the journey.
Then he who had received the five talents went and did business with them, and made another five talents.
And likewise he who had received two, also gained two more.
But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord’s money.
After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.
So he who had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents; behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.
His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will appoint you administrator over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
He also who had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents; behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.
His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will appoint you administrator over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Behold, there you have what is yours.
But his lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.
So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.
Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.
And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.
And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.
Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
for I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;
I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?
When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?
Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?
And the King will answer and say to them, Truly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.
Then He will also say to those on the left hand, Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels:
for I was hungry and you did not give Me a thing to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a thing to drink;
I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.
Then they also will answer Him, saying, Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?
Then He will answer them, saying, Truly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.
And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, that He said to His disciples,
You know that after two days is the Passover, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
and plotted to take Jesus by trickery and kill Him.
But they said, Not during the Feast, that there not be an uproar among the people.
And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,
a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly ointment, and she poured it on His head as He sat at the table.
But when His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste?
For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.
But when Jesus was aware of it, He said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work toward Me.
For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have Me.
For in pouring this ointment on My body, she did it for My burial.
Truly, I say to you, Wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial of her.
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
and said, What will you give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
So from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.
Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?
And He said, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and prepared the Passover.
When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve.
And as they were eating, He said, Truly, I say to you, One of you will betray Me.
And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, Lord, it is not I is it?
He answered and said, He who dips his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me.
The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he was never born.
Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, Rabbi, it is not I is it? He said to him, You have said it.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink all of it.
For this is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.
But I say to you, I will not at all drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Then Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.
But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter answered and said to Him, Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.
Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.
Peter said to Him, Even if I have to die with You, I will not at all deny You! And so said all the disciples.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit here while I go and pray over there.
And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and in extreme anguish.
And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Stay here and watch with Me.
And He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.
And He came to the disciples and found them asleep, and said to Peter, What? Were you not able to watch with Me one hour?
Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.
And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then He came to His disciples and said to them, Sleep on and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.
Arise, let us be going. Behold, My betrayer is at hand.
And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.
Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.
And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, Greetings, Rabbi; and kissed Him.
But Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you here? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him.
And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
But Jesus said to him, Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Or do you think that I am not able now to pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels?
How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?
In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you come out, as against a robber, to take Me with swords and clubs? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.
But all this is happening that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.
And those who had laid hold of Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
But Peter followed Him at a distance to the high priest’s courtyard. And he went in and sat with the servants to see the end.
Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the council sought false testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,
but found none. Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at last two false witnesses came forward
and said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.
And the high priest arose and said to Him, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men bear witness against You?
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!
Jesus said to him, You said it. Nevertheless, I say to you, Hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard His blasphemy!
What is your opinion? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
Then they spat in His face and beat Him with the fist; and others slapped Him,
saying, Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck You?
Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are saying.
And when he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!
And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them, for your speech betrays you.
Then he began to curse and swear, saying, I do not know the Man! And immediately a rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus who had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.
When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He was condemned, repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying, I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? You see to it.
And he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.
And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.
And they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued,
and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.
And Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, It is as you say.
And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.
Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they witness against You?
But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.
Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished.
And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
For he knew that they had delivered Him over because of envy.
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? They said, Barabbas!
Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say to him, Let Him be crucified!
And the governor said, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out all the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!
When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather that a tumult was rising, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see to it.
And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us and on our children.
Then he released Barabbas to them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison against Him.
And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.
And when they had woven a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!
And they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head.
And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.
Now as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they compelled to bear His cross.
And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,
they gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink. But when He had tasted it, He would not drink.
And they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.
And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.
And they put up over His head the accusation written against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And two robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and another on the left.
And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads
and saying, You who destroys the temple and builds it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.
Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said,
He saved others; He has no power to save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.
He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him; for He said, I am the Son of God.
Even the robbers who were crucified with Him reviled Him with the same thing.
Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
Some of those who stood there, when they heard that, said, This Man calls for Elijah.
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.
The rest said, Let be; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.
And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.
Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split,
and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;
and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and were manifest to many.
Now when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God!
And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him, were there looking on from afar,
among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
And when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded the body to be given.
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.
And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
And on the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate,
saying, Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, After three days I will rise.
Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, that His disciples not come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, He has risen from the dead. So the last deception will be worse than the first.
Pilate said to them, You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from Heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.
His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow.
And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.
And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.
And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and behold He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.
And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to report this to His disciples.
And as they went to bring word to His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Greetings! And they came and held Him by the feet and did homage to Him.
And Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.
Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
saying, Say, His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.
And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free from anxiety.
So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews to this day.
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
And when they saw Him, they did homage to Him; but some doubted.
And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority is given to Me in Heaven and on earth.
Go therefore and instruct all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Prophets: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.
The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.
John came immersing in the wilderness and preaching an immersion of repentance for the remission of sins.
And all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him and were all immersed by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a leather waistband around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he preached, saying, There comes One after me who is mightier than I, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
I indeed immerse you in water, but He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.
And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was immersed by John in the Jordan.
And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending upon Him like a dove.
And a voice came from Heaven, You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.
And He was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to Him.
Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.
And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
And they immediately left their nets and followed Him.
And when He had gone a little farther from there, He saw Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.
And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him.
And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught.
And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,
saying, Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are; the Holy One of God!
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!
And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him.
And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.
And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.
And as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with Jacob and John.
But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and at once they told Him about her.
So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.
And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
And He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
And in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there prayed.
And Simon and those who were with Him followed after Him.
And when they found Him, they said to Him, Everyone is looking for You.
But He said to them, Let us go into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I have come forth.
And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.
Now a leper came to Him, begging Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can make me clean.
And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, I am willing; be made clean.
And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once,
and said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
However, he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to Him from every direction.
And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house.
And immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the Word to them.
And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men.
And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had dug through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you.
But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins except for One, God?
And immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
Which is easier: To say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; He said to the paralytic,
I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this!
Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.
And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. So he arose and followed Him.
And it happened, as He was dining in Levi’s house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?
When Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?
And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.
Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain.
And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?
But He said to them, Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:
how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the Bread of Presentation, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those who were with him?
And He said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
And He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Stand up in the middle.
And He said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they kept silent.
And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.
And the Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.
But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea
and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him.
And He said to His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, that they might not press upon Him.
For He healed many, such that, as many as had plagues lunged upon Him in order to touch Him.
And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God!
But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.
And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.
And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them forth to preach,
and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:
Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;
Jacob the son of Zebedee and John the brother of Jacob, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder;
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite;
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.
And the multitude came together again, so that they were not even able to eat bread.
But when His next of kin heard about this, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, He is beside Himself.
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, by the ruler of the demons He casts out demons.
So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand.
And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.
No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.
Truly, I say to you, All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may blaspheme;
but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has remission, but is subject to eternal damnation;
because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.
And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are seeking You outside.
But He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?
And He looked around in a circle at those who sat around Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers.
For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.
And again He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea.
And He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in His teaching:
Listen. Behold, a sower went out to sow.
And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it.
Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.
But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.
And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
But other seed fell on good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up, increased and produced: one thirtyfold, one sixty, and one a hundred.
And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
And when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.
And He said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things are in parables,
so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; lest they should convert, and their sins be forgiven them.
And He said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all parables?
The sower sows the Word.
And these are the ones by the wayside where the Word is sown: When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.
These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with joy;
and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when affliction or persecution arises on account of the Word, immediately they stumble.
And these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the Word,
and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things entering in choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.
But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the Word, receive it, and bear fruit: one thirtyfold, one sixty, and one a hundred.
And He said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?
For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but what it will come to light.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.
For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
And He said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,
and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.
For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.
But when the fruit yields, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.
And He said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?
It is like a grain of mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;
but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the air are able to nest under its shade.
And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them as they were able to hear it.
But He did not speak to them without a parable. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples.
And the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side.
And when they had sent away the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him.
And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already full.
But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?
And He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent! Be muzzled! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.
And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?
And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?
And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.
And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains,
because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him.
And continually, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.
And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and did homage to Him.
And he cried out with a loud voice and said, What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God that You do not torment me.
For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit.
And He asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion; for we are many.
He also begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.
Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.
So all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
And Jesus immediately gave them permission. And the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.
And those who fed the swine fled, and they told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.
And they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.
And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the swine.
And they began to beg Him to depart from their borders.
And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him.
However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.
And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone marveled.
And when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea.
And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet
and begged Him earnestly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.
So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.
And a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse.
When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment.
For she said, If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.
And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was healed of the plague.
And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My clothes?
But His disciples said to Him, You see the multitude thronging You, and do You say, Who touched Me?
And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.
And the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened in her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.
And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your plague.
While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house who said, Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid; only believe.
And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, Jacob, and John the brother of Jacob.
And He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly.
And when He came in, He said to them, Why do you make this commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is sleeping.
And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying.
And He took the child by the hand, and said to her, Talitha, koumi, which is translated, Little girl, I say to you, Arise.
And immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were beside themselves with great amazement.
And He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given to her to eat.
And He went out from there and came to His own country, and His disciples followed Him.
And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing Him were astonished, saying, Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such works of power are performed by His hands?
Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of Jacob, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.
But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own kindred, and in his own house.
And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.
And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.
And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits,
and commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in their money belts;
but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.
And He said to them, In whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place.
And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
So they went out and preached that people should repent.
And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.
Now King Herod heard of Him, for His name had become well known. And he said, John the Immerser has been raised from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.
Others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.
But when Herod heard, he said, This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead.
For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her.
For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.
Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but was not able;
for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.
Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday made a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.
And when Herodias’ daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.
He also swore to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.
So she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Immerser.
And immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, I want you to give me on a platter at once the head of John the Immerser.
And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to slight her.
And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison,
brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
And He said to them, Come apart by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have opportunity to eat.
So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.
But the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him.
And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.
And when the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.
Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.
But He answered and said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?
But He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they found out they said, Five, and two fish.
Then He commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.
So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties.
And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among them all.
So everyone ate and was filled.
And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.
And those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.
And immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away.
And when He had sent them away, He departed into the mountain to pray.
And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.
And He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by.
And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out;
for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, Be of good courage. It is I; do not be afraid.
And He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled.
For they did not understand about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.
And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and drew to shore.
And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,
ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was.
And wherever He entered into villages, cities, or in the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.
Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.
And when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.
For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands with the fist, holding the tradition of the elders.
And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold, like the dipping of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches.
So the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?
He answered and said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me.
And in vain they revere Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men; the dipping of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do.
And He said to them, Full well you set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.
For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.
But you say, If a man says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift),
then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,
making the Word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.
And when He had called all the multitude to Himself, He said to them, Hear Me, everyone, and understand:
There is nothing that enters a man from outside which is able to defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
And when He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.
So He said to them, Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,
because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and goes out as waste? Thus He was purifying all foods.
And He said, What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.
For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual perversions, murders,
thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.
All these evil things come from within and defile a man.
From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered a house and wanted no one to know it, but He could not be hidden.
For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet.
The woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.
And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.
Then He said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.
And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.
And again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the middle of the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.
And they brought to Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Him to put His hand on him.
And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue.
Then, looking up to Heaven, He sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke correctly.
And He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it.
And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.
In those days, the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and said to them,
I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat.
And if I send them away hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.
And His disciples answered Him, How can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?
He asked them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven.
So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
And they also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, He said to set them also before them.
So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven baskets of leftover fragments.
And those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away,
and immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.
And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from Heaven, testing Him.
But He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, As if a sign will be given to this generation!
And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side.
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat.
And He charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
But Jesus, knowing, said to them, Why do you reason because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?
Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.
Also, when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.
So He said to them, How is it you do not understand?
Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him.
So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.
And he looked up and said, I see men like trees, walking.
Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly.
Then He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell anyone in the town.
And Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?
So they answered, John the Immerser; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.
He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.
And He charged them that they should tell no one about Him.
And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days to rise again.
And He spoke this word openly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.
And when He had called the people to Himself, with His disciples also, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?
Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.
And He said to them, Truly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God coming with power.
Now after six days Jesus took Peter, Jacob, and John, and led them up into a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them.
And His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no fuller on earth is able to whiten them.
And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah;
because he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.
And a cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.
And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.
Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man should rise from the dead.
So they kept this word to themselves, questioning what rising from the dead might be.
And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
And He answered and said to them, Truly, Elijah comes first and restores all things. And how it is written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt.
But I say to you that Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.
And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them.
And immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to Him, greeted Him.
And He questioned the scribes, What are you disputing with them?
And one of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit.
And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams, gnashes his teeth, and withers away. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they were not able.
He answered him and said, O unbelieving generation. How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.
And they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming.
So He asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood.
And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.
Jesus said to him, If you are able to believe, all things are possible to him who believes.
And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe! Help my unbelief!
When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Deaf and mute spirit, I command you, Come out of him and enter him no more.
And the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as if dead, so that many said, He has died.
But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, Why could we not cast it out?
And He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.
And they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know it.
For He taught His disciples and said to them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise the third day.
But they did not understand this word, and were afraid to ask Him.
And He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, What was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?
But they kept silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves as to who was greater.
And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.
And He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them,
Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.
And John answered Him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.
But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for no one who does a work of power in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me.
For he who is not against us is on our behalf.
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, Truly, I say to you, He will by no means lose his reward.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck, and he be thrown into the sea.
If your hand makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having two hands, to go to Gehenna, into the fire that shall never be quenched;
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame, rather than having two feet, to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that shall never be quenched;
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
And if your eye makes you stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into the fire of Gehenna;
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.
Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
Then He arose from there and came into the borders of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And multitudes came together to Him again, and as He was accustomed, He taught them again.
And the Pharisees came and asked Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? testing Him.
And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?
They said, Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.
And Jesus answered and said to them, Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.
But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.
For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife,
and the two shall become one flesh; so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Therefore what God has yoked together, let not man separate.
In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter.
So He said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery against her.
And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another, she commits adultery.
And they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But when Jesus saw it, He was indignant and said to them, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.
Truly, I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.
And He took them up in His arms, put His hands on them, and blessed them.
And as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
So Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God.
You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.
And he answered and said to Him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.
Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.
But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God.
And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, Who then is able to be saved?
But Jesus looked at them and said, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.
Then Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left everything and followed You.
So Jesus answered and said, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, on account of Me and the gospel,
who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time; houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed. And as they followed they were afraid. Then He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that were about to happen to Him:
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles;
and they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.
Then Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.
And He said to them, What do you want Me to do for you?
They said to Him, Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.
But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?
They said to Him, We are able. So Jesus said to them, You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the immersion I am immersed with you will be immersed;
but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.
And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant with Jacob and John.
But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, You know that those who seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
But it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.
And whoever of you desires to become first shall be slave of all.
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.
And they came to Jericho. And as He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the road begging.
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
And many warned him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. Then they called the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage. Arise, He is calling you.
And throwing aside his garment, he arose and came to Jesus.
And Jesus answered and said to him, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, My Master, that I may see again.
And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you well. And immediately he saw again and followed Jesus on the road.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples;
and said to them, Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you have entered it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has sat. Loose it and bring it.
And if anyone says to you, Why do you do this? say, The Lord has need of it, and immediately he will send it here.
So they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it.
But some of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, loosing the colt?
And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go.
And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it.
And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
And those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the Highest!
And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.
And the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry.
And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.
And answering Jesus said to it, Let no one eat fruit from you ever again. And His disciples heard it.
So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
And He would not allow anyone to carry any vessel through the temple.
And He taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.
And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the crowd was astonished at His doctrine.
And when evening had come, He went out of the city.
Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
And Peter, remembering, said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered away.
And Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God.
For truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will be done, it will be to him, whatever he says.
Therefore I say to you, Everything whatever you ask when you pray, believe that you receive, and it will be to you.
And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive, that your Father in Heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.
But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses.
And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.
And they said to Him, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?
And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one question, and answer Me; and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
The immersion of John; was it from Heaven or from men? Answer Me.
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?
But if we say, From men; they feared the people, for all counted John to have truly been a prophet.
So they answered and said to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus answered and said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
And He began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.
And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers.
And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty.
And again he sent to them another servant, and at him they threw stones, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.
And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some.
Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, They will reverence my son.
But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.
So they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.
Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others.
Have you not even read this Scripture: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;
this came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
And they sought to lay hold on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away.
And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in His words.
And when they had come, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
Shall we give, or shall we not give? But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it.
So they brought it. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? They said to Him, Caesar’s.
And Jesus answered and said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marveled at Him.
Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying:
Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.
Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no seed.
And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.
So the seven had her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.
Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.
Jesus answered and said to them, Are you not therefore in error, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in Heaven.
But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him at the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly in error.
And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, Which is the first commandment of all?
Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment.
And the second, like it, is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
So the scribe said to Him, Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other besides Him.
And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one dared question Him.
Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?
For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.
Therefore David himself calls Him Lord; how is He then his son? And the large crowd heard Him gladly.
And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces,
the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,
who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive surpassing condemnation.
And Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people threw money into the treasury. And many who were rich threw in much.
Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans.
So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, Truly, I say to you that this poor widow has thrown in more than all those who have thrown into the treasury;
for they all threw in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty threw in all that she had, her whole livelihood.
And as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, Teacher, see what manner of stones and what buildings!
And Jesus answered and said to him, Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew questioned Him privately,
Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?
And Jesus, answering them, began to say: Take heed that no one leads you astray.
For many will come in My name, saying, I AM, and will lead many astray.
But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled; for it is necessary for such things to come about, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of travail.
But take heed to yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.
And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
But when they lead you away and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will speak. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak that; for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.
And you will be hated by everyone on account of My name. But he who endures to the end shall be kept safe.
So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.
And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!
And pray that your flight may not be in winter.
For in those days there will be affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be.
And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be kept safe alive; but because of the elect, whom He chose, He has shortened the days.
Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ; or, Look, He is there; do not believe it.
For false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders to cause, if possible, even the elect to go astray.
But take heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.
But in those days, after that affliction, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
the stars of heaven will be falling, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
And they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven.
Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near; at the doors.
Truly, I say to you, This generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.
But of that day and hour no one knows, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, except the Father.
Take heed, watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is.
It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.
Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming; in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning;
that, coming suddenly, he not find you sleeping.
And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.
After two days it was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by deceit and put Him to death.
But they said, Not during the Feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.
And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly ointment of spikenard. And she broke the flask and poured it on His head.
But there were some who were indignant within themselves, and said, Why was this ointment wasted?
For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
But Jesus said, Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work toward Me.
For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good; but you do not always have Me.
She has done what she was in a position to do. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.
Truly, I say to you, Wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.
Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to deliver Him to them.
And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.
Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?
And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.
And wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?
And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared; make ready for us there.
So His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as He had said to them; and they prepared the Passover.
And in the evening He came with the twelve.
Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said, Truly, I say to you, one of you who eats with Me will betray Me.
And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Surely not me? And another said, Surely not me?
And He answered and said to them, It is one of the twelve, who dips with Me in the dish.
The Son of Man truly goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
And He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
And He said to them, This is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many.
Truly, I say to you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
And Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.
But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter said to Him, Even if all are made to stumble, yet not I.
And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.
But he spoke more vehemently, If I need to die with You, I will not deny You! And they all said likewise.
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.
And He took Peter, Jacob, and John with Him, and He began to be in dread and deeply distressed.
And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.
And He went a little farther, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.
And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.
And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not strong enough to watch one hour?
Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.
And when He returned, He found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.
And He came the third time and said to them, Sleep on now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.
Rise up, let us be going. Behold, the one betraying Me is at hand.
And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
And His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I kiss, it is He; seize Him and lead Him away safely.
And as soon as He had come, immediately he went up to Him and said to Him, Rabbi, Rabbi! and kissed Him.
And they laid their hands on Him and took Him.
And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me?
I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.
And they all forsook Him and fled.
And a certain young man followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him,
and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.
And Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.
And the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none.
For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies were not the same.
And some rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,
We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
And neither in this was their testimony the same.
And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men witness against You?
But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him, saying to Him, Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
Jesus said, I AM. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of Heaven.
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What further need do we have of witnesses?
You have heard the blasphemy! What does it appear to you? And they all condemned Him to be worthy of death.
And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with the fist, and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the officers struck Him with slaps.
Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.
But he denied it, saying, I neither know nor understand what you are saying. And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed.
And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, This is one of them.
And he denied it again. And a little later those who stood by said to Peter again, Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees.
Then he began to curse and swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak!
And a second time the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And when he thought on it, he wept.
And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.
And Pilate asked Him, Are You the King of the Jews? He answered and said to him, It is as you say.
And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing.
Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do You answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against You!
But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.
Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they asked.
And there was one named Barabbas, who was in bonds with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the insurrection.
And the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them.
But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up because of envy.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
So Pilate answered and said to them again, What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?
And they cried out again, Crucify Him!
Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out all the more, Crucify Him!
So Pilate, intending to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified.
And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison.
And they clothed Him with purple; and they wove a crown of thorns, put it on Him,
and began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!
And they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bending the knee, they bowed to Him.
And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.
And they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross.
And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.
And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.
And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take.
And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.
And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And they also crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, And He was numbered with the transgressors.
And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,
save Yourself, and come down from the cross!
Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, He saved others, but He is not able to save Himself.
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.
And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is translated, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
And some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, Behold, He is calling for Elijah.
And someone ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down.
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
And when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, Truly this Man was the Son of God!
There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob the Less and of Joses, and Salome,
who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.
Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming, boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
And Pilate marveled that He had already died; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for awhile.
And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
And he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.
Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him.
And very early in the morning, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb at sunrise.
And they said among themselves, Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?
But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away; for it was very large.
And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side; and they were afraid.
But he said to them, Do not be afraid. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.
But go, tell His disciples, and Peter, that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.
So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were astonished. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Now when He arose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.
She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.
And when they heard that He lives and was seen by her, they did not believe.
After that, He appeared in another form to two of them as they walked and went into the country.
And they went and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.
Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had been raised.
And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
He who believes and is immersed will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.
And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;
they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.
So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.
And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the Word through the signs following. Amen.
Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those things which have been fulfilled among us,
just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word, delivered them to us,
it seemed good to me also, having closely followed all things from the very first, to write it to you in orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,
that you may know the certainty of the words which you were told.
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.
So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,
according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.
And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.
And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
And Zacharias said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.
And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad tidings.
But behold, you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their season.
And the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he lingered so long in the temple.
But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.
And so it was, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he departed to his own house.
Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,
Thus the Lord has done with me, in the days when He looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.
Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary.
And having come in, the angel said to her, Hail, favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!
But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and contemplated what kind of greeting this might be.
And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor from God.
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS.
He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David.
And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.
Then Mary said to the angel, How can this be, since I do not know a man?
And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.
Now behold, Elizabeth your kinswoman has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren.
For not one declaration of God will be impossible.
Then Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.
And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,
and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
And she spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
And why is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
Blessed is she who believes, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.
And Mary said: My soul magnifies the Lord,
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.
For He regards the lowly state of His handmaid; for behold, henceforth all generations will count me blessed.
For He who is mighty does great things to me, and holy is His name.
And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.
He performs mightily with His arm; He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
He puts down the mighty from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.
He fills the hungry with good things, and the rich He sends away empty.
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,
as He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever.
And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.
Now Elizabeth’s time was fulfilled for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son.
And her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.
So it was, on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they were calling him by the name of his father, Zacharias.
And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
But they said to her, There is no one among your kindred who is called by this name.
So they made signs to his father; what he would have him called.
And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. So they all marveled.
And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.
And fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
And all those who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What kind of child will this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:
Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,
and raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,
as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began,
Deliverance from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,
to perform mercy with our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,
the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:
To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,
in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,
to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,
through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;
to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his proclamation to Israel.
And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.
This census first took place while Cyrenius was governing Syria.
So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.
Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,
to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.
So it was, that while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to give birth.
And she gave birth to her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.
And the angel said to them, Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.
For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
And this is the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men!
And so it came about, when the angels had departed from them into Heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us go at once to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.
And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.
Now when they had seen, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.
And all those who heard it marveled at the things which were told them by the shepherds.
But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.
And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called JESUS, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.
And when the days of her purification according to the Law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),
and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the Law,
he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:
Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word;
for my eyes have seen Your Salvation
which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
a Light to bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the Glory of Your people Israel.
And Joseph and His mother marveled at the things which were spoken concerning Him.
And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against
(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
And there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;
and she was a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.
And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Him to all those in Jerusalem who looked for redemption.
So when they had performed all things according to the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.
And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.
Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.
And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.
And when they had finished the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it;
but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.
So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.
And so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.
And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.
And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, Son, why have You done this to us? Behold, Your father and I have sought You, greatly distressed.
And He said to them, Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I need to be in the things of My Father?
But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them; but His mother kept all these words in her heart.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
while Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the Word of God came upon John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching an immersion of repentance for the remission of sins,
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.
Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill made low; the crooked places shall be made straight and the rough ways level;
and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be immersed by him, Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So the multitudes asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
He answered and said to them, He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.
Then tax collectors also came to be immersed, and said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?
And he said to them, Collect no more than what is appointed for you.
Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, And what shall we do? So he said to them, Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.
Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether or not he was the Christ,
John answered, saying to them all, I indeed immerse you in water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loosen. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit and fire.
His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.
And with many other exhortations he preached to the people.
But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,
also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison.
Now when all the people were immersed, it came to pass that Jesus also was immersed; and while He prayed, the Heaven was opened.
And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from Heaven which said, You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.
And Jesus Himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Janna, the son of Joseph,
the son of Mattathiah, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
the son of Maath, the son of Mattathiah, the son of Semei, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,
the son of Joannas, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,
the son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,
the son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattathah, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,
the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
being tried for forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry.
And the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.
But Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word of God.
Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
And the devil said to Him, All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.
Therefore, if You will do homage before me, all will be Yours.
And Jesus answered and said to him, Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, You shall do homage to the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.
Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the wing of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here.
For it is written: He shall give His angels charge concerning you, to guard you,
and, In their hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash your foot against a stone.
And Jesus answered and said to him, It has been said, You shall not test the Lord your God.
And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.
And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.
So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:
The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free with deliverance those who are oppressed;
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
And He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him.
And He began to say to them, Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
And all bore witness to Him, and marveled at the gracious words going forth out of His mouth. And they said, Is this not Joseph’s son?
And He said to them, You will surely say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal yourself. Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your country.
And He said, Truly, I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
But I tell you truly, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;
but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a widow woman.
And many lepers were in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with rage,
and rose up and thrust Him out of the city; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.
But passing through the midst of them, He went His way.
And He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority.
And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,
saying, Leave us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are; the Holy One of God!
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown him into their midst, it came out of him and did not hurt him.
And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What a word this is. For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
And He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was sick with a high fever, and they entreated Him concerning her.
So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.
When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.
And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, You are the Christ, the Son of God! And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.
And when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowd sought Him and came to Him, and tried to keep Him from leaving them;
but He said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent.
And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.
And it came to pass that, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the Word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,
and saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets.
And He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.
But Simon answered and said to Him, Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.
And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking.
So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.
And when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!
For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;
and so also were Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not fear. From now on you will be catching men.
So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.
And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus, fell on his face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You are able to cleanse me.
Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. Immediately the leprosy left him.
And He charged him to tell no one, But go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
However, the report went around concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.
And He withdrew Himself into the wilderness and prayed.
And it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
And behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him.
And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with his bed through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.
And seeing their faith, He said to him, Man, your sins are forgiven you.
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone?
But knowing their thoughts, answering, Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?
Which is easier; to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; He said to the man who was paralyzed, I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
And amazement seized them all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen incredible things today!
And after these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me.
So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.
Then Levi made Him a great feast in his own house. And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.
And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against His disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?
And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.
Then they said to Him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?
And He said to them, Can you make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.
And He spoke a parable to them: No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.
But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for he says, The old is better.
Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that He went through the grainfields. And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate them, rubbing them in their hands.
And some of the Pharisees said to them, Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?
But Jesus answering them said, Have you never read this, what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him;
how he went into the house of God, took and ate the Bread of Presentation, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?
And He said to them, The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
And it also happened on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and taught. And a man was there whose right hand was withered.
So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.
But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Arise and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.
Then Jesus said to them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy?
And when He had looked around at them all, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.
But they were filled with madness, and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
Now it came to pass in those days that He went out into the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
And when it was day, He called His disciples; and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles:
Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; Jacob and John; Philip and Bartholomew;
Matthew and Thomas; Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;
Judas of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.
And He came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed from their diseases,
as well as those who were tormented by unclean spirits. And they were healed.
And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed everyone.
And He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man.
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy. For behold, your reward is great in Heaven, for in the same way their fathers did to the prophets.
But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.
Woe to you who are full, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers did the same things to the false prophets.
But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
bless those who curse you, and pray for those who treat you abusively.
To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either.
Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your goods do not ask for them back.
And as you would have men do to you, you also do likewise to them.
For if you love those who love you, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners do the same.
And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks is there to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back.
But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.
Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.
Judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over it will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.
And He spoke a parable to them: Is the blind able to lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?
A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who has been fitted out will be like his teacher.
And why do you look at the twig in your brother’s eye, but do not perceive the beam in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the twig that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the twig that is in your brother’s eye.
For a good tree does not produce bad fruit, nor does a bad tree produce good fruit.
For every tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
But why do you call Me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?
Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like:
He is like a man building a house, who digs deep and lays the foundation on the rock. And when the flood rises, the stream bursts against that house, and cannot shake it, for it is founded on the rock.
But he who hears and does not act is like a man who builds a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream bursts; and immediately it falls. And the ruin of that house is great.
Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered into Capernaum.
And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, having an illness, was about to die.
So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, requesting Him to come and heal his servant.
And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was worthy,
for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.
Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.
Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.
And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well; the one who had been sick.
And it happened the next day, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.
And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.
And when the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, Do not weep.
And He came and touched the coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, Young man, I say to you, Arise!
And he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.
And fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has risen up among us; and, God has visited His people.
And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.
And the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.
And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?
When the men had come to Him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?
And in the same hour He cured many of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits; and to many who were blind He gave sight.
Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them.
And blessed is he who is not made to stumble because of Me.
And when the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are in kings’ courts.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.
This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.
For I say to you, Among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser. But he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been immersed by him.
And the Lord said, To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not weep.
For John the Immerser came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a wino, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.
But wisdom is justified from all her children.
Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat.
And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,
and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the ointment.
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.
And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. So he said, Teacher, speak.
There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?
Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he forgave more. And He said to him, You have rightly judged.
Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them away with the hair of her head.
You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.
You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with ointment.
Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.
Then He said to her, Your sins are forgiven.
And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, Who is this who even forgives sins?
Then He said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.
And it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the gospel of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with Him,
and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,
and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered to Him out of their possessions.
And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke through a parable:
A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.
Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.
But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and produced fruit a hundredfold. When He had said these things He cried out, He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
And His disciples asked Him, saying, What might this parable be?
And He said, To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.
Now the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God.
Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the Word out of their hearts, that they should not believe and be saved.
And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the Word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of trial draw back away.
And the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.
But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the Word with an honest and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with steadfastness.
No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.
For nothing is concealed that will not be made manifest, nor anything hidden that will not be perceived and come into plain view.
Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from him.
Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and were not able to come up to Him through the crowd.
And it was told to Him, saying, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.
But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the Word of God and do it.
Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side of the lake. And they launched out.
But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in peril.
And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.
And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him.
And they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.
And when He stepped out onto the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but among the tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!
For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demons into the wilderness.
Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered him.
And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.
Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.
Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned.
When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.
They also who had seen it told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed.
Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.
Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,
Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.
So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.
And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to come to his house,
for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He went, the crowds pressed in on Him.
And a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any,
came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.
And Jesus said, Who touched Me? When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds are pressing and crowding You, and You say, Who touched Me?
But Jesus said, Somebody touched Me, for I know that power has gone forth out from Me.
And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.
And He said to her, Daughter, be of good courage; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.
While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher.
But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, Do not fear; only believe, and she will be made well.
And when He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, Jacob, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.
Now all wept and bewailed her; but He said, Do not weep; she has not died, but is sleeping.
And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she had died.
But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, Little girl, arise.
And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.
And her parents were astonished, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.
Then He called His twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
And He said to them, Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money; and do not have two tunics apiece.
Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.
And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them.
So they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old time prophets had risen again.
And Herod said, John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things? So he sought to see Him.
And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.
And when the day began to wear away, the twelve came and said to Him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding towns and country, and lodge and get provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.
But He said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.
For there were about five thousand men. But He said to His disciples, Make them sit down in groups of fifty.
And they did so, and made them all sit down.
Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.
So they all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.
And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples were with Him, and He asked them, saying, Who do the crowds say that I am?
So they answered and said, John the Immerser, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old time prophets has risen again.
He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said, The Christ of God.
And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,
saying, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.
Then He said to them all, If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of Me will save it.
For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or suffers loss?
For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His glory, and that of His Father, and of the holy angels.
But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God.
And it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter and John and Jacob and went up into the mountain to pray.
And as He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe was blindingly white.
And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,
who appeared in glory and spoke of His departure which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.
And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah; not knowing what he said.
While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son. Hear Him.
And after the voice came, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.
And it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him.
And behold, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.
And behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it throws him into convulsions with foaming, bruises him, and hardly ever departs from him.
So I begged Your disciples to cast it out, but they were not able.
Then Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.
And as he was still coming, the demon tore him and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,
Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they might not perceive it; and they feared to ask Him about this saying.
Then there began a reasoning among them as to which of them might be greater.
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him beside Himself,
and said to them, Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all will be great.
And John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.
But Jesus said to him, Do not forbid him, for whoever is not against us is for us.
And it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be lifted up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,
and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, to prepare for Him.
But they did not receive Him, because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.
And when His disciples Jacob and John saw this, they said, Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from Heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?
But He turned and rebuked them, and said, You do not know what sort of spirit you are of.
For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men’s lives but to save them. And they went to another village.
And it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.
And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
And He said to another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, let me first go and bury my father.
Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead, but you go and preach the kingdom of God.
And another also said, Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid farewell to those who are at my house.
But Jesus said to him, No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
After these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.
And He said to them, The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few; therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no one along the road.
And whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house.
And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it; if not, it will return to you.
And remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not go from house to house.
Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you.
And heal the sick there, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.
But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,
The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near to you.
But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to the heavens, will be thrust down to Hades.
He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.
Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.
And He said to them, I saw Satan fall like lightning from Heaven.
Behold, I give you authority to tread over serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in Heaven.
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it was pleasing in Your sight.
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
Then He turned to His disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see;
for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard it.
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
He said to him, What is written in the Law? How do you read it?
So he answered and said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.
And He said to him, You have answered rightly; do this and you will live.
But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?
Then Jesus answered and said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
And likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion.
So he went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
And on the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come back, I will repay you.
So which of these three do you suppose was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?
And he said, He who showed mercy on him. Then Jesus said to him, Go and you do likewise.
Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house.
And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His Word.
But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came to Him and said, Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.
And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things.
But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.
Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.
So He said to them, When you pray, say: Our Father in Heaven, Holy is Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us day by day our bread sufficient for the day.
And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil.
And He said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him;
and he will answer from within and say, Do not trouble me; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give to you.
I say to you, Though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will rise and give him as much as he needs.
So I say to you, Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
If a son asks for bread from any father among you, he will not give him a stone, will he? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a serpent instead of a fish, will he?
Or if he asks for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion, will he?
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.
And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke; and the multitudes marveled.
But some of them said, He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.
Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from Heaven.
But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls.
If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons with the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are at peace.
But when one stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.
He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
When an unclean spirit goes out from a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came out.
And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.
Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
And it happened, as He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised her voice and said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts which You sucked!
But He said, No; rather, blessed are those who hear the Word of God and keep it.
And while the crowds were thickly gathered together, He began to say, This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.
The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.
No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light.
The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is sound, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.
Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.
If then your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, all will be full of light, as when the shining of a lamp gives you light.
And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him. So He went in and sat down to eat.
And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner.
And the Lord said to him, Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but your inward part is full of robbery and wickedness.
Foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?
But rather give alms from what is within; and behold, all things are clean to you.
But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all kinds of herbs, and pass by justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting those.
Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like graves which are not seen, and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.
Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, Teacher, by saying these things You also insult us.
And He said, Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Therefore, you bear witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they indeed killed them, and you build their tombs.
Therefore also the wisdom of God said, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,
that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it shall be required from this generation.
Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.
And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to quarrel with Him forcefully, and to cross-examine Him about many things,
lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, in order to accuse Him.
In the meantime, when an innumerable multitude of people had gathered together, so that they trampled one another, He began to say to His disciples first of all, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
For there is nothing covered that will not be uncovered, nor hidden that will not be known.
Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops.
And I say to you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.
But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear Him who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I say to you, Fear Him!
Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Also I say to you, whoever confesses Me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God.
But he who denies Me before men will be denied before the angels of God.
And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.
Now when they bring you to the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you should say.
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.
Then one from the crowd said to Him, Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
But He said to him, Man, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?
And He said to them, Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.
Then He spoke a parable to them, saying: The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.
And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, since I have nowhere to gather my fruits?
So he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger, and there I will gather all my fruits and my goods.
And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.
But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have prepared?
So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.
And He said to His disciples, Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat; nor about the body, what you will put on.
Life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them. By how much do you surpass birds.
And which of you by being anxious is able to add one cubit to his stature?
If you then are not able to do even the least, why are you anxious about the rest?
Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If then God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more you, you of little faith?
And do not seek what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor be agitated.
For all these things the nations of the world seek after, and your Father knows that you need these things.
But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be conveyed to you.
Do not fear, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.
Sell what you have and give alms; provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old, a treasure in Heaven that does not fail, where a thief does not come near nor moth destroys.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning;
and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master, when he will return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately.
Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Truly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them.
And if he should come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.
But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be dug through.
Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Then Peter said to Him, Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or to everyone?
And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his servants, to give them their portion of food at the right time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.
Truly, I say to you that he will set him over all that he has.
But if that servant says in his heart, My master is delaying his coming, and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and be drunk,
the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not expecting him, and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him apart and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.
And that servant who knew his master’s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed, of him they will ask the more.
I came to throw fire on the earth, and what will I if it is already kindled.
But I have an immersion to be immersed with, and how distressed I am till it is accomplished.
Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth? I tell you, not at all, but rather division.
For from now on five in one house will be divided: three against two, and two against three.
Father will be divided against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
Then He also said to the multitudes, Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west, immediately you say, A thunder storm is coming; and so it happens.
And when you see the south wind blow, you say, There will be heat; and it comes to pass.
Hypocrites! You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth, but how is it you do not discern this time?
Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?
When you go with your adversary to the ruler, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
I tell you, you shall by no means depart from there till you have paid the very last mite.
There were present at that time some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
And Jesus answered and said to them, Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all other Galileans, because they suffered such things?
I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.
Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?
I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.
He also spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, Behold, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it encumber the ground?
But he answered and said to him, Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.
And see if it produces fruit. But if not, after that you can cut it down.
And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up.
But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.
And He laid hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.
But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, There are six days in which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed in them, and not on the Sabbath day.
The Lord then answered him and said, Hypocrite! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?
So ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?
And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by Him.
Then He said, What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?
It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and threw in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.
And again He said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.
And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.
Then one said to Him, Lord, are there few who are saved? And He said to them,
Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.
When once the Master of the house has risen up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, and He will answer and say to you, I do not know you, where you are from,
then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.
But He will say, I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.
There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves being thrust outside.
And they will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God.
And indeed there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.
On that same day certain Pharisees came, saying to Him, Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.
And He said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am being perfected.
Nevertheless I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be allowed to happen for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate! And truly, I say to you, You shall not see Me until the time comes when you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
And it happened, as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they watched Him closely.
And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy.
And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
But they kept silent. And He took him and healed him, and let him go.
And He answered them, saying, Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?
And they were not able to contradict Him regarding these things.
So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them:
When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;
and he who invited you and him come and say to you, Give place to this man, and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.
But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Then He also said to him who invited Him, When you give a dinner or a supper, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.
But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind.
And you will be blessed, because they do not have the means to repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!
Then He said to him, A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,
and sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come, for all things are now ready.
But they all with one accord began to decline. The first said to him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.
And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.
And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.
And the servant said, Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.
Then the master said to the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.
For I say to you that none of those men who had been invited shall taste of my supper.
And great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them,
If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.
And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.
For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it;
lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,
saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish.
Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks terms of peace.
So likewise, whoever of you does not bid farewell to all that he has is not able to be My disciple.
Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?
It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
Then all the tax collectors and the sinners came near to Him to hear Him.
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This Man receives sinners and eats with them.
So He spoke this parable to them, saying:
What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?
And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!
I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in Heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.
Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?
And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!
Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
Then He said: A certain man had two sons.
And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the estate that falls to me. So he divided to them his livelihood.
And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.
But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be destitute.
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the husks that the swine ate, and no one gave to him.
But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger.
I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you,
and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.
And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.
But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
And he said to him, Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.
But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and begged him.
So he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.
But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.
And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.
It was right that we should make merry and rejoice, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.
He also said to His disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.
So he called him and said to him, What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.
Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg.
I know what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
So he called every one of his master’s debtors to him, and said to the first, How much do you owe my master?
And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.
Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? So he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.
So the master commended the unjust steward because he had acted prudently. For the sons of this world are more prudent in their generation than the sons of light.
And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.
He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.
Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true?
And if you have not been faithful in what is another man’s, who will give you what is your own?
No servant is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. It is not possible to serve God and mammon.
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him.
And He said to them, You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.
The Law and the Prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.
But it is easier for Heaven and earth to pass away than for one point of the Law to fail.
Whoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is put away from her husband commits adultery.
There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,
desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
So it happened that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.
And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.
And besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, nor can those from there pass to us.
Then he said, I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house,
for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, that they not also come to this place of torment.
Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.
And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.
But he said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should rise from the dead.
Then He said to the disciples, It is impossible but that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to him through whom they do come!
It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.
And the apostles said to the Lord, Give us more faith.
So the Lord said, If you have faith as a mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.
But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come, sit down to eat?
But will he not rather say to him, Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink?
Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.
So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.
Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
And as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off.
And they lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
So when He saw them, He said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God,
and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan.
So Jesus answered and said, Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?
Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?
And He said to him, Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.
And when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;
nor will they say, See here; or, See there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.
And He said to the disciples, The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.
And they will say to you, Look here; or, Look there. Do not go away nor follow.
For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under the heavens, shines to the other part under the heavens, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.
But first He must suffer many things and be rejected from this generation.
And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:
They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
Even in the same way will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods are in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field, let him not return back.
Remember Lot’s wife.
Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.
I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed: the one will be taken and the other will be left.
Two will be grinding together: the one will be taken and the other left.
Two will be in the field: the one will be taken and the other left.
And they answered and said to Him, Where, Lord? And He said to them, Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.
Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not faint,
saying: There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man.
And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me from my adversary.
And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God nor regard man,
yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, that she not weary me by her continual coming.
Then the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.
And shall God not avenge His elect who cry out day and night to Him, as He is patient with them?
I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?
Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus to himself, God, I thank You that I am not like other men; extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.
I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.
And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to Heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
But Jesus called them to Him and said, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.
Truly, I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.
Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
So Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One: God.
You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.
And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth.
So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, You still lack one thing. Sell everything that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow Me.
But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.
And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God.
For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
And those who heard it said, Who then is able to be saved?
And He said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
Then Peter said, See, we have left all and followed You.
So He said to them, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, on account of the kingdom of God,
who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.
Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.
For He will be delivered up to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.
They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.
But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.
Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it might be.
So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
And those who went before rebuked him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!
So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him,
saying, What do you want Me to do for you? He said, Lord, that I may recover my sight.
Then Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. Your faith has healed you.
And immediately he recovered his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.
Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.
So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way.
And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.
So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully.
But when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.
And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor; and whatever I have taken from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.
And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;
for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.
Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.
Therefore He said: A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.
So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, Do business till I come.
But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, We do not desire to have this man reign over us.
And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
Then came the first, saying, Master, your mina has earned ten minas.
And he said to him, Well done, good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.
And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.
Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.
Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.
For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.
And he said to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.
Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?
And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.
But they said to him, Master, he has ten minas.
For I say to you, that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay them before me.
When He had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
And it came to pass, when He came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mountain called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,
saying, Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring it here.
And if anyone asks you, Why are you loosing it? you shall say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.
So those who were sent went their way and found it just as He had said to them.
And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why are you loosing the colt?
And they said, The Lord has need of him.
Then they led it to Jesus. And they threw their clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on it.
And as He went, they spread their clothes on the road.
And as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,
saying: Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in Heaven and glory in the highest!
And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.
But He answered and said to them, I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.
And as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it,
saying, If you had known, even you, at least in this your day, the things that make for your peace. But now they are hidden from your eyes.
For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and besiege you on every side,
and tear you down, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.
And He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves.
And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy Him,
and were unable to figure out anything to do; for all the people hung on to hear Him.
And it happened on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, came up
and spoke to Him, saying, Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?
But He answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:
The immersion of John; was it from Heaven or from men?
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?
But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
Then He began to tell the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.
Now at the right time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
And again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast him out.
Then the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him when they see him.
But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may become ours.
So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
He will come and destroy these vinedressers and give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, Let it not be!
And He looked at them and said, What then is this that is written: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner?
Whoever falls on that stone will be broken in pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.
And the chief priests and the scribes that same hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people; for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.
So they watched Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on one of His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.
Then they asked Him, saying, Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal regard, but teach the way of God in truth:
Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar or not?
But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why do you test Me?
Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar’s.
And He said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.
And they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.
Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,
saying: Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.
Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children.
And the second took her as wife, and he died childless.
Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died.
Last of all the woman died also.
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife is she? For the seven had her as wife.
And Jesus answered and said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage.
But those who are counted worthy to attain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;
nor is it possible for them to die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.
But even Moses showed at the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all live to Him.
Then some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have well said.
And after that they dared not question Him anymore.
And He said to them, How do they say that the Christ is the Son of David?
Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,
till I make Your enemies Your footstool.
Therefore David calls Him Lord; how is He then his Son?
Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples,
Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,
who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.
And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,
and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.
And He said, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than everyone;
for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.
And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,
As for these things which you see; the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down.
So they asked Him, saying, Teacher, therefore when will these things be? And what sign will there be when these things are about to take place?
And He said: Take heed that you not be led astray. For many will come in My name, saying, I AM, and, The time is here. Therefore do not go after them.
But when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must come to pass first, but the end is not immediately.
Then He said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
And there will be great earthquakes from place to place, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from Heaven.
But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.
But it will turn to you for testimony.
Therefore settle it in your hearts not to premeditate a defense;
for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict or resist.
And you will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.
And you will be hated by all because of My name.
But not a hair of your head shall at all perish.
By your steadfastness possess your souls.
But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the country enter her.
For these are the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.
And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring;
men’s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of the things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
And when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.
Then He spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.
So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all things take place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.
But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with giddiness, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come upon you unexpectedly.
For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.
And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the Mount of Olives.
And early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.
And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.
Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, being numbered among the twelve.
So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and commanders, how he might deliver Him to them.
And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
So he promised and sought opportunity to deliver Him to them away from the multitude.
Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed.
And He sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.
So they said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare?
And He said to them, Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters.
Then you shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?
And he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.
So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.
And when the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him.
And He said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this and divide it among yourselves;
for I say to you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God has come.
And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.
Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.
But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.
And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!
Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it might be who was about to do this thing.
And there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered greater.
And He said to them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
But not so among you; rather, he who is greater among you, let him be as the younger, and he who leads as he who serves.
For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.
But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.
And I appoint a kingdom to you, as My Father appointed unto Me,
that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon. Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.
But I have prayed for you, that your faith does not fail; and when you have returned, strengthen your brethren.
But he said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.
Then He said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.
And He said to them, When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything? And they said, Nothing.
Then He said to them, But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.
For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: And He was numbered with the transgressors. For the things concerning Me have an end.
And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough.
And coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him.
And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you do not enter into temptation.
And He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and prayed,
saying, Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.
Then an angel appeared to Him from Heaven, strengthening Him.
And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
And when He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.
And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, that you do not enter into temptation.
And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.
But Jesus said to him, Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?
When those around Him saw what was about to happen, they said to Him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
But Jesus answered and said, Permit even this. And He touched his ear and healed him.
Then Jesus said to the chief priests, commanders of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against Me. But this is your hour, and the authority of darkness.
And having arrested Him, they led Him away and brought Him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed at a distance.
Now when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.
And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, This man was also with Him.
But he denied Him, saying, Woman, I do not know Him.
And after a little while another saw him and said, You also are of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.
Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, Truly this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.
But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are saying. Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.
And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.
And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?
And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.
And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,
If You are the Christ, tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will by no means believe.
And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go.
Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.
Then they all said, Are You then the Son of God? And He said to them, You affirm that I AM.
And they said, What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.
Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him before Pilate.
And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this one perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.
Then Pilate asked Him, saying, Are You the King of the Jews? He answered him and said, It is as you say.
So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find no fault in this man.
But they were the more insistent, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.
And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some sign done by Him.
Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.
Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
And the same day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.
Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
said to them, You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him;
no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him.
I will therefore chastise Him and release Him
(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).
And they all cried out at once, saying, Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas;
who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.
Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.
But they shouted, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him!
Then he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go.
But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.
So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.
And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it behind Jesus.
And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and bewailed Him.
But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
For behold the days are coming in which they will say, Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed.
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the hills, Cover us!
For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?
There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death.
And when they had come to the place called Skull, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
And they divided His garments and cast lots.
And the people stood looking on. Moreover the rulers with them sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him vinegar,
and saying, If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.
And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.
But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, Do you not fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.
Then he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you, Today you will be with Me in Paradise.
Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.
And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. Having said this, He breathed out the spirit.
So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, Truly this was a righteous Man!
And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing the things that happened, beat their breasts and returned.
But all His acquaintances, and the women who accompanied Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man.
He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
And he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before.
And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.
And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.
And they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.
But they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.
And they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
And, as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?
He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,
saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
And they remembered His words.
And they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of Jacob, and the other women with them, who told these things to the apostles.
And their words seemed to them like idle nonsense, and they did not believe them.
But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, wondering to himself at what had happened.
Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem.
And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.
But their eyes were held, so that they did not recognize Him.
And He said to them, What kind of conversation is this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?
Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, Are You only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know the things which happened there in these days?
And He said to them, What things? So they said to Him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him.
But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.
Yes, and certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.
And when they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He is alive.
And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see Him.
Then He said to them, O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken.
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?
And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.
And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He would have gone farther.
But they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And He went in to stay with them.
And it came to pass, as He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.
And their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.
And they said to one another, Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?
So they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,
saying, The Lord truly is risen, and has appeared to Simon!
And they told about the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.
And as they were saying these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace to you.
But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they were seeing a ghost.
And He said to them, Why are you troubled? And why do reasonings arise in your hearts?
Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.
When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, He said to them, Have you any food here?
So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
And He took it and ate in their presence.
Then He said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.
And He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.
And He said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
and that repentance and remission of sins be preached in His name to all nations, beginning out of Jerusalem.
And you are witnesses of these things.
Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.
And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.
And it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into Heaven.
And they did homage to Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not lay hold of it.
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through Him might believe.
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.
He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and yet the world did not know Him.
He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those believing into His name:
who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, He who arrives after me appeared in history before me, for He existed before me.
And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.
For the Law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?
He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, I am not the Christ.
And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the Prophet? And he answered, No.
Then they said to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?
He said: I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.
Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees.
And they asked him, saying, Why then do you immerse if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?
John answered them, saying, I immerse in water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.
It is He who, arriving after me, appeared in history before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.
These things were done in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was immersing.
The next day John sees Jesus coming toward him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
This is He of whom I said, After me arrives a Man who appeared in history before me, for He existed before me.
I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I come immersing in water.
And John bore witness, saying, I saw the Spirit descending out of Heaven like a dove, and He abode upon Him.
I did not know Him, but He who sent me to immerse in water said to me, Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, this is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.
And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.
Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.
And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, What do you seek? They said to Him, Rabbi (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), where are You staying?
He said to them, Come and see. They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).
One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which is translated, the Christ).
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus looked at him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas (which is translated, Peter).
The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, Follow Me.
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law, and also the Prophets, wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him, Come and see.
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit.
Nathanael said to Him, From where do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.
Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!
Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.
And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see Heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.
On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
And both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.
And running out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.
Jesus said to her, Woman, of what concern is that to Me and you? My hour has not yet come.
His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do it.
Now there were set there six stone waterpots, according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing two or three measures each.
Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
And He said to them, Draw some out now, and take it to the master of the feast. And they brought it.
When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom,
and he said to him, Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the guests have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now.
This beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there not many days.
Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting.
And when He had made a whip out of rope, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables.
And He said to those who sold doves, Take these things away from here! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!
And His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for Your house has consumed Me.
Then the Jews answered and said to Him, What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?
Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
Then the Jews said, It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?
But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the Word which Jesus had said.
Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did.
But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew everyone,
and had no need that anyone should bear witness of man, for He knew what was in man.
There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.
Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.
Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He is not able to enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?
Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.
That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born from above.
The Spirit breathes where He wishes, and you hear His voice, but do not know where He comes from and where He goes. So is everyone who is born from the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?
Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?
Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak what We know and bear witness to what We have seen, and you do not receive Our testimony.
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you Heavenly things?
No one has ascended to Heaven but He who came down from Heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in Heaven.
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone believing into Him should not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
The one believing into Him is not judged; but the one not believing is judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.
For everyone practicing evil hates the Light and does not come to the Light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
But the one doing the truth comes to the Light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been worked in God.
After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and immersed.
And John also was immersing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were immersed.
For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
Then there arose a dispute between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purification.
And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness; behold, He is immersing, and everyone is coming to Him.
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from Heaven.
You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, I have been sent to go before Him.
He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.
He must increase, but I must decrease.
He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.
And what He has seen and heard, this He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.
He who has received His testimony has set his seal that God is true.
For He whom God has sent speaks the Words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.
The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.
The one believing into the Son has eternal life; but the one disobeying the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.
Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and immersed more disciples than John
(though Jesus Himself did not immerse, but His disciples),
He left Judea and departed again into Galilee.
And He needed to go through Samaria.
So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me a drink.
For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.
Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would give you living water.
The woman said to Him, Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?
Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?
Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will not ever thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.
The woman said to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.
Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband,
for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.
The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.
Our fathers did homage on this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the right place to do homage.
Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will do homage to the Father neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
You do homage to what you do not know; we do homage to what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.
But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will do homage to the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father seeks such to do homage to Him.
God is Spirit, and those who do homage to Him must do homage in spirit and truth.
The woman said to Him, I know that Messiah is coming (who is called Christ). When He comes, He will make known all things to us.
Jesus said to her, I AM! the One speaking to you.
And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, What do You seek? or, Why are You talking with her?
The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men,
Come, see a Man who told me everything that I ever did. Is this not the Christ?
Then they went out of the city and came to Him.
In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
But He said to them, I have food to eat of which you do not know.
Therefore the disciples said to one another, Has anyone brought Him anything to eat?
Jesus said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.
Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.
And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
For in this the saying is true: One sows and another reaps.
I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me everything that I ever did.
So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they begged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.
And many more believed through His Word.
And they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world.
Now after two days He departed from there and went into Galilee.
For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
So when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.
So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and begged Him to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
Then Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.
The nobleman said to Him, Sir, come down before my child dies!
Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.
And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told him, saying, Your son lives!
Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives. And he himself believed, and his whole household.
This again is the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.
After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.
In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water.
For an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had.
Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been there a long time, He said to him, Do you want to be made well?
The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no man to throw me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.
Jesus said to him, Rise up, take up your bed and walk.
And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked. And that day was the Sabbath.
The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.
He answered them, He who made me well said to me, Take up your bed and walk.
Then they asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed and walk?
But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in that place.
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you have been made well. Sin no more, that a worse thing not come upon you.
The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath.
But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.
Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.
Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is not able to do anything from Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does likewise.
For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.
For as the Father raises the dead and gives life, even so the Son gives life to whom He wills.
For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,
that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him.
Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My Word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life.
Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.
For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,
and has also given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice
and come forth; those who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
I am able to do nothing from Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.
If I bear witness concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.
There is another who bears witness concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which He witnesses concerning Me is true.
You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
Yet I do not receive testimony from man, but I say these things that you may be saved.
He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.
But I have a greater testimony than John’s; for the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.
And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.
And you do not have His Word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.
You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness of Me.
But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
I do not receive honor from men.
But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me. If another comes in his own name, him you will receive.
How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from God only?
Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you; Moses, in whom you have hoped.
For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?
After these things Jesus went away over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.
And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were diseased.
And Jesus went up to the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.
Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.
Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.
Philip answered Him, Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may receive even a little.
One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,
There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish; but what are they among so many?
And Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they desired.
So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.
Therefore they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.
Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.
Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone.
And when evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea,
got into the boat, and went across the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
And the sea arose because a great wind was blowing.
So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.
But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.
Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.
On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone;
however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;
when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You come here?
Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.
Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.
Then they said to Him, What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?
Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you believe into Him whom He sent.
Therefore they said to Him, What sign do You show then, that we may see and believe You? What do You work?
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread from Heaven to eat.
Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of Heaven.
For the bread of God is He who comes down from Heaven and gives life to the world.
Then they said to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.
And Jesus said to them, I am the Bread of Life. He who comes to Me shall not ever hunger, and he who believes into Me shall never ever thirst.
But I said to you that you also have seen Me and do not believe.
All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.
For I have come down out of Heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should not lose any of it, but should raise it up at the last day.
And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes into Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
The Jews then murmured about Him, because He said, I am the Bread coming down out of Heaven.
And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He says, I have come down out of Heaven?
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.
No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.
It is written in the Prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.
Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.
Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me has eternal life.
I am the Bread of Life.
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.
This is the Bread which comes down out of Heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.
I am the Living Bread which came down out of Heaven. If anyone eats of this Bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.
The Jews therefore argued among themselves, saying, How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?
Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
For My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink.
He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.
As the living Father sent Me, and I live through the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live through Me.
This is the Bread which came down out of Heaven; not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.
These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.
Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who is able to hear it?
When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured about this, He said to them, Does this offend you?
What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend where He was before?
It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh does not profit; not a thing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.
But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who were not believing, and who would betray Him.
And He said, Therefore I have said to you that no one is able to come to Me unless it has been granted to him from My Father.
From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more.
Then Jesus said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?
Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the Words of eternal life.
And we have believed and understood that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the twelve, but one of you is a devil?
He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was about to betray Him, being one of the twelve.
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
Now the Jewish Feast of Booths was at hand.
His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.
For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, make Yourself known to the world.
For neither did His brothers believe into Him.
Then Jesus said to them, My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.
The world cannot hate you; but it hates Me because I bear witness of it that its works are evil.
You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to the feast, for My time has not yet been fulfilled.
When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.
But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, Where is He?
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning Him. Some said, He is good; others said, No, rather, He leads the multitudes astray.
However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.
Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
And the Jews marveled, saying, How does this Man know letters, having never studied?
Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.
If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak out of Myself.
He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.
Did not Moses give you the Law, yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?
The people answered and said, You have a demon. Who seeks to kill You?
Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and you all marvel.
Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the Law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?
Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
Then some of them from Jerusalem said, Is this not He whom they seek to kill?
But behold, He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. Perhaps the rulers truly know that this is truly the Christ?
However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.
Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come from Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.
But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me.
Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
And many out of the crowd believed into Him, and said, When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him.
Then Jesus said to them, I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to Him who sent Me.
You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come.
Then the Jews said among themselves, Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, does He?
What is this thing that He said, You will seek Me and not find Me, and where I am you are not able to come?
On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
He who believes into Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.
But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing into Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, Truly this is the Prophet.
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Christ does not come out of Galilee.
Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
So there was a division in the crowd because of Him.
And some of them wanted to take Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, Why have you not brought Him?
The officers answered, No man ever spoke like this Man.
Then the Pharisees answered them, Have you not also been led astray?
Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed into Him?
But this crowd that does not know the Law is accursed.
Nicodemus (he who came to Jesus by night, being one of them) said to them,
Does our Law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he does?
They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and look, for no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.
And each one went to his own house.
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him; and He sat down and taught them.
And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,
they said to Him, Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act.
Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?
This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear.
So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.
And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?
She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.
Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, I am the Light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.
The Pharisees therefore said to Him, You bear witness of Yourself; Your testimony is not true.
Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness of Myself, My testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.
You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
And yet if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me.
It is also written in your Law that the testimony of two men is true.
I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears witness of Me.
Then they said to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.
These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as He taught in the temple; and no one laid hands on Him, for His hour had not yet come.
Then Jesus said to them again, I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you are not able to come.
So the Jews said, Will He kill Himself, because He says, Where I go you are not able to come?
And He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.
Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.
Then they said to Him, Who are You? And Jesus said to them, The Beginning; what I have been saying to you.
I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I heard from Him.
They did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father.
Then Jesus said to them, When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things.
And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, for I always do those things that please Him.
As He spoke these words, many believed into Him.
Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in Him, If you continue to abide in My Word, you are truly My disciples.
And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
They answered Him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have been in slavery to no one at any time. How can You say, You will be made free?
Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone practicing sin is a slave of sin.
And a slave does not remain in the house forever, but the son remains forever.
Therefore if the Son sets you free, you shall truly be free.
I know that you are Abraham’s seed, but you seek to kill Me, because My Word has no place in you.
I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father.
They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.
But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
You do the works of your father. Then they said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father; God.
Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come from Myself, but He sent Me.
Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to hear My Word.
You are of the devil as your father, and the lusts of your father you purpose to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.
And because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me.
Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?
He who is of God hears God’s Words; therefore you do not hear, because you are not of God.
Then the Jews answered and said to Him, Do we not say rightly that You are a Samaritan and have a demon?
Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.
And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks and judges.
Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone keeps My Word he shall certainly never ever see death.
Then the Jews said to Him, Now we know that You have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and You say, If anyone keeps My Word he shall never ever taste death.
Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died. Whom do You make Yourself out to be?
Jesus answered, If I glorify Myself, My honor is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.
Yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I say, I do not know Him, I shall be a liar like you; but I do know Him and keep His Word.
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.
Then the Jews said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?
Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came to be, I AM.
Then they took up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus was hidden and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.
And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth.
And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him.
It is necessary for Me to work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one is able to work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.
When He had said these things, He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay.
And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is translated, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.
Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, Is not this he who sat and begged?
Some said, This is he. Others said, He is like him. He said, I am he.
Therefore they said to him, How were your eyes opened?
He answered and said, A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.
Then they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.
They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees.
And it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.
They said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight.
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;
but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone should confess that He was Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.
Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.
So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, Give God the glory. We know that this Man is a sinner.
He answered and said, Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.
Then they said to him again, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?
He answered them, I told you already, and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you not also want to become His disciples?
Then they reviled him and said, You are His disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples.
We know that God spoke to Moses; as for this fellow, we do not know where He is from.
The man answered and said to them, Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes!
Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone reveres God and does His will, He hears him.
Since the world began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind.
If this Man were not from God, He would not be able to do anything.
They answered and said to him, You were born completely in sins, and do you teach us? And they drove him out.
Jesus heard that they had driven him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, Do you believe into the Son of God?
He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe into Him?
And Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.
And he said, Lord, I believe! And he did homage to Him.
And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.
Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, Are we blind also?
Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, We see. Therefore your sin remains.
Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.
Jesus spoke this parable, but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them.
Then Jesus said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
I am the door. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.
I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.
The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.
I am the Good Shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own.
As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.
And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must lead, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one Shepherd.
Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.
No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. This precept I have received from My Father.
Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these words.
And many of them said, He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?
Others said, These are not the words of one who has a demon. A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind.
Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.
Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.
Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness concerning Me.
But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.
My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
And I give them eternal life, and they shall never ever perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.
My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one has the power to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.
I and the Father are One.
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
Jesus answered them, Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?
The Jews answered Him, saying, For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, make Yourself God.
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your Law, I said, You are gods.
If He called them gods, to whom the Word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),
do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?
If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;
but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.
Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.
And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was immersing at first, and there He stayed.
Then many came to Him and said, John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true.
And many believed into Him there.
Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.
When Jesus heard that, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was.
Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
The disciples said to Him, Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and do You go there again?
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the Light is not in him.
These things He said, and after that He said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.
Then His disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.
However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.
Then Jesus said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.
Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.
So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.
And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house.
Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.
Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.
Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
Jesus said to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life. He who believes into Me, though he may die, he shall live.
And everyone living and believing into Me shall never ever die. Do you believe this?
She said to Him, Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.
And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, The Teacher is here and calls for you.
As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him.
Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.
Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.
Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.
And He said, Where have you laid him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.
Jesus wept.
Then the Jews said, See how He loved him.
And some of them said, Would not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have been able to keep this man from dying?
Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, Lord, by this time there is a stench, for it is four days.
Jesus said to her, Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?
Then they took away the stone from where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the crowd standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.
And when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus! Out here! Now!
And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, Loose him, and let him go.
Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed into Him.
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, What shall we do? For this Man performs many signs.
If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.
And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,
nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish.
Now this he did not say from himself; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,
and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together into one the children of God who had been scattered abroad.
Then, from that day on, they took counsel to kill Him.
Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and stayed there with His disciples.
And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.
Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, What do you think; that He will not come to the feast?
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him.
Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had died, whom He raised from the dead.
There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those reclining with Him.
Then Mary took a pound of very costly ointment of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.
Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, who was about to betray Him, said,
Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the moneybag; and he used to take what was put in it.
But Jesus said, Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.
For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.
Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
But the chief priests took counsel to put Lazarus to death also,
because on account of him many of the Jews went away and continued to believe into Jesus.
The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out: Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! The King of Israel!
And Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:
Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a donkey’s colt.
His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.
Therefore the crowd, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness.
For this reason also the crowd met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Behold, the world has gone after Him!
Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to do homage at the feast.
They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.
Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
But Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.
Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.
He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it unto eternal life.
If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, My Father will honor him.
Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me out of this hour? But for this purpose I came unto this hour.
Father, glorify Your name. Then a voice came from Heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to Him.
Jesus answered and said, This voice did not come because of Me, but because of you.
Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all to Myself.
This He said, signifying by what sort of death He was about to die.
The people answered Him, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?
Then Jesus said to them, A little while longer the Light is with you. Walk while you have the Light, that darkness not overtake you; for he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.
While you have the Light, believe into the Light, that you may become sons of Light. These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.
But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe into Him,
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
Therefore they were not able to believe, because Isaiah said again:
He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, that they should not understand with their hearts and be turned, and I should heal them.
These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.
Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, that they might not be put out of the synagogue;
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
And Jesus cried out and said, He who believes into Me, believes not into Me but into Him who sent Me.
And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.
I have come as a Light into the world, that everyone believing into Me should not remain in darkness.
And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.
He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him; the Word that I speak will judge him in the Last Day.
For I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who sent Me gives Me orders, what I should say and what I should speak.
And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has said unto Me, so I speak.
Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
And supper being ended, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray Him,
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He was come from God and was going to God,
rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.
After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
Then He comes to Simon Peter. And Peter says to Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?
Jesus answered and said to him, What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will come to understand after this.
Peter said to Him, You shall certainly not ever wash my feet! Jesus answered him, If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.
Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!
Jesus said to him, He who is bathed has no other need than to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not everyone.
For He knew who was betraying Him; therefore He said, Not everyone of you is clean.
So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and reclined again, He said to them, Do you know what I have done to you?
You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.
If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.
For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
Truly, truly, I say to you, A servant is not greater than his master; nor is the messenger greater than the one sending him.
If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.
Now I tell you before it happens, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I AM.
Truly, truly, I say to you, He who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray Me.
Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.
Now there was reclining at Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.
Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to ask who it might be of whom He spoke.
Then, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, he said to Him, Lord, who is it?
Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give a morsel when I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
And after the morsel, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.
But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him.
For some thought, because Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy those things we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.
Having received the morsel, he then went out immediately. And it was night.
So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him at once.
Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you are not able to come, so now I say to you.
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I love you, that you also love one another.
By this everyone will know that you are My disciples, if you have love mutually with one another.
Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, where are You going? Jesus answered him, Where I am going you are not able to follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterward.
Peter said to Him, Lord, why am I not able to follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.
Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster shall not crow till you will deny Me three times.
Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.
In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also.
And where I go you know, and the way you know.
Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You go, and how can we know the way?
Jesus said to him, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.
Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.
Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how do you say, Show us the Father?
Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me does the works.
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or if not, believe Me on account of the works themselves.
Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes into Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.
And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.
If you love Me, keep My commandments.
And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may remain with you forever;
the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you.
I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.
Yet a little while and the world sees Me no more, but you see Me. Because I live, you will live also.
In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and make Myself known to him.
Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, Lord, how is it that You will make Yourself known to us, and not at all to the world?
Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My Word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.
He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the Word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.
These things I have spoken to you while yet being present with you.
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.
Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
You have heard Me say to you, I am going away and coming back to you. If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, I am going to the Father, for My Father is greater than I.
And now I have told you before it happens, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.
I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me.
But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded Me, thus I do. Arise, let us go from here.
I am the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser.
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
You are already clean because of the Word which I have spoken to you.
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me.
I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for apart from Me there is not a thing you are able to do.
If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.
If you abide in Me, and My Words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall happen unto you.
In this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; thus you will be My disciples.
As the Father loves Me, I also love you; continue in My love.
If you keep My commandments, you will continue in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and continue in His love.
These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.
This is My commandment, that you love one another as I love you.
Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.
You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.
No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I hear from My Father I make known to you.
You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.
These things I command you, that you love one another.
If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before you.
If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
Remember the Word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My Word, they will keep yours also.
But all these things they will do to you on account of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me.
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
He who hates Me hates My Father also.
If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin. But now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father.
Moreover, that the Word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated Me without a cause.
But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness concerning Me.
And you also will bear witness, because you are with Me from the beginning.
These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble.
They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service.
And these things they will do to you because they do not know the Father nor Me.
But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.
But now I am going away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?
But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.
Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.
And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me;
concerning righteousness, because I go to My Father and you no longer see Me;
concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.
However, when He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He will guide you into all Truth; for He will not speak things originating from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will make known to you things to come.
He will glorify Me, for He will receive from what is Mine and make it known to you.
All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will receive from what is Mine and make it known to you.
A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go away to the Father.
Then His disciples said among themselves, What is this that He says to us, A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me; and, because I go to the Father?
They said therefore, What is this that He says, A little while? We do not understand what He says.
Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, Do you seek answers among yourselves that I said, A little while, and you do not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me?
Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will become joy.
A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she gives birth to the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a person has been born into the world.
Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one takes your joy from you.
And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.
Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.
These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will clearly make known to you concerning the Father.
In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;
for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.
I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.
His disciples said to Him, Behold, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech.
Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.
Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?
Behold, the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you are scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.
These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction; but be of good courage, I have overcome the world.
Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to Heaven, and says: Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,
as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You sent.
I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You gave Me to do.
And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world existed.
I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your Word.
Now they have known that all things, whatever You gave Me, are from You.
For I have given to them the Words which You have given Me; and they received them, and surely know that I came forth from You; and they believe that You sent Me.
I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.
And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.
And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.
While I was with them in the world, I cared for them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have guarded; and not one of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.
I have given them Your Word; and the world hates them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil.
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
Sanctify them in Your Truth. Your Word is Truth.
As You sent Me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
And on their behalf I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified in Truth.
I do not pray concerning these alone, but also concerning those who will believe into Me through their word;
that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me.
And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:
I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made complete in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me, and love them as You love Me.
Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You gave Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
O righteous Father, the world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me.
And I have made known to them Your name, and will make it known, that the love with which You love Me may be in them, and I in them.
When Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples over the Brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered.
And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; for Jesus often came together there with His disciples.
Then Judas, having received a company of troops, and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
Jesus therefore, knowing all things coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom do you seek?
They answered Him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said to them, I AM! And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them.
Now when He said to them, I AM, they fell backwards and were thrown to the ground.
Then He asked them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way;
that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of those whom You gave Me I have lost not one.
Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
So Jesus said to Peter, Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?
Then the company of troops and the commander and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him.
And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year.
Now it was Caiaphas who gave counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in.
Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, Are you not also one of this Man’s disciples? He said, I am not.
Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.
The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.
Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.
Why do you question Me? Ask those who have heard Me what I said to them. Behold, they know what I said.
And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Do You answer the high priest this way?
Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?
Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. Therefore they said to him, Are you not also one of His disciples? He denied it and said, I am not.
One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with Him?
Peter then denied again; and immediately a rooster crowed.
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early. But they themselves did not go into the Praetorium, that they should not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.
Pilate then went out to them and said, What accusation do you bring against this Man?
They answered and said to him, If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.
Then Pilate said to them, You take Him and judge Him according to your Law. Therefore the Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,
that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, signifying by what death He would die.
Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, Are You the King of the Jews?
Jesus answered him, Do you say this from yourself, or did others tell you this concerning Me?
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.
Pilate therefore said to Him, Are You a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the Truth. Everyone who is of the Truth hears My voice.
Pilate said to Him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, I find no fault in Him at all.
But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
Then they all cried again, saying, Not this Man, but Barabbas! Now Barabbas was a robber.
So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe,
and said, Hail, King of the Jews! And they struck Him with their hands.
Pilate then went out again, and said to them, Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.
Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, Behold the Man!
Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify Him, crucify Him! Pilate said to them, You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.
Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more terrified,
and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and authority to release You?
Jesus answered, You could have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.
From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar’s friend. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold your King!
But they cried out, Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar!
Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led Him away.
And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,
where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.
And Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, He said, I am the King of the Jews.
Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots. Therefore the soldiers did these things.
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, Woman, behold your son.
Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour that disciple took her into his own home.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst!
Now a vessel full of vinegar was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth.
So when Jesus had received the vinegar, He said, It has been finished! And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him.
But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
And he who has seen has borne witness, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he speaks the truth, so that you may believe.
For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of His bones shall be broken.
And again another Scripture says, They shall look on Him whom they pierced.
After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. And he came and took the body of Jesus.
And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.
So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.
Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
Then she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.
Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb.
So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.
And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,
and the face cloth that had been around His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.
Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed.
For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that it was necessary for Him to rise again from the dead.
Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.
But Mary stood outside near the tomb weeping, and as she wept she stooped down into the tomb.
And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.
And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.
Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him, Rabboni! (which is to say, Teacher)
Jesus said to her, Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.
Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace to you.
And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
So Jesus said to them again, Peace to you. As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.
And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; whatever you lay hold upon, it is held fast.
But Thomas, called the Twin, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.
The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. So he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not ever believe.
And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace to you.
Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here, and look at My hands; and bring your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.
And Thomas answered and said to Him, My Lord and my God!
Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those not seeing and yet believing.
And truly Jesus did many other signs before His disciples, which are not written in this book;
but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name.
After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He showed Himself:
Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We are coming with you also. They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
Then Jesus said to them, Children, you do not have any fish, do you? They answered Him, No.
And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he was naked), and plunged into the sea.
But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.
Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread.
Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish which you have caught now.
Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.
Jesus said to them, Come and eat breakfast. Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, Who are You? knowing that it was the Lord.
Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.
This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.
So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.
He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord; You know that I am deeply fond of You. He said to him, Tend My sheep.
He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonah, are you deeply fond of Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Are you deeply fond of Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You discern all things; You know that I am deeply fond of You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep.
Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.
This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, Follow Me.
Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one who betrays You?
Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, But Lord, what about this man?
Jesus said to him, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.
Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple does not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, If I intend for him to remain till I come, what is that to you?
This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and writes these things; and we know that his testimony is true.
And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
The former account I made, O Theophilus, of everything that Jesus began both to do and teach,
until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen,
to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, which, He said, you have heard from Me;
for John truly immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
And He said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority.
But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,
who also said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into Heaven, will so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven.
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey.
And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; Jacob of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas of Jacob.
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
Men and brethren, this Scripture needed to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who took Jesus;
for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.
(Now this man procured a field out of the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails poured out.
And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akeldama; that is, Field of Blood.)
For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his dwelling place become desolate, and let him not live in it; and, Let another take his office.
Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the immersion of John until the day when He was taken up from us, it is necessary for one of these to become a witness with us of His resurrection.
And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
And they prayed and said, You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen
to take part in this ministry and apostleship which Judas abandoned, that he might go to his own place.
And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
And when the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
And suddenly there came a sound from Heaven, as being borne along by a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, being distributed, and it sat upon each one of them.
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were bewildered, because everyone heard them speaking in his own dialect.
And they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galileans?
And how is it that we hear, each in our own dialect in which we were born?
Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene, visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabs; we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, Whatever would this wish to be?
Others mocking said, They are full of sweet wine.
But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.
For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.
But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out from My Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.
And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.
I will present wonders in the heavens above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
And it shall come to pass that everyone who shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved by God to you by works of power, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know;
Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death;
whom God raised up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
For David says concerning Him: I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for He is at my right hand, that I not be shaken.
Therefore my heart rejoices, and my tongue is glad; moreover my flesh also dwells in hope.
For You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.
Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne;
he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.
This Jesus, God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.
Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.
For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,
until I make Your enemies Your footstool.
Therefore let all the house of Israel understand with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be immersed in the name of Jesus Christ to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.
And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.
Then those who gladly received his word were immersed; and that day about three thousand souls were added.
And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles.
Now all the believers were together, and had all things in common,
and sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to each person, as anyone had need.
So continuing day by day with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.
Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple;
who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms.
And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, Look at us.
So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
Then Peter said, Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them; walking, leaping, and praising God.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
And they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
And as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon’s, greatly amazed.
And when Peter saw it, he answered the people: Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this one? Or why do you gaze on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to set Him free.
But you denied the Holy and Just One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
and killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised up from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
And His Name, by faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
But those things which God foretold through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.
Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,
and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before,
whom Heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God has spoken through the mouth of all His holy prophets since the past ages.
For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God will raise up to you a Prophet like me from among your brethren. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He says to you.
And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.
You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
Having raised up His Son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the temple commander, and the Sadducees came near them,
being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
And they laid hands on them, and put them into custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
However, many of those who heard the Word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes,
as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
And standing them in the midst, they asked, By what sort of power or by what sort of name have you done this?
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:
If we this day are examined for a good deed done to an infirm man, by what means he has been made well,
let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in Him this man stands here before you whole.
This is the Stone which was counted as nothing by you builders, which has become the Head of the Corner.
Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under Heaven given among men that is required for us to be saved.
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they understood that they were with Jesus.
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
saying, What shall we do to these men? For indeed, that a notable sign has been done through them is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it.
But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, that from now on they speak to no one in this name.
And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.
For we are not able not to speak the things which we have seen and heard.
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done.
For the man was over forty years old on whom this sign of healing had been performed.
And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: Lord, You are God, who made the heavens and earth and the sea, and all that is in them,
who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: Why did the nations rage, and the people devise vain things?
The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers themselves were gathered against the Lord and against His Christ.
For truly against Your holy Son Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together
to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done.
And now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants to speak Your Word with all boldness,
by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Son Jesus.
And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.
Now the multitude of those believing were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.
And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.
Nor was there anyone needy among them; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
and placed them at the apostles’ feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.
And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus,
having land, sold it, and brought the money and placed it at the apostles’ feet.
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.
And he kept back part of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and placed it at the apostles’ feet.
But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the proceeds of the land for yourself?
While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you put this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.
Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things.
And the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.
Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? She said, Yes, for so much.
Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.
Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband.
So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.
And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch.
Moreover none of the rest dared join them, but the people magnified them.
And more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,
so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and mattresses, that even if the shadow of Peter came passing by, it might overshadow some of them.
Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with zeal,
and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.
But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the Words of this Life.
And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported,
saying, Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.
Now when the high priest, the temple commander, and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed as to whatever would become of this.
Then one came and reported to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
Then the commander went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, that they might not be stoned.
And when they had brought them, they stood them before the council. And the high priest asked them,
saying, Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man’s blood upon us.
But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men.
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you laid hands on, hanging Him on a tree.
Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins.
And we are His witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.
When they heard this, they were cut to the heart and took counsel to do away with them.
Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law highly esteemed by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.
And he said to them: Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.
For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.
After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.
And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;
but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it; lest you even be found to fight against God.
And they agreed with him, and when they had summoned the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.
And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus Christ.
Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily service.
Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not desirable that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables.
Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this need;
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word.
And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,
whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.
And the Word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Libertines (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen.
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
Then they secretly induced men to say, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.
And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, seized him, and led him into the council.
They also set up false witnesses who said, This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the Law;
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
And all who sat in the council, gazing at him, saw his face as if it were the face of an angel.
Then the high priest said, Tell us whether you hold thus to these things?
And he said, Brethren and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
and said to him, Get out of your country and from your relatives, and come to a land that I will show you.
Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell.
And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even enough to set his foot on. But even when Abraham had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him.
But God spoke in this way: that his seed would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress them four hundred years.
And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge, said God, and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.
And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.
And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him
and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
Now a famine and great distress came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no food.
But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
And the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph’s kindred became known to Pharaoh.
Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five souls.
So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers.
And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
till another king arose who did not know Joseph.
This man dealt craftily with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their babies, so that they might not live.
At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God; and he was brought up in his father’s house for three months.
But when he was set out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son.
And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.
Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel.
And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian.
For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand.
And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?
But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
Do you not want to do away with me in the same way you did the Egyptian yesterday?
Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became an alien in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.
And when forty years had passed, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.
When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice of the Lord came to him,
I am the God of your fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses becoming terrified, dared not look.
Then the Lord said to him, Loosen the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.
I have given attention to see the affliction of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.
This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? is the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.
He led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear.
This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, the one who received the living Words to give to us,
whom our fathers did not desire to obey, but thrust him away. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,
saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.
And they made a calf in those days, led a sacrifice up to the idol, and made merry in the works of their own hands.
Then God turned and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the Prophets: Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which you made to do homage; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,
which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,
who found favor before God and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
But Solomon built Him a house.
However, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says:
Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build for Me? says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?
Has My hand not made all these things?
You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always oppose the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.
Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they, who received the Law by the command of angels and did not keep it, killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One,
of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers.
When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.
But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into Heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
and said, Behold, I see the Heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.
Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord;
and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid aside their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
And they stoned Stephen as he was invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
And he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not charge them with this sin. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
Now Saul was consenting to his death. At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.
Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the Word.
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.
And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the many signs which he did.
For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
And there was great joy in that city.
But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously used sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great,
to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
And they heeded him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time.
But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were immersed.
Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the works of power and signs which were done.
Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,
who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
For as yet He had not fallen on any of them. They had only been immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
saying, Give me this authority also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.
But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!
You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.
Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
For I see that you are in bitter wickedness and bound by unrighteousness.
Then Simon answered and said, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.
So when they had testified and preached the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is desert.
So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high office under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to do homage,
was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet.
Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.
So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?
And he said, How can I, unless someone guides me? And he summoned Philip to come up and sit with him.
The place in the Scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He opened not His mouth.
In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.
So the eunuch answered Philip and said, I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.
Now as they went down the road, they came upon some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water. What prevents me from being immersed?
Then Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he immersed him.
Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.
But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.
Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder toward the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
and asked for letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
But as he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from Heaven.
And he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?
And he said, Who are You, Sir? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute. It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
So he, trembling and astonished, said, Lord, what do You have in mind for me to do? Then the Lord said to him, Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.
And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a sound but seeing no one.
Then Saul was lifted up from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, here I am, Lord.
So the Lord said to him, Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prays.
And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.
And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind everyone who calls on Your name.
But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen vessel unto Me to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.
For I will show him how many things he must suffer for My name.
And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was immersed.
So when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.
And immediately he preached Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.
Then all who heard were amazed, and said, Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to do away with him.
But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him.
Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a basket.
And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to be joined to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple.
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out.
And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed with the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him.
When the brethren found out, they led him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
Now it came to pass, as Peter went everywhere, that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda.
There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed.
And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed. Then he arose immediately.
So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did.
But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, begging him not to delay in coming to them.
Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.
But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
Then he gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.
So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,
a devout man and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always.
About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, Cornelius.
And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, lord? So he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.
Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter.
He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you need to do.
And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually.
So when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.
The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
And he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance
and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth.
In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
And a voice came to him, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.
But Peter said, By no means, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.
And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed do not consider unclean.
This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.
Now while Peter was perplexed within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate.
And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.
While Peter pondered concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you.
Arise therefore, go down and go with them without hesitating; for I have sent them.
Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek. For what reason are you here?
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.
Then he invited them in and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends.
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and did homage.
But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself am also a man.
And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.
Then he said to them, You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?
So Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
and said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God.
Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.
So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.
Then Peter opened his mouth and said: In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.
But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.
The Word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all);
that Word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the immersion which John preached:
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.
And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they did away with, hanging Him on a tree.
God raised Him up on the third day, and gave to Him to become manifest,
not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.
And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead.
To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, everyone believing into Him will receive remission of sins.
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon each one who heard the Word.
And those of the circumcision who were believers, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles.
For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,
Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?
And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.
Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the Word of God.
And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,
saying, You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!
But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying:
I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me.
When I had fixed my eyes on it and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
And I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.
But I said, By no means, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.
But the voice answered me again from Heaven, What God has cleansed do not consider unclean.
Now this was done three times, and the whole thing was drawn up again into heaven.
At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
Then the Spirit spoke to me to go with them without hesitating. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.
And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter,
who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.
And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.
Then I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.
If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?
When they heard these things they kept silent; and they glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life.
Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one but the Jews only.
But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.
Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.
Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.
And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.
Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and gave a sign through the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.
Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.
This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to oppress some from the church.
And he killed Jacob the brother of John with the sword.
And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. (And it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.)
So when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after Passover.
Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church.
And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.
And behold, the Angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, Arise quickly! And his chains fell off his hands.
Then the Angel said to him, Gird yourself and bind on your sandals; and he did so. And He said to him, Throw around your garment and follow Me.
So he went out and followed Him, and did not know that what was done through the Angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the Angel departed from him.
And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His Angel, and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.
So, when he had considered this, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying.
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to listen.
And when she recognized Peter’s voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate.
But they said to her, You are beside yourself. Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, It is his angel.
But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.
But motioning to them with his hand to keep silent, he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go, tell these things to Jacob and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place.
Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter.
And when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that they should be led away to death. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.
Now Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the king’s personal aide their friend, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food by the king’s country.
So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his platform and gave an oration to them.
And the people kept shouting, The voice of a god and not of a man!
And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.
But the Word of God grew and increased.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their service, and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark.
Now in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.
Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away.
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
And when they arrived in Salamis, they preached the Word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant.
Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,
who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
and said, O full of all deceit and all mischief, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?
And now, lo, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.
And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.
Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:
The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it.
Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness.
And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.
After that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He bore witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.
From this man’s seed, according to promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;
when John had first preached, before His coming on the scene, an immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.
And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think I am? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
Men and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the Word of this salvation is sent.
For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him.
And though they found no cause of death in Him, they asked Pilate that He should be done away with.
Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
But God raised Him from the dead.
He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.
And we preach the gospel to you; the promise which was made to the fathers.
God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: You are My Son, today I have begotten You.
And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: I will give you the holy and faithful promises of David.
Therefore He also says in another place: You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;
but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.
Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this One is preached to you the remission of sins;
and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.
Beware therefore, that what has been spoken in the Prophets may not come upon you:
Behold, you despisers, marvel and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though one were to declare it to you.
So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
And on the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the Word of God.
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul.
Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
For thus the Lord has commanded us: I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed unto eternal life believed.
And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the region.
But the Jews stirred up the devout and influential women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders.
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and spoke in such a manner that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.
Then, indeed, they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, Who was bearing witness to the Word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done through their hands.
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part were with the Jews, but part with the apostles.
And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to inflict injury and stone them,
they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region.
And they were preaching the gospel there.
And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
This man heard Paul speaking; who, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be saved,
said with a loud voice, Stand up straight on your feet! And he leaped and walked.
Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men!
And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, determined to sacrifice with the multitudes.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed in among the multitude, crying out
and saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,
who in past generations allowed all nations to go in their own ways.
Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving us rain from the heavens and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.
Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to have died.
However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must enter the kingdom of God through many afflictions.
So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord into whom they believed.
And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
And when they had preached the Word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
And when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
So they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.
And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.
Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them to go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, concerning this question.
So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the brethren.
And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them.
But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.
And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.
And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the Word of the gospel and believe.
So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,
and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
But we believe through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved, in the same manner as they.
Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul recounting how many signs and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles.
And after they had become silent, Jacob answered, saying, Men and brethren, listen to me:
Simon has declared how God at the first looked upon the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.
And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:
After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up;
so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the Lord who does all these things.
Known to God from eternity are all His works.
Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God,
but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, from sexual perversion, from things strangled, and from blood.
For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.
Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.
They wrote this letter by them: The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.
Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, You must be circumcised and keep the Law; to whom we gave no such commandment;
it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
men who have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.
For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.
So when they were sent away, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.
When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.
And Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.
And after they had stayed there for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.
However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there.
Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the Word of the Lord, with many others also.
Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the Word of the Lord, and see how they are holding on.
Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.
But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.
And the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;
and Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.
And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was Greek.
He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium.
Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek.
And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.
So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number day by day.
Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the Word in Asia.
After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.
So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A man of Macedonia stood and begged him, saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us.
And after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.
Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,
and from there to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days.
And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who assembled there.
And a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who revered God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul.
And when she and her household were immersed, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. So she persuaded us.
And it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortunetelling.
This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.
And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly disturbed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out that very instant.
But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.
And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;
and they proclaim customs which are not lawful for us to receive or observe, being Romans.
Then the multitude rose up against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods.
And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.
Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.
And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s bonds were loosened.
And the jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself.
But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
And he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
So they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.
And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were immersed.
And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.
So the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.
But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, being Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they drive us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and lead us out.
And the floggers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
Then they came and begged them and brought them out, and asked them to depart out of the city.
So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
And Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
explaining and setting forth that the Christ needed to suffer and rise again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas.
But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious, took some of the baser sort from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and came upon the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, These who have turned the world upside down have come here, too;
whom Jason has received, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.
And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.
So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things are so.
Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, both prominent women and men.
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.
Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go as though toward the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.
And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly, they departed.
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.
Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.
Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What does this empty talker want to say? And others, He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign demons, because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which you speak?
For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.
For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.
Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you fear the gods;
for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your devotion, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One to whom you show reverence without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:
God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.
Nor is He served with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.
And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell everywhere on the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,
so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;
for in Him we live and move and exist, as also some of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.
Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine is like gold or silver or stone, something engraved by art and man’s devising.
Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,
because He has established a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has appointed. He has given assurance of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead.
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some ridiculed, while others said, We will hear you again concerning this matter.
So Paul departed from their midst.
However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them.
And, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers.
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.
And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain man named Justus, one who revered God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.
Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing and believing, were immersed.
Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;
for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.
And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.
And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,
saying, This fellow persuades men to revere God contrary to the Law.
And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you.
But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such matters.
And he drove them from the judgment seat.
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things.
So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent,
but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.
And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.
After he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.
This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the immersion of John.
So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
And when he was minded to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, encouraging the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;
for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples
he said to them, Since you believe, did you receive the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.
So he said to them, Into what then were you immersed? And they said, Into John’s immersion.
Then Paul said, John indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.
When they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
Now the men were about twelve in all.
And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God.
But when some were hardened and did not obey, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.
And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
Now God worked unusual works of power through the hands of Paul,
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out from them.
Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.
Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.
And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are you?
Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them and subdued them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds.
Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. And they counted up the value of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
So the Word of the Lord grew mightily and was powerful.
When these things were completed, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.
And about that time there was no small disturbance about the Way;
for a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no small profit to the craftsmen.
He assembled them with the workers of similar occupation, and said: Men, you know that we have our wealth by this trade.
Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.
So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world revere.
Now when they heard this, they were full of anger and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s travel companions.
And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him.
Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater.
Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people.
But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!
And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.
For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
For we are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no reason which we may give to account for this riot.
And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself, embraced them, and departed to go to Macedonia.
Now when he had passed through that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece
and stayed three months. And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia; also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.
These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.
But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.
And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were gathered together.
And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.
But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.
Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed.
And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.
Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so it was arranged, intending himself to go on foot.
And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.
And we sailed from there, and the next day came opposite Chios. And the following day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day we came to Miletus.
For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.
So, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I lived among you all the time,
serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;
how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,
testifying both to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.
But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
And behold now, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
Therefore I testify to you this day that I am blameless from the blood of everyone.
For I have not shrunk back from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.
For I know this, that after my departure vicious wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.
Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.
So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel.
Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have served for my necessities, and for those who were with me.
I have shown you in everything, by laboring like this, that we need to support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
Then they all wept greatly, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him again and again,
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.
And when we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with women and children, till we were out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed.
When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.
And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.
On the next day we who were Paul’s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
And when he had come to us, he took Paul’s waistband, binding his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this waistband, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Then Paul answered, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
So when he would not be persuaded, we kept quiet, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem.
Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them Mnason, a certain Cypriot, one of the original disciples, with whom we were to lodge.
And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
And on the following day Paul went in with us to Jacob, and all the elders were present.
And when he had greeted them, he related one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, You see, brother, how many countless Jews there are who believe, and they also are all zealous for the Law;
but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.
What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.
Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have a vow.
Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.
But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion.
Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to declare the fulfillment of the days of purification, until an offering should be brought for each one of them.
Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,
crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the Law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.
(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
And all the city was in a commotion; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.
Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done.
And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another. So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be led away into the barracks.
And when he reached the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.
For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him!
Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, May I speak to you? He replied, Do you speak Greek?
Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up trouble and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?
But Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.
So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
Brethren and fathers, hear my defense before you now.
And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, they kept all the more silent. Then he said:
I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers’ Law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today.
I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,
as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring even those who were there, bound, to Jerusalem to be punished.
Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from Heaven shone around me.
And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?
So I answered, Who are You, Sir? And He said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.
And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the words uttered by Him who spoke to me.
So I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.
And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.
Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,
came to me; and he stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And at that same instant I looked up at him.
Then he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice out of His mouth.
For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
And now why are you waiting? Arise and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
And it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance
and saw Him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.
So I said, Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those believing on You.
And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.
Then He said to me, Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.
And they listened to him until this word, and then they raised their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he is not fit to live!
Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes and threw dust into the air,
the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined by scourging, so that he might know for what reason they shouted so against him.
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not condemned by trial?
When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.
Then the commander came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.
And the commander answered, With a large sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was free born.
Then immediately those who were about to examine him stood away from him; and the commander was also afraid after he fully knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them.
Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
Then Paul said to him, God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the Law, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the Law?
And those who stood by said, Do you revile God’s high priest?
Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.
But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!
And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.
For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees’ party arose and protested, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
And when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks.
But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified of Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome.
And when it was day, some of the Jews made a pact and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul.
And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy.
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
Now you, therefore, together with the council, communicate to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make more specific inquiries concerning him; and we are ready to kill him before he comes near.
So when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, Lead this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.
So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, Paul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.
Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside and asked privately, What is it that you have to tell me?
And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to make more specific inquiries about him.
But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.
So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded him, Tell no one that you have disclosed these things to me.
And he summoned two centurions, saying, Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;
and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
And he wrote a letter in the following manner:
Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. Coming with the troops I rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.
And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council.
I found out that he was accused concerning questions of their law, but had nothing charged against him deserving of death or bonds.
And when it was disclosed to me that the Jews were about to carry out a plot against the man, I sent him immediately to you, and also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him. Farewell.
Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks.
When they came to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
And when the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,
he said, I will fully hear you when your accusers also have come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s Praetorium.
And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. These made declarations to the governor against Paul.
And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your providence,
we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I entreat you to hear, by your fairness, a few words from us.
For we have found this man pestilent, a mover of insurrection among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and were determined to judge him according to our law.
But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,
commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.
And the Jews also assented, alleging that these things were so.
Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully make my defense,
because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to do homage.
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, neither in the synagogues nor throughout the city.
Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.
I have hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.
This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience that is blameless toward God and men.
Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,
in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a crowd nor with tumult.
They ought to have been here before you to accuse if they had anything against me.
Or else let these themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,
unless it is for this one statement which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.
And when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he postponed judgment and said, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will examine your case.
So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.
And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.
Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.
But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.
Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews made a statement to him against Paul; and they petitioned him,
asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem; while they lay in ambush along the road to kill him.
But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there shortly.
Therefore, he said, let those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, whatever there might be in him.
And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.
And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many serious complaints against Paul, which they were not able to prove.
Defending himself he said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I trespassed in anything at all.
But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?
Then Paul said, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.
For if I have done wrong, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.
Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.
And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.
And when they had been there many days, Festus set forth Paul’s case before the king, saying: There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,
about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him.
To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to make a defense concerning the charge against him.
Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.
When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed,
but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.
But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.
So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus’ command Paul was led out.
And Festus said: King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer.
But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.
But I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write.
For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.
Then Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself:
I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall give a defense before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,
especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.
My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know.
They knew me from the first, if they were willing to bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.
To this promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.
Why should it be thought incredible by you if God raises the dead?
Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from Heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
So I said, Who are You, Sir? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.
But arise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things in which I will appear to you.
I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,
to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.
Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the Heavenly vision,
but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance.
For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come to be;
that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.
Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!
But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and sobriety.
For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things are hidden from him, since this thing was not done in a corner.
King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.
Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to become a Christian.
And Paul said, I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these bonds.
When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them;
and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, This man is doing nothing deserving of death or bonds.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.
And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment.
So, boarding a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.
And the next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.
And when we had set sail from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.
And when we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.
And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the fast was already past, Paul exhorted them,
saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.
Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.
And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there.
And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising anchor, they sailed close by Crete.
But not long after, a tempestuous wind arose, called Euroclydon.
So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her be carried along.
And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the boat with difficulty.
When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the quicksands, they struck sail and so were driven.
And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship.
On the third day we threw the ship’s tackle overboard with our own hands.
Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was then taken away.
But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, Men, you should have heeded me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.
And now I urge you to be of good cheer, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
For there stood by me this night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve,
saying, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.
Therefore be of good cheer, men, for I believe God, that it will be just as it was told me.
However, we must fall on a certain island.
Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land.
And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.
Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and wished for day to come.
And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it fall off.
And as day was about to dawn, Paul begged them all to take food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing.
Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, because not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.
And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat.
Then they all became more encouraged, and also took food themselves.
And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six souls on the ship.
So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.
And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a certain bay with a beach, onto which they purposed to run the ship if they were able.
And they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder bands; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore.
But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.
And the soldiers’ purpose was to kill the prisoners, that not any of them should swim away and escape.
But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land;
and for the rest to go, some on boards and some on parts of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land.
And when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Melita.
And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.
But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.
But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
In that region there were lands of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and lodged us for three days hospitably.
And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.
So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed.
They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.
After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island.
And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.
From there we circled round and came to Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli,
where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days. And thus we went toward Rome.
And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
And it came to pass after three days that Paul called those being chief of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: Men and brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.
But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.
For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
Then they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you.
But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.
So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.
And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
So when they did not agree among themselves, they were dismissed after Paul had said one word: The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,
saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you will see, and not perceive;
for the heart of this people has grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, that they should not see with their eyes nor hear with their ears, that they should not understand with their hearts and turn, and I should heal them.
Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had much discussion among themselves.
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him,
preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, without hindrance.
Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called an apostle, separated to the gospel of God
which He promised before through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,
concerning His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh,
and defined as the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.
Through Him we have received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all nations for His name,
among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;
to all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout all the world.
For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,
making request if, by any means now at last, I may prosper by the will of God to come to you.
For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be strengthened;
that is, that I may be encouraged together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often planned to come to you (but was prevented until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.
I am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise.
So, as much as is in me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who is believing, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; even as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
because what may be known of God is clearly recognized by them, for God has revealed it to them.
For ever since the creation of the world the unseen things of Him are clearly perceived, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,
because, although they know God, they do not glorify Him as God, nor are thankful, but become vain in their reasonings, and their stupid hearts are darkened.
Professing to be wise, they become foolish,
and change the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.
Therefore God also gives them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,
who change the truth of God into the lie, and fear and serve the created things more than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
For this reason God gives them up to vile passions. For even their women change the natural use for what is contrary to nature.
Likewise also the men, abandoning the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men with men performing what is shameful, and receiving the retribution within themselves, the penalty which is fitting for their error.
And even as they do not like to have God in their full true knowledge, God gives them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;
being filled with every unrighteousness, sexual perversion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, depravity; whisperers,
defamers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
without understanding, untrustworthy, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;
who, knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do them, but also approve of those who practice them.
Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judges, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.
And do you think this, O man, you who judges those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?
Or do you despise the riches of His kindness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?
But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
who will render to each one according to his works:
eternal life to those who steadfastly doing good, seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility;
but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; anger and wrath,
trouble and anguish, on every soul of man who produces evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;
but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
For there is no partiality with God.
For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned within the Law will be judged through the Law
(for not the hearers of the Law are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified;
for when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, by nature do the things in the Law, these, although not having the Law, are a law to themselves,
who show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts meanwhile accusing or else excusing themselves)
in the day when God will judge the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.
Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest on the Law, and make your boast in God,
and know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the Law,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and truth in the Law.
You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?
You who say, Do not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
You who make your boast in the Law, do you dishonor God through transgressing the Law?
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteousness of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?
And will not the naturally uncircumcised, if he fulfills the Law, judge you who, though having the writings and circumcision, are a transgressor of the Law?
For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh;
but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God.
What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?
Much in every way: chiefly because they were entrusted with the Words of God.
For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?
Let it not be! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar. As it is written: That You may be found just in Your words, and may win the case when You are judged.
But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust who lays on wrath? (I speak as a man.)
Let it not be! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?
For if in my lie, the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?
And why not say (as we are slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil that good may come? Their condemnation is just.
What then? Do we surpass them? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.
As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one;
there is none who understands; there is none who seeks after God.
They have all turned aside; they have together become unprofitable; there is none who does good, no, not one.
Their throat is an open tomb; with their tongues they have practiced deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips;
whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood;
destruction and misery are in their ways;
and the way of peace they have not known.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Now we know that whatever the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
Therefore by the deeds of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the Law is the full true knowledge of sin.
But now the righteousness of God apart from the Law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,
even the righteousness of God, through the faith of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all who believe. For there is no difference;
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, to give evidence of His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed,
to prove at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who is of the faith of Jesus.
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the Law.
Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,
since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
Do we then annul the Law through faith? Let it not be! No rather, we establish the Law.
What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?
For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Now to him who works, the wages are not counted according to grace but according to debt.
But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted unto righteousness,
just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works:
Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not account sin.
Does this blessedness then come upon the circumcised only, or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.
How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those believing through uncircumcision, that righteousness might be accounted to them also;
and the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham while still uncircumcised.
For the promise that he would be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith.
For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been annulled,
because the Law brings about wrath; for where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all
(as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations) in the presence of Him whom he believed; God, who makes the dead alive and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;
who, against hope, believed in hope, so that he might become the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, So shall your seed be.
And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;
he did not hesitate at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,
and being fully assured that what He had promised He is also able to perform.
And therefore it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was accounted to him,
but also for us, to whom it shall be accounted, believing in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,
who was delivered up because of our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice on the hope of the glory of God.
And not only that, but we also exult in afflictions, knowing that affliction produces perseverance;
and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.
And hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some would even be bold enough to die.
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to every person, because everyone sinned.
For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not accounted when there is no law.
Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.
But the free gift is not like the offense. For if by the one man’s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.
And the gift is not like it was through the one who sinned. For the judgment from one offense was unto condemnation, but the free gift from many offenses is unto justification.
For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who are receiving abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.
Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment was to every person unto condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift is to every person unto justification of life.
For as through one man’s disobedience many were declared sinners, so also through one Man’s obedience many will be declared righteous.
Moreover the Law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more,
so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
Let it not be! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
Or do you not know that as many of us as were immersed into Christ Jesus were immersed into His death?
Therefore we were buried with Him through immersion into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in resurrection,
knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be nullified, that we should no longer serve sin.
For he who has died has been justified from sin.
Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,
knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.
For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives unto God.
Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.
And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under Law but under grace.
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under Law but under grace? Let it not be!
Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you.
And having been set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.
For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the Law), that the Law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?
For the woman who has a husband is bound by the Law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband.
So then if, while her husband lives, she becomes another man’s, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she becomes another man’s.
Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you may become Another’s; to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit unto God.
For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sin which were through the Law were at work in our members to bear fruit unto death.
But now we have been loosed from the Law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.
What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Let it not be! On the contrary, I would not have understood sin except through the Law. For I would not have known lust unless the Law had said, You shall not covet.
But sin, taking occasion through the commandment, produced in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.
I was alive once apart from the Law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.
And the commandment, which was unto life, I found to be unto death.
For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.
Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.
Has then that which is good become death to me? Let it not be! But sin, that it might appear to be sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.
For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.
For what I am doing, I do not understand. For what I do not wish to do, that I do; moreover, what I hate, that I do.
If, then, I do what I do not wish to do, I agree with the Law that it is good.
But now, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to desire is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find.
For the good that I wish to do, I do not do; but the evil I do not wish to do, that I practice.
Now if I do what I do not wish to do, it is no longer I doing it, but sin that dwells in me.
I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one desiring to do good.
For I delight in the Law of God according to the inward man.
But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?
I thank God; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh; and on account of sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,
that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, nor indeed can be.
So then, those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.
But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.
And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through His Spirit who dwells in you.
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors; not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
For you did not receive a spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, Abba, Father.
The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
and if children, then heirs; heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed unto us.
For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.
For the creation was subjected to vanity, not willingly, but through Him who subjected it in hope;
because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation groans and travails together until now.
Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.
For we were saved by hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees?
But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to God.
And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.
For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.
Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.
What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.
Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, but rather is also raised, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
Yet in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loves us.
For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,
that I have great sorrow and continual grief in my heart.
For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ on behalf of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
who are Israelites, to whom pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the service of God, and the promises;
of whom are the fathers and from whom, according to the flesh, is Christ, being God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
Moreover, it is not as though the Word of God has fallen away. For not all those of Israel are Israel,
nor are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but, In Isaac your Seed shall be called.
That is, those who are the children of flesh, these are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are accounted as seed.
For this is the Word of promise: At this time I will come and Sarah shall have a son.
And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one man, even by our father Isaac
(for the children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who calls),
it was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.
As it is written, Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.
What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Let it not be!
For He says to Moses, I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.
So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared in all the earth.
Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.
You will say to me then, Why does He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?
No, rather, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why have you made me like this?
Does not the potter have authority over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?
What if God, determining to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath rendered fit unto destruction,
and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand unto glory,
whom He also called, not only of us Jews, but also of the Gentiles?
As He says also in Hosea: I will call them My people, who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
And it shall come to pass in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, There they shall be called, Sons of the living God.
Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant will be saved.
For He is fulfilling the Word and executing it quickly in righteousness, because the Lord will quickly execute the Word upon the earth.
And as Isaiah said before: Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have taken hold of righteousness, even the righteousness of faith;
but Israel, pursuing the Law of righteousness, has not arrived at the Law of righteousness.
Why? Because it was not by faith, but as out of works of the Law. For they stumbled at the stumbling stone.
As it is written: Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense, and everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame.
Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is for them to be saved.
For I bear witness of them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to full true knowledge.
For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God.
For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the Law, The man who does those things shall live by them.
But the righteousness of faith speaks in this manner, Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into Heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down)
or, Who will descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
But what does it say? The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that is, the Word of Faith which we preach):
that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
For the Scripture says, Everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame.
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich toward all who call upon Him.
For everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
How then shall they call on Him into whom they do not believe? And how shall they believe Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without preaching?
And how shall they preach if they are not sent? As it is written: How beautiful are the feet of those preaching the gospel of peace, bringing glad tidings of good things.
But they have not all obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah says, Lord, who believes our report?
So then faith is of hearing, and hearing through the Word of God.
But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed: Their sound has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation, I will move you to anger by a foolish nation.
But Isaiah is very bold and says: I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those not inquiring after Me.
But to Israel he says: All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contradicting people.
I say then, has God cast away His people? Let it not be! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,
Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.
But what does the Divine response say to him? I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace no longer becomes grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.
What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
Just as it is written: God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.
And David says: Let their table become a snare and a trap, and a stumbling block and a recompense to them.
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see, and bow down their back always.
I say then, have they stumbled that they should come to an end? Let it not be! But through their trespass, to provoke them to jealousy, salvation has come to the Gentiles.
Now if their trespass is riches for the world; and their diminishing, riches for the Gentiles; how much more their fullness.
For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh and save some of them.
For if their being cast away is the reconciling of the world, what will their reception be but life from the dead?
For if the firstfruit is holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree,
do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
You will say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.
Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be highminded, but fear.
For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either.
Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: On those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.
And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree.
For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, that you not be wise within yourselves, that hardness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles comes in.
And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;
for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.
Indeed, concerning the gospel they are enemies because of you, but concerning the election they are beloved because of the fathers.
For the gifts and the calling of God are without regret.
For as you were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience,
even so these also have now been disobedient, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
For God has enclosed everyone in disobedience, that He might have mercy on each one.
Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!
For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor?
Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?
For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.
For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to understand with a sound mind, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.
For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,
so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.
But having different gifts according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, according to the proportion of faith;
or ministry, in ministering; he who teaches, in teaching;
he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with simplicity; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cleave to what is good.
Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, leading the way before one another in honor;
not slothful in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;
rejoicing in hope, patient in affliction, continuing steadfastly in prayer;
distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality.
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own opinion.
Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men.
If it is possible, as for yourself, be at peace with all men.
Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.
Therefore if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
Let every soul be subject to the higher authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are ordained by God.
Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will receive judgment on themselves.
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.
For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil.
Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.
For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing.
Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.
Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the Law.
For: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not covet; and if there is any other commandment, all are summed up in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
Love does no evil to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the Law.
And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
Let us walk decently, as in the day, not in carousings and drunkenness, not in cohabitation and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.
Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful thoughts.
For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables.
Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him.
Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.
One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.
He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.
For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.
For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s.
For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord over both the dead and the living.
But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you treat your brother as being of no account? For everyone shall appear before the judgment seat of Christ.
For it is written: As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
So then each of us shall give account concerning himself to God.
Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a snare in our brother’s way.
I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died.
Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;
for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.
Therefore let us pursue the things of peace and the things that build up one another.
Do not bring to naught the work of God on account of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man whose eating causes a stumbling block.
It is good not to eat flesh nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is enticed to sin or is made weak.
Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Blessed is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it is not out of faith; for whatever is not out of faith is sin.
We then who are strong ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to building up.
For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.
For whatever things were written before were written for our instruction, that we through the patience and encouragement of the Scriptures might have hope.
Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be of the same mind toward one another, according to Christ Jesus,
that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.
Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises unto the fathers,
and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, and sing unto Your name.
And again he says: Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.
And again: Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles. Praise Him, all you peoples.
And again, Isaiah says: There shall be a root of Jesse; and He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope.
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God,
that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Therefore I have reason to exult in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.
For I will not dare to speak of anything which Christ has not accomplished through me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles in word and deed;
in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fulfilled the preaching of the gospel of Christ.
And so I have striven to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, so that I should not build on another man’s foundation,
but as it is written: To whom He was not announced, they shall see; and those who have not heard shall understand.
For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you.
But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,
whenever I may journey to Spain, I shall come to you; for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may be filled with your company briefly.
But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.
For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make certain gifts for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.
For it seemed good to them, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, it is also their duty to minister to them in carnal things.
Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go through you to Spain.
But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
Now I exhort you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,
that I may be delivered from those in Judea who are disobedient, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
that I may come to you with joy through the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
I commend to you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church in Cenchrea,
that you may receive her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her in whatever business she has need of you; for indeed she has been a helper of many and of myself also.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.
Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.
Greet Mary, who labored much for us.
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
Greet Apelles, approved in Christ. Greet those of Aristobulus.
Greet Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those who are of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, who have labored in the Lord. Greet the beloved Persis, who labored much in the Lord.
Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.
Now I exhort you, brethren, note those who cause divisions and snares, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and turn away from them.
For those who are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple.
For your obedience has reached to everyone. Therefore I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise unto what is good, and simple toward evil.
And the God of peace will trample Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Timothy, my fellow worker, and Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, greet you.
I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, greet you in the Lord.
Gaius, my host and the host of the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, greets you, and Quartus, a brother.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept silent since the world began,
but now has been made manifest, and by the prophetic Scriptures has been made known to all nations, according to the commandment of the eternal God, for obedience to the faith;
to God, alone wise, be glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
Paul, appointed an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,
that you were enriched in everything in Him in all utterance and all knowledge,
even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,
so that you are not lacking in any gift, patiently waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who will also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Now I exhort you, brethren, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be completely fitted together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of Chloe’s household, that there are contentions among you.
Now I say this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you immersed into the name of Paul?
I thank God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
that no one should say that I had immersed into my name.
Yes, I also immersed the household of Stephanas. Besides that, I do not know whether I immersed any others.
For Christ did not send me to immerse, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect.
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the intelligent.
Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who are believing.
For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;
but we preach Christ crucified, truly to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,
but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
For you see your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many of nobility.
But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are mighty;
and the low-born of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,
that no flesh should boast in His presence.
But out of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who was made for us from God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;
that, as it is written, He who exults, let him exult in the Lord.
And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the Testimony of God.
For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.
And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in proof of the Spirit and of power,
that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature; but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, having been hidden, which God appointed before the ages for our glory,
which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written: Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it dawned upon the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.
But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.
For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God.
These things we also speak, not in words which human wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But he who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no one.
For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.
I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able, and even now you are still not able;
for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like men?
For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal?
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believe, as the Lord gave to each one?
I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow.
So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who causes growth.
Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.
For no one is able to lay any other foundation than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,
each one’s work will be revealed; for the Day will declare it, because it will be disclosed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.
If anyone’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.
If anyone’s work is consumed, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He catches the wise in their own craftiness;
and again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come; all are yours.
And you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.
Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.
But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human day in court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
For I know nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one’s praise will be from God.
Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up one over the other.
For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
You are already full. You are already rich. You have reigned as kings without us; and indeed I wish you truly did reign, that we also might reign with you.
For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we became spectacles to all creation, both to angels and to men.
We are foolish because of Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are distinguished, but we are dishonored.
To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and wander homeless.
And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;
being defamed, we entreat. We have become as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.
I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you.
For though you might have countless instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.
For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.
Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.
For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power.
What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?
Everywhere it is heard that there is sexual perversion among you, and such sexual perversion as is not even named among the Gentiles; that a man has his father’s wife.
And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who has done this deed might be removed out from among your midst.
For indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, I have already judged him who has so done this deed, as though I were present.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I wrote to you in my epistle not to keep company with sexually immoral people.
Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.
But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; not even to eat with such a person.
For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?
But those who are outside God judges. Therefore put away from among yourselves the evil person.
Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
Do you not know that we shall judge angels? To say nothing of things that pertain to this life?
If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge.
I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren?
But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers.
Now therefore, it is already an utter failure with you that you go to court against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather be defrauded?
No, you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and these things to brethren.
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray. Neither prostitutes, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,
nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.
And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be enslaved under the power of any.
Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual perversion but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up through His power.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot? Let it not be!
Or do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For the two, He says, shall become one flesh.
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
Flee sexual perversion. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.
Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
Nevertheless, because of sexual perversion, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.
Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.
The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
Do not deprive one another except by agreement for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
But I say this by permission, not by commandment.
For I wish that all men were even as myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.
But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;
but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be on fire.
Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to leave her husband.
But, indeed, if she is separated, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to send away his wife.
But to the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is willing to live with him, let him not send her away.
And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, if he is willing to live with her, let her not leave him.
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
But if the unbeliever leaves, let them leave; a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us in peace.
For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.
Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.
Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you are able to be made free, rather use it.
For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called while free is Christ’s slave.
You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.
Brethren, let each one remain with God however he was called.
Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one who, having received mercy from the Lord, is faithful.
I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present necessity; that it is good for a man to be thus:
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
But also if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I am sparing you.
But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that even those who have wives should be as though they had none,
those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,
and those who use this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.
But I want you to be free from anxiety. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord; how to please the Lord.
But he who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please his wife.
There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world; how to please her husband.
And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.
But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and it is the duty, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let him marry.
Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has control over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep himself a virgin, does well.
So then he who gives in marriage does well, but he who does not give in marriage does better.
A wife is bound by Law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
But she is happier if she remains so, according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.
Now concerning sacrifices to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.
Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one.
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in the heavens or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him.
However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat do we excel, nor if we do not eat are we lacking.
But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol’s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat things offered to idols?
And because of your knowledge the weak brother will perish, the one for whom Christ died.
But when you sin in this way against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh, so that I not make my brother stumble.
Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
If I am not an apostle to others, yet at least I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
My defense to those who examine me is this:
Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?
Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no authority to not work?
Who ever serves military duty at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk of the flock?
Do I say these things only as a man? Or does not the Law say the same also?
For it is written in the Law of Moses, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain. Is it oxen God is concerned about?
Or does He say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.
If we have sown spiritual things to you, is it a great thing if we reap your material things?
If others are partakers of this authority over you, should we not even more? Nevertheless we have not used this authority, but endure all things so that we might not hinder the gospel of Christ.
Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the altar?
Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel.
But I have used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should be done so with me; for it would be better for me to die than that anyone should make my exulting void.
For if I preach the gospel, there is no glory to me, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.
For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
What is my reward then? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel.
For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more;
and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain those who are under the Law;
to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under the Law toward Christ), that I might gain those who are without law;
to the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might in any way save some.
Now this I do through the gospel, that I may become a fellow partaker of it.
Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
And everyone who competes for the prize controls himself in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we an imperishable.
Therefore I run in this manner: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as one who beats the air.
But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.
Moreover, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
and all were immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
and all ate the same spiritual food,
and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank out of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.
But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness.
Now these things became examples for us, so that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.
Neither become idolaters as were some of them. As it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them prostituted, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell;
nor let us test Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents;
nor murmur, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.
Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.
Therefore let him who thinks he is firmly established take heed that he not fall.
No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also provide a way out, that you may be able to bear it.
Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say.
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ. The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ.
For we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake of that one bread.
Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?
Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons.
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons.
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful; all things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.
Let no one seek his own, but each one the other’s well-being.
Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, not investigating because of conscience;
for the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.
If any of those who do not believe invite you to dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, not questioning because of conscience.
But if anyone says to you, This was offered to idols, do not eat it for the sake of the one who informed you, and because of conscience; for the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.
Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my liberty judged by another’s conscience?
But if I partake by grace, why am I evil spoken of because of that for which I give thanks?
Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
Do not become a cause of stumbling, either to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God,
just as I also strive to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own profit, but of the many, in order that they may be saved.
Be imitators of me, just as I am also of Christ.
Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the decrees just as I delivered them to you.
But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
Every man praying or prophesying, having anything down over his head, dishonors his head.
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaven.
For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
For a man indeed ought not to veil his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man.
Nor was man created through the woman, but woman through the man.
For this reason the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.
Nevertheless, neither is man without the woman, nor woman without the man, in the Lord.
For as woman is out of man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.
Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled?
Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?
But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her in place of a wrap.
But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the churches of God.
Now in this that I command you, I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.
For first of all, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
For there need to also be heresies among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.
Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper.
For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk.
What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.
For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;
and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, Take, eat; this is My body which is broken on behalf of you; do this in remembrance of Me.
In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Covenant in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.
For as often as you may eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.
Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not making a distinction regarding the Lord’s body.
For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many have been put to death.
For if we would discern ourselves, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.
Now concerning spiritual matters, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant:
You know that you were Gentiles, led away regarding these mute idols, in whatever manner you were led.
Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.
There are different distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.
And there are different distributions of ministries, but the same Lord.
And there are different distributions of works, but it is the same God who works each and every work.
But the manifestation is given through the Spirit to each one for the profit of all:
for to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another a word of knowledge through the same Spirit,
to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the same Spirit,
to another works of power, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another tongues of nationalities, to another the interpretation of tongues.
But the one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.
For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.
For by one Spirit we were all immersed into one body; whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.
For also the body is not one member but many.
If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?
But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He intended.
And if they were all one member, where would the body be?
But now indeed there are many members, but yet one body.
And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, we clothe them with greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have abundant elegance,
but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given more abundant honor to that part which is lacking,
that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
And God has placed some in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, governings, tongues of nationalities.
Not everyone is an apostle are they? Not everyone is a prophet? Not everyone is a teacher? Not everyone is a worker of power?
Not everyone has gifts of healing? Not everyone speaks with tongues? Not everyone interprets?
But earnestly desire the more useful gifts. And yet I show you a way according to excellence.
If I were to speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become as sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.
And if I were to have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I were to have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
And if I were to bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I were to give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.
Love is longsuffering and is kind; love does not envy; love does not boast itself, is not puffed up;
does not behave indecently, does not seek its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;
does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
covers all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will come to an end; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will come to an end.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part.
But when the complete whole comes, then that which is in part will come to an end.
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put an end to childish things.
For now we see through a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall fully know just as I also am fully known.
And now remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
Pursue love, and be zealous over spiritual matters, but rather that you may prophesy.
For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.
But he who prophesies speaks to men for building up and exhortation and comfort.
He who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but he who prophesies builds up the church.
I wish you all spoke with tongues, but rather that you prophesied; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive building up.
But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching?
Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they present different musical notes, how will it be known what is piped or played?
For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who will prepare himself for battle?
So likewise you, if you do not utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.
There are, it may be, so many ethnic languages in the world, and none of them is without its own speech.
Therefore, if I do not know the dynamics of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks will be a foreigner to me.
Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual matters, seek to excel in the building up of the church.
Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.
Otherwise, if you praise in the spirit, how will he who occupies the place set apart for the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?
For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not built up.
I thank my God I speak with tongues more than every one of you;
yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
Brethren, do not be children in understanding; however, in malice be infants, but in understanding be mature.
In the Law it is written: With men of other languages and other lips I will speak to this people; And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me, says the Lord.
Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.
Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and everyone speaks in tongues, and there come in those who are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are not in your right minds?
But if everyone prophesies, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all.
And thus the secrets of his heart become revealed; and so, falling down on his face, he will do homage to God and proclaim that God is truly among you.
How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.
But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.
Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.
But if anything is revealed to another who sits by, let the first keep silent.
For you can each prophesy one by one, that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
For God is not of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.
Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be in subjection, as the Law also says.
And if they desire to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.
Or did the Word of God go forth from you? Or did it come only to you?
If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.
Let all things be done decently and in order.
Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand,
by which also you are being kept safe, if you hold fast that Word which I preached to you; unless you believe in vain.
For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day according to the Scriptures,
and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.
After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until the present time, but some have fallen asleep.
After that He was seen by Jacob, then by each of the apostles.
Then last of all He was seen by me also, as by one of untimely birth.
For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than every one of them, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believe.
Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith is also vain.
Yes, and we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up; if in fact the dead are not raised.
For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.
Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.
But now Christ has been raised from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
For since through man came death, through Man also came the resurrection of the dead.
For as in Adam everyone dies, even so in Christ everyone shall be made alive.
But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His coming.
Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.
For it is necessary for Him to reign till He has put every enemy under His feet.
The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.
For He has subjected everything under His feet. But when He says everything is subjected, it is evident that He who subjected everything under Him is exempt.
Now when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to Him who subjected everything under Him, that God may be everything in all things.
Otherwise, what will they do who are immersed for the dead, if the dead are not truly raised? Why then are they immersed for the dead?
And why are we in danger every hour?
I affirm, by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die throughout the day.
If like other men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what profit is it to me, if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!
Do not be led astray: Evil company corrupts good character.
Awake to righteousness, and do not sin; for some do not have the knowledge of God. I speak to your shame.
But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?
Foolish one, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.
And what you sow, you do not sow the body that shall be, but mere grain; perhaps wheat or something else.
But God gives it a body as He purposed, and to each seed its own body.
Not every flesh is the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.
There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the brightness of the heavenly is one, and the brightness of the earthly is another.
There is one brightness of the sun, another brightness of the moon, and another brightness of the stars; for one star differs from another star in brightness.
So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.
It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
And so it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a life-giving Spirit.
However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, and afterward the spiritual.
The first man was out of the earth, of dust; the second Man is the Lord out of Heaven.
As is the man of dust, so also are those of dust; and as is the Man from Heaven, so also are those of Heaven.
And as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the Man of Heaven.
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption.
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed;
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this corruptible needs to put on incorruption, and this mortal needs to put on immortality.
So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.
O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?
The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also you do:
On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up from whatever he is prospered, that there be no collections when I come.
And when I come, whomever you approve through letters I will send to carry your good will to Jerusalem.
But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.
Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia).
And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me forward wherever I may go.
For I do not desire to see you now in passing; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.
But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost.
For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many opposing.
Now if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his way in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.
Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but it was not at all his desire to come at this time; however, he will come when he has opportunity.
Watch, stand fast in the faith, be like men, be strong.
Let all that you do be done with love.
I encourage you, brethren; you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have appointed themselves to the ministry of the saints;
that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us.
I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied.
For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.
The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
The salutation with my own hand, Paul.
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. The Lord comes.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,
who encourages us in all our affliction, that we may be able to encourage those who are in any affliction, through the comfort by which we ourselves are encouraged by God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our comfort also abounds through Christ.
Now if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation, being effective in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are encouraged, it is for your comfort and salvation.
And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the comfort.
For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened exceedingly, beyond strength, so that we despaired even of life.
Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,
who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us, in whom we hope that He will still deliver us,
you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given through many persons on our behalf for the gracious gift granted to us by many.
For our rejoicing is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, and more abundantly toward you.
For we are not writing any other things to you than what you read or understand. And I hope you will understand, even to the end
(as also you have understood us in part), that we are your rejoicing as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.
And in this confidence I intended to come to you before now, that you might have a second benefit;
to journey on through you to Macedonia, to come again from Macedonia to you, and be sent by you on towards Judea.
Therefore, when I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I plan, do I plan according to the flesh, that with me there should be Yes, Yes, and No, No?
But as God is faithful, our word to you was not Yes and No.
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us; through me, Silvanus, and Timothy; was not Yes and No, but in Him was Yes.
For as many promises as are of God, in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, unto the glory of God through us.
Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and has anointed us is God,
who also has sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
Moreover I call God as witness against my soul, that to spare you I came no more to Corinth.
Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers of your joy; for by faith you stand.
But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.
For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?
And I wrote this very thing to you, that, when I came, I should not have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you should be sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly for you.
But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part; that I may not be overbearing on everyone.
This punishment from the majority is sufficient for such a man,
so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and encourage him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow.
Therefore I encourage you to confirm your love to him.
For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.
Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one through you in the person of Christ,
so that Satan should not take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his purposes.
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,
I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.
Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us manifests the aroma of His knowledge in every place.
For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things?
For we are not, as so many, peddling the Word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ, in the sight of God.
Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some others, letters of commendation to you or commendation from you?
You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read by all men.
Clearly you are a letter of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but in tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart.
And we have such confidence through Christ toward God.
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being out of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,
who also made us able ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.
But if the ministry of death, written and engraved in stone, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, which was passing away,
how much will not the ministry of the Spirit be more glorious.
For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, even more the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory.
For even what was made glorious had no glory in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.
For if what is passing away was glorious, much more what remains is glorious.
Therefore, since we have such hope, we use much boldness;
not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel could not look steadily at the end of what was passing away.
But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Covenant, which is being done away in Christ.
But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.
Nevertheless when one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.
Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not faint.
But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience before God.
But also if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,
whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, so that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.
For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus’ sake.
For it is God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not from us.
We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;
persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
For we who live are always delivered to death because of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
So then death is working in us, but life in you.
And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I believe and therefore I speak, we also believe and therefore speak,
knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up through Jesus, and will present us with you.
For all things are for you, that the grace may excel through the greater numbers, and cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.
Therefore we do not faint. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is achieving for us a surpassing and eternal weight of glory,
while we do not contemplate the things which are seen, but the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in Heaven.
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our dwelling place out of Heaven,
if indeed, being clothed, we shall not be found naked.
For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life.
Now He who has fashioned us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the earnest of the Spirit.
So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord.
For we walk by faith, not by sight.
We are confident, yes, preferring rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
Therefore we strive, whether at home or away, to be well pleasing to Him.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.
Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are well known to God, and I also hope are well known in your consciences.
For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to rejoice on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.
For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.
For the love of Christ holds us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died;
and He died for all, that those who live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them and rose again.
Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.
Now all things are from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,
that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the Word of reconciliation.
Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. As God is exhorting through us, we beseech you on Christ’s behalf, Be reconciled to God.
For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
We then, as workers together with Him, also beseech you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
For He says: In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
Giving no cause of stumbling in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed.
But in all things commending ourselves as ministers of God; in much endurance, in afflictions, in needs, in distresses,
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings,
in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
in the Word of Truth, in the power of God, through the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
through honor and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not put to death;
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
O Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is wide open.
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be wide open.
Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?
And what agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever?
And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
Therefore, Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you.
And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.
I do not say this to condemn; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my rejoicing on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.
For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were troubled on every side. Outside were fightings, inside were fears.
Nevertheless God, who encourages the downcast, encouraged us by the coming of Titus,
and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was encouraged in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.
For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the letter made you sorry, even if for a while.
Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry unto repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing.
For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.
For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vengeance! In all things you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
Therefore, although I wrote to you, I did not do it for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.
Therefore we have been encouraged in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
For if in anything I have exulted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our exulting to Titus was found true.
And his affections are greater for you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.
Therefore I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.
Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:
that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality.
For I bear witness that according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,
imploring us with much entreating that we would receive the gift and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
And not only as we had hoped, but they first gave themselves to the Lord, and also to us through the will of God.
So we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace among you as well.
But as you abound in everything (in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us), see that you abound in this grace also.
I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love through the diligence of others.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.
And in this I give advice: It is profitable for you not only to be doing what you began and were intending to do a year ago;
but now you also must complete the doing of it; that as there was an eagerness to purpose it, so there also may be a completion out of what you have.
For if something is presented eagerly, it is accepted according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have.
For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;
but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack; that there may be equality.
As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.
But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
For indeed he accepted the exhortation, and being more earnest, he went to you of his own accord.
And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,
and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself, and your ready mind,
avoiding this: that anyone should find fault with us in this abundance which is administered by us;
providing honorable things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.
And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which we have in you.
If anyone inquires about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you; or our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our exulting on your behalf.
Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you;
for I know your willingness, about which I exult of you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has stirred up the majority.
Yet I have sent the brethren, that our exulting of you should not be in vain in this respect, that, as I said, you may be ready;
lest if some Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed in this confident exulting.
Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to go to you ahead of time, and prepare your bounty beforehand, which you had previously announced, that it may be ready as a blessing and not as greed.
But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not from sorrow or out of duty; for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound for every good work.
As it is written: He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.
Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for eating, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness,
while you are enriched in everything unto all sincerity, which causes thanksgiving through us to God.
For the ministry of this service not only supplies what is lacking to the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,
through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for your professed obedience to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men,
and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.
Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift.
Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and fairness of Christ; who in presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.
But I beseech you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence by which I figure on being bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God for pulling down strongholds,
casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity unto the obedience of Christ,
and being ready to avenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled.
Do you look at things according to the outward appearance? If anyone is convinced in himself that he is Christ’s, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ’s, even so we are Christ’s.
For even if I should boast somewhat more about our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed;
so that I may not seem to frighten you by letters.
For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.
Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word through letters when we are absent, such we are also in deed when we are present.
For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with those who commend themselves. But they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God distributed to us; a measure which reaches even unto you.
For we are not overextending ourselves (as though not extending to you), for we also came as far as to you with the gospel of Christ;
not boasting of things beyond measure, that is, in other men’s labors, but having hope, that as your faith is growing, according to our rule, being greatly enlarged to overflowing,
in order to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another’s measure of accomplishment.
But he who glories, let him glory in the Lord.
For not he who commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
Oh, that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, and indeed bear with me.
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.
But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted; you may well put up with it.
For I consider that I am not at all inferior to the most eminent apostles.
Even though I am unskilled in speech, yet not in knowledge; but have been fully exposed to you in all things.
Did I commit sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you freely?
I robbed other churches, taking wages from them to minister to you.
And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked, the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied. And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself.
As the truth of Christ is in me, no one shall stop me from this exulting in the regions of Achaia.
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows.
But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the things of which they boast.
For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.
And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.
I say again, let no one think me to be foolish. Otherwise if not, at least receive me as being foolish, that I also may boast a little.
What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
Seeing that many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.
For you put up with fools gladly, since you are wise.
For you endure if someone brings you into bondage, if someone devours you, if someone takes from you, if someone exalts himself, if someone strikes you on the face.
I speak in dishonor, as though we had been weak. But in whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.
Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I excel them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often.
From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.
Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep;
in journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
in hardship and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness;
besides the other things, that come upon me daily: the care of each of the churches.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?
If I must boast, I will boast of the things of my infirmity.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, intending to arrest me;
but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.
It is really not profitable for me to boast, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows); such a one was caught up to the third Heaven.
And I know such a man (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows);
how he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
Of such a one I will exult; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities.
For though I might desire to boast, I will not be foolish, for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, that no one should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me.
And so that I should not be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me, that I should not be made haughty.
Concerning this thing I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me.
And He said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Therefore most gladly I will rather exult in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
I have become foolish in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing.
Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong.
Now the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.
But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning.
Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?
I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?
Again, do you think that we defend ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.
For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, evil speakings, whisperings, conceits, commotions;
that it not be, when I come again, that my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, sexual perversities, and licentiousness which they have practiced.
This will be the third time I am coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
I have told you before, and foretell as if I were present the second time, and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare;
since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.
For though He was crucified out of weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know, yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you; unless indeed you are ones failing the test?
But I hope that you will know that we are not ones failing the test.
Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we should appear acceptable, but that you should do what is honorable, even though we may seem to be unacceptable.
For we have no power against the truth, but on behalf of truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.
Therefore I write these things being absent, that when present I should not use sharpness, according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for pulling down.
Finally, brethren, rejoice. Become complete. Be encouraged, be of one mind, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss.
All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),
and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you into the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,
which is not another; but there are some who trouble you, even determined to pervert the gospel of Christ.
But even if we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.
As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.
For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.
But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.
And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,
to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to inquire of Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.
But I saw none of the other apostles except Jacob, the Lord’s brother.
(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)
Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ.
But they were hearing only, He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.
And they glorified God in me.
Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with me.
And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain.
Yet not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
And this occurred because of false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage),
to whom we did not yield in submission even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
But those who seemed to be something (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows personal regard to no man), those who seemed to be important added nothing to me.
But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised had been committed to me, as the gospel for the circumcised was to Peter
(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles),
and when Jacob, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
They desired only that we should remember the poor, the very thing which I also was eager to do.
Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed;
for before certain men came from Jacob, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.
But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to Judaize?
We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through the faith of Jesus Christ, even we believe into Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the Law; for by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified.
But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found to be sinners, is Christ therefore a minister of sin? Let it not be.
For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I confirm myself as a transgressor.
For I through the Law died to the Law that I might live to God.
I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.
I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died in vain.
O foolish Galatians. Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?
This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?
Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, do you now perfect yourselves in the flesh?
Have you suffered so many things in vain; if indeed it was in vain?
Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and displays works of power in you, does He do it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?
Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Therefore know that those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel before to Abraham, saying, In you all the nations shall be blessed.
So then those who are of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
For as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them.
But that no one is justified by the Law in the sight of God is evident; for, The just shall live by faith.
Yet the Law is not of faith; but, The man who does them shall live in them.
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree),
that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Brethren, I speak in the manner of men: Though it is only a man’s covenant, yet if it is confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.
Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to your Seed, who is Christ.
And this I say, A covenant having been established before by God in Christ, the Law coming into being four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the promise, so as to abolish it.
For if the inheritance is of the Law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
What purpose then does the Law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hand of a mediator.
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
Is the Law then against the promises of God? Let it not be. For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been out of the Law.
But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to those believing.
But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the Law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed.
Therefore the Law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,
but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.
Even so we, when we were children, were enslaved under the elements of the world.
But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, brought forth out of a woman, brought forth under the Law,
to redeem those who were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, Abba, Father!
Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
However, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods.
But now, knowing God, or rather being known by God, how is it that you turn again to the feeble and worthless principles, to which you desire again to be in bondage?
You observe days and months and seasons and years.
I am afraid for you, lest I have labored among you in vain.
Brethren, I beseech you to be as I am, for I am as you are. You have not wronged me at all.
You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first.
And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
What then was the blessing you enjoyed? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me.
Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
They zealously pursue you, but not well; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them.
But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.
My little children, for whom I travail again until Christ is formed in you,
I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.
Tell me, you who desire to be under the Law, do you not hear the Law?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman.
But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through promise,
which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar;
for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children;
but the Jerusalem from above is free, which is the mother of us all.
For it is written: Rejoice, O barren, you who do not bear. Break forth and shout, you who are not in labor. For the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.
Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.
But, as he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.
Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.
Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.
Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.
And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole Law.
You have become cut off from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by Law; you have fallen from grace.
For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness out of faith.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.
You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.
A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.
And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased.
I could wish that those who unsettle your minds would even cut themselves off.
For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another.
I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.
Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, sexual perversion, uncleanness, licentiousness,
idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies,
envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,
meekness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering yourself that you not also be tempted.
Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.
For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each one prove his own work, and then he alone will have rejoicing in himself, and not in another.
For each one shall bear his own load.
Let him being taught the Word share in all good things with him who teaches.
Do not be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.
And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due time we shall reap if we do not faint.
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
For not even those who are circumcised keep the Law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any power, but a new creation.
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brand marks of the Lord Jesus.
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ,
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love,
having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved.
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of His grace
which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding,
having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself,
that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might sum up in one all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven and which are on earth; in Him.
In Him also we have been assigned to an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will,
that we who previously trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.
In whom also, after you heard the Word of Truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also, believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,
who is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers:
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full true knowledge of Him,
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us, who believe according to the working of His mighty power
which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,
far above all rule and authority and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come.
And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all things in all.
And you being dead in trespasses and sins,
in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,
among whom also we all formerly conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others;
but God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,
even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you are saved),
and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,
that in the ages to come He might display the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace you are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;
not of works, that no one should boast.
For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
Therefore remember that you, being Gentiles in the flesh; who are called uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision made in the flesh by hands;
that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been made near by the blood of Christ.
For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation,
having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, that He might create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace,
and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity.
And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near.
For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,
having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone,
in whom the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord,
in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.
For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles;
if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you,
how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already,
by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ),
which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:
that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and joint partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,
of which I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.
To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ;
to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies,
according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through His faith.
Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my afflictions on your behalf, which is your glory.
For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of whom the whole family in Heaven and earth is named,
that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,
that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be able to grasp with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height;
to know the surpassing knowledge and love of Christ; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
to Him be glory in the church in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,
with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,
endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling;
one Lord, one faith, one immersion;
one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.
But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Therefore He says: When He ascended on high, He led captive the captives, and gave gifts to men.
(Now this, He ascended; what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?
He who descended is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)
And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,
for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,
till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the full true knowledge of the Son of God, to a complete man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,
but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head, Christ,
from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every individual does its part, causes growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.
This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the emptiness of their mind,
having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;
who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to licentiousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
But you have not so learned Christ,
if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus:
that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which is corrupted according to the deceitful lusts,
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.
Therefore, putting away lying, let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.
Be angry, but do not sin: do not let the sun go down on your wrath,
nor give place to the devil.
Let him who stole steal no longer, but rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.
Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for the business of building up, that it may impart grace to the hearers.
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all wickedness.
And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you.
Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children.
And walk in love, as Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.
But sexual perversion and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints;
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
For this you know, that no prostitute, unclean person, nor covetous person, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let no one beguile you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
Therefore do not be partakers with them.
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light
(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),
proving what is acceptable to the Lord.
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret.
But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light.
Therefore He says: Awake, you who sleep, stand forth out from among the dead, and Christ will shine on you.
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise,
redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled by the Spirit,
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
submitting to one another in the fear of God.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.
Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,
that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the Word,
that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.
So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself.
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church.
For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.
For this, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.
This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she reverence her husband.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with promise:
that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.
And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.
Bondservants, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ;
not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men,
knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.
And you, masters, do the same things to them, giving up threatening, knowing that your own Master also is in Heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.
Put on all the armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities, against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies.
Therefore take up all the armor of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Stand firm therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God;
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints;
and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel,
for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
But that you also may know my affairs and how I am doing, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make all things known to you,
whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know our affairs, and that he may encourage your hearts.
Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and ministers:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,
being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it unto the day of Jesus Christ;
just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of the grace.
For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affections of Jesus Christ.
And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in full true knowledge and all discernment,
that you may examine the things that differ, that you may be sincere and without blame unto the day of Christ,
being filled with the fruits of righteousness through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel,
so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ;
and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the Word without fear.
Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will:
The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds;
but the others out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.
For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I do not know.
For I am hard pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you.
And being persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,
that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.
Only, let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,
having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,
fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or self-glory, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others as surpassing himself.
Let each of you not look out for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,
who, being in the form of God, did not consider clinging, to be equal with God,
but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.
And being found comprised as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in Heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your salvation with fear and trembling;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.
Do all things without murmuring and disputing,
that you may be blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
holding fast the Word of Life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.
Yes, and if I am being poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
For the same cause you also be glad and rejoice with me.
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state.
For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state.
For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus.
But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.
Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me.
But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.
Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and your messenger and the one who ministered to my need;
since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow.
Therefore I send him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in honor;
because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.
Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious, but for you it is safe.
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision!
For we are the circumcision, who serve God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in the flesh,
though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I more so:
circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the Law, a Pharisee;
concerning zeal, persecuting the church; concerning the righteousness which is in the Law, blameless.
But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss because of Christ.
But no, rather, I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as refuse, that I may gain Christ
and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith;
that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold, since Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.
Brethren, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and stretching forward to those things which are ahead,
I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
Therefore let us, as many as are complete, be of this mind; and if in anything you think differently, God will reveal even this to you.
Nevertheless, to the degree that we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us be of the same mind.
Brethren, join in being imitators of me, and note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern.
For many conduct themselves, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:
whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and who glory in their shame; who set their mind on earthly things.
For our citizenship is in Heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.
Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, beloved.
I implore Euodia and I implore Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord.
And I urge you also, true yoke-fellow, help these women who labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I say, rejoice!
Let your fairness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;
and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy; think on these things.
The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, do these, and the God of peace will be with you.
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last your care for me has flourished again, though you surely did care, but you lacked opportunity.
Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.
I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in everything I am taught both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack.
I have strength for all things in Christ who strengthens me.
Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my distress.
Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only.
For even in Thessalonica you sent aid once and again for my necessities.
Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that abounds to your account.
Indeed I have all and abound. I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.
And my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar’s household.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of your love for all the saints;
because of the hope being laid up for you in Heaven, of which you heard before in the Word of the Truth of the gospel,
which has come to you, as in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as it is also among you, since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth;
even as you also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ for you,
who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.
For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the full true knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, bearing fruit in every good work and growing into the full true knowledge of God;
strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy;
giving thanks to the Father who has made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;
who has delivered us from the authority of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love,
in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
For by Him all things were created that are in Heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.
And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.
And He is the Head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn out from the dead, that in all things He may be preeminent.
For it is good that in Him all the fullness should dwell,
and by Him making peace through the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, whether things on earth or things in the heavens.
And you, who once were alienated and hostile in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled
in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and without blemish, and above reproach in His sight;
if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was preached to every creature under Heaven, of which I, Paul, was made a minister.
I now rejoice in my sufferings on your behalf, and fill up in my flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ, on behalf of His body, which is the church,
of which I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God which was given to me for you, to fulfill the Word of God,
the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.
To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man complete in Christ Jesus.
To this end I also labor, striving according to His working which works in me mightily.
For I want you to know what a great struggle I have for you and those in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,
that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full true knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ,
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Now this I say that no one should delude you with persuasive words.
For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,
being rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
Beware that no one rob you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the traditions of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ.
For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;
and you are made full in Him, who is the Head of all rule and authority.
In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
buried with Him in immersion, in which you also were raised with Him through the faith of the working of God, who raised Him out from the dead.
And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
having blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross;
having disarmed rulers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.
So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,
which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
Let no one condemn you, taking delight in false humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, being puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,
and not holding fast to the Head; from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God.
Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to decrees;
Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle;
which all concern things which perish with the using; according to the commandments and doctrines of men?
These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-devised worship, false humility, and severity in abuse of the body, but are of no value against gratification of the flesh.
If then you are raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.
Set your mind on things above, not on the things of the earth;
for you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ who is our life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.
Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: sexual perversion, uncleanness, passion, evil lusts, and covetousness, which is idolatry.
Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience;
in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them.
But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth.
Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his practices,
and have put on the new man who is renewed in full true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him,
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all things and in all.
Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;
bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.
And above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.
Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, even the Father, through Him.
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter towards them.
Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
Fathers, do not provoke your children, that they may not become discouraged.
Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God.
And whatever you do, do it from the soul, as to the Lord and not to men,
knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.
But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.
Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in Heaven.
Be devoted to prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;
meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the Word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds,
that I may make it clearly understood, as I ought to speak.
Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you everything about me.
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and encourage your hearts,
with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here.
Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),
and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have been a comfort to me.
Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand complete and full-grown in all the will of God;
for I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
Luke the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.
Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.
And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.
This salutation by my own hand: Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,
knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God.
For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, as you know of what sort we were among you for your sake.
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the Word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit,
so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe.
For from you the Word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything.
For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
and to wait for His Son from Heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the coming wrath.
For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was not without fruit.
But even after we had suffered before and were spitefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we were bold in our God to speak the gospel of God to you in much conflict.
For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness, nor was it in deceit.
But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tests our hearts.
For neither at any time did we use flattering words, as you know, nor in pretense of covetousness; God is witness.
Nor did we seek honor from men, either from you or from others, when we might have been authoritative as apostles of Christ.
But we were gentle among you, just as a nurse cherishes her own children.
So, affectionately longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls, because you had become beloved to us.
For you remember, brethren, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.
You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and uprightly and blamelessly we were among you who believe;
as you know how we exhorted, and encouraged, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children,
that you would walk worthily of God who calls you into His kingdom and glory.
For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the Word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the Word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe.
For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans,
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have driven us out; and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the end.
But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored more eagerly, with great desire, to see your face.
Therefore we wanted to come to you; even I, Paul, time and again; but Satan hindered us.
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming.
For you are our glory and joy.
Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we were pleased to be left in Athens alone,
and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,
that no one should be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.
For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we were about to suffer affliction, just as it happened, and you know.
For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also desire to see you;
therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were encouraged concerning you regarding your faith.
For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.
For what thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our God,
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and complete what is lacking in your faith?
Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you,
so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
Finally then, brethren, we urge and exhort in the Lord Jesus that you should abound more and more, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God;
for you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual perversion;
that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,
not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles, who do not know God;
that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified.
For God did not call us to impurity, but in sanctification.
Therefore he who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who has also given us His Holy Spirit.
But concerning brotherly love you have no need that I should write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another;
and indeed you do so toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia. But we urge you, brethren, that you abound more and more;
that you also aspire to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you,
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may have need of nothing.
But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you sorrow not as others who have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.
For this we say to you by the Word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.
For the Lord Himself will descend from Heaven with a shouted command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.
Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together at the same time with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.
Therefore encourage one another with these words.
But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you.
For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.
For when they say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall by no means escape.
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.
You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.
Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober.
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.
But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.
For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who died for us, that whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with Him.
Therefore encourage each other and build up one another, just as you also are doing.
And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the faint-hearted, uphold the weak, be longsuffering towards all.
See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.
Rejoice always,
pray without ceasing,
in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
Do not quench the Spirit.
Do not despise prophecies.
But test all things; hold fast what is good.
Abstain from every form of evil.
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.
Brethren, pray for us.
Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other,
so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and afflictions that you endure,
which is manifest evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer;
since it is righteous judgment with God to repay with affliction those who trouble you,
and to give you who are afflicted rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from Heaven with His mighty angels,
in flaming fire giving full vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,
when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you is believed.
Therefore we also pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His goodness and the work of faith with power,
that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Now brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together to Him, we ask you
not to be quickly disturbed in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the Day of Christ has come.
Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is unveiled, the son of perdition,
who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is honored, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, declaring of himself that he is God.
Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
And now you know what is restraining, that he may be unveiled in his own time.
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He is now restraining, until it is raised from out of the midst.
And then the lawless one will be unveiled, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.
The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,
and with all unrighteous deception among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,
that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
But we owe thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth,
to which He called you through our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, brethren, stand firm and hold on to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort and good hope by grace,
encourage your hearts and establish you in every good word and work.
Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may run freely and be glorified, just as it is with you,
and that we may be delivered from evil and wicked men; for not all have faith.
But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil.
And we are persuaded in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.
Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the teaching which you received from us.
For you yourselves know how you need to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly among you;
nor did we eat anyone’s bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,
not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should imitate us.
For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone does not desire to work, neither shall he eat.
For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies.
Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.
But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good.
And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed.
Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
to Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
As I urged you when I went into Macedonia; remain in Ephesus that you may charge some not to teach other doctrines,
nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith.
Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,
from which some, having deviated, have turned aside to idle talk,
desiring to be teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they strongly assert.
But we know that the Law is good if one uses it lawfully,
knowing this: that the Law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for slayers of fathers and slayers of mothers, for murderers,
for prostitutes, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has given me strength, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,
although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I received mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might manifest all longsuffering, as an example to those who are about to believe on Him unto eternal life.
Now to the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,
having faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,
of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
who desires all men to be saved and to come to a full true knowledge of the truth.
For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,
who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time,
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle; I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying; a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;
in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in appropriate apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing,
but, that which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works.
Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.
And I do not permit a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man, but to be in silence.
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
And Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled, fell into transgression.
Nevertheless she will be kept safe through childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
This is a faithful saying: If a man aspires to the position of an overseer, he desires a good work.
An overseer then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, well ordered, hospitable, able to teach;
not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for money, but fair-minded, not quarrelsome, not loving money;
one who rules his own house well, having his children in subjection with all respect
(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);
not a new convert, that he not be puffed up with pride and fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
Moreover he must have a good testimony with those who are outside, that he not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money,
holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless.
Likewise women must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;
but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up in glory.
Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, being devoted to corrupting spirits and doctrines of demons,
speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared,
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving;
for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.
If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness.
For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance.
For to this end we both labor and are reproached, because we trust in the living God, who is the preserver of all men, especially of those who believe.
These things command and teach.
Let no one despise your youth, but become an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.
Attend to these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all.
Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will deliver both yourself and those who hear you.
Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,
older women as mothers, younger ones as sisters, with all purity.
Honor widows who are truly widows.
But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God.
Now she who is truly a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.
But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
And these things command, that they may be blameless.
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, and not unless she has been the wife of one man,
being well reported of for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
But refuse the younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,
having condemnation because they have set aside their first faith.
And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
Therefore I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary for reproach.
For some have already turned aside after Satan.
If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are truly widows.
Let the elders who lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the Word and doctrine.
For the Scripture says, You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain, and, The laborer is worthy of his wages.
Do not receive an accusation against an elder except from two or three witnesses.
Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.
I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you keep watch over these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality.
Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure.
No longer drink only water, but use a little wine on account of your stomach and your frequent infirmities.
Some men’s sins are clearly evident, preceding them to judgment, but those of some men follow later.
Likewise, the good works of some are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.
Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed.
And those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brethren, but rather serve them because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.
If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
he is proud, understanding nothing, but is sick with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, slander, evil conjecture,
useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself.
But godliness with contentment is great gain.
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is evident that we can carry nothing out.
And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content.
But those who purpose to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which plunge people into ruin and destruction.
For the love of money is a root of all evils, for which some being greedy, have strayed from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
I charge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,
that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which He will reveal in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.
Command those who are rich in this present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.
Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share,
storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
O Timothy, guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and empty babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;
by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
to Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, how without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,
greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy,
when I call to remembrance the genuine faith that is in you, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded is in you also.
Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.
Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner, but partake in the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God,
who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has deprived death of its power and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel,
to which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep safe what I have committed to Him until that Day.
Hold fast the form of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
That good thing which was committed to you, guard it by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
but when he arrived in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.
The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that Day; and you know very well how many ways he ministered to me at Ephesus.
You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will also be able to teach others.
You therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
No one serving military duty entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him.
And also if anyone competes, he is not crowned unless he competes lawfully.
The hard-working farmer should rightfully be first to partake of the crops.
Consider what I say, and the Lord will give you understanding in all things.
Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel,
for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of bonds; but the Word of God is not bound.
Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
This is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him.
If we endure, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us.
If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.
Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to argue with empty words to no good, to the destruction of the hearers.
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.
But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will proceed to more ungodliness.
And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,
who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already come; and they overthrow the faith of some.
Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: The Lord knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor.
Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.
But flee youthful lusts; and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
But avoid foolish and unlearned questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
Besides, a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,
in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance unto a full true knowledge of the truth,
and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come:
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
without natural affection, unyielding, slanderers, without self-control, savage, despisers of good,
traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away.
For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,
always learning, but never able to come to the full true knowledge of the truth.
But as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith;
but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.
But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance,
persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
But evil men and pretenders will grow worse and worse, leading astray and being led astray.
But you continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them,
and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is breathed by God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:
Preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own lusts, desiring to hear pleasant things, they will heap up for themselves teachers;
and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to myths.
But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.
Hereafter, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all the ones loving His appearing.
Endeavor to come to me quickly;
for Demas has deserted me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica; Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.
Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry.
And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas when you come; and the books, especially the parchments.
Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil. The Lord render to him according to his works.
You also be on guard against him, for he has greatly opposed our words.
At my first defense no one stood with me, but all deserted me. May it not be reckoned against them.
But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that the preaching of the message might be fulfilled through me, and that all the Gentiles might hear. And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and keep me safe for His Heavenly kingdom. To Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
Erastus stayed in Corinth, but Trophimus I have left in Miletus sick.
Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as well as Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.
The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and full true knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
in hope of eternal life which God, who is without lie, promised before the beginning of time,
but has in due time proclaimed His Word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;
to Titus, a true son in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I assigned you:
If a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of loose behavior or disobedience.
For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not quarrelsome, not greedy for money,
but hospitable, a lover of what is good, of a sound mind, just, holy, self-controlled,
holding fast the faithful Word according to the teaching, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict.
For there are many insubordinate, idle talkers and seducers, especially those of the circumcision,
whose mouths must be stopped, who overturn whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.
One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.
This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
not giving heed to Jewish myths and commandments of men that turn away from the truth.
To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled.
They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and reprobate with regard to every good work.
But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine:
that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;
the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be blasphemed.
Likewise exhort the young men to be of sound mind,
in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,
sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he who is in opposition may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.
Let bondservants be obedient to their own masters, well pleasing in all things, not answering back,
not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live with sound mind, righteously, and godly in the present age,
looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify a people for His own possession, zealous unto good works.
Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey superiors, to be ready for every good work,
to speak evil of no one, not being a brawler, but fair, showing all meekness to all men.
For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, led astray, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.
But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,
not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
that being justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those believing in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.
But avoid foolish questionings, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the Law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Shun a man of heresy after the first and second admonition,
knowing that such a person is corrupt and sinning, being self-condemned.
When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with diligence, that they may lack nothing.
And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.
All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow laborer,
to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,
hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
that the fellowship of your faith may become active in the full true knowledge of every good thing in you in Christ Jesus.
For we have great joy and encouragement in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to order you to do what is fitting,
yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you; being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my bonds,
who once was worthless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.
I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,
whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my bonds of the gospel.
But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but willingly.
For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever,
no longer as a slave but more than a slave; a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me.
And if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account.
I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay; not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides.
Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.
Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
God, Who at various times and in various ways spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets,
has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, Whom He has appointed heir of all things, through Whom also He made the worlds;
Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His essence, and upholding all things by the Word of His power, when He had by Himself made purification for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.
For to which of the angels did He ever say: You are My Son, today I have begotten You? And again: I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son?
And again, when He brings the Firstborn into the world, He says: Let all the angels of God do homage to Him.
And of the angels He says: Who makes His angels spirits and His ministers a flame of fire.
But to the Son He says: Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness, beside Your companions.
And: You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands.
They will be destroyed, but You remain; and they will all grow old like a garment;
like a cloak You will fold them up, and they will be changed. But You are the same, and Your years will not fail.
But to which of the angels has He ever said: Sit at My right hand, till I place Your enemies as Your footstool?
Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who are about to inherit salvation.
Therefore we need to more abundantly heed the things we have heard, so that they do not slip our minds.
For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,
God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various works of power, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?
For He has not put the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels.
But one testified in a certain place, saying: What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You look upon him?
You have made him, for a little while, less than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, and set him over the works of Your hands.
You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put all things in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But at this time we do not yet see all things subjected under him.
But we see Jesus, who was made a little less than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.
For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Author of their salvation complete through sufferings.
For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,
saying: I will declare Your name to My brethren; in the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.
And again: I will put My trust in Him. And again: Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.
Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,
and set free those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
For indeed He does not take on the form of angels, but He does take on the seed of Abraham.
Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, in order to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
For in that He Himself has suffered, being tested, He is able to help those who are tested.
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the Heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,
who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house.
For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house.
For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.
And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken later,
but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you will hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
where your fathers tested Me, proved Me, and saw My works forty years.
Therefore I was angry with that generation, and said, They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways.
So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest.
Beware, brethren, that there not be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in withdrawing from the living God;
but exhort one another daily, while it is called Today, that not any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold fast to the origin of our Foundation steadfast to the end,
while it is said: Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.
For some who came out of Egypt through Moses, however not all, having heard, provoked.
Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear so that none of you should show evidence of falling short.
For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it.
For we who believe do enter into rest, as He has said: So I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;
and again in this place: They shall not enter My rest.
Since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the gospel was first preached did not enter in because of disobedience,
again He designates a certain day, saying in David, Today, after such a long time, as it has been said: Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.
For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.
There remains therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.
For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works as God did from His.
Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest, that no one fall according to the same example of disobedience.
For the Word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
And there is no creature that is not revealed in His presence, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must give answer.
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.
Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.
He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also encompassed by weakness.
Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.
So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: You are My Son, today I have begotten You.
As He also says in another place: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek;
who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who had the power to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear,
though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.
And having been found perfect, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,
called by God, High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek,
of whom we have much to say, and hard to explain with words, since you have become dull of hearing.
For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the rudimentary principles of the Words of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
For everyone who partakes only of milk is without experience in the Word of Righteousness, for he is an infant.
But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their understanding exercised to discern both good and evil.
Therefore, leaving the discussion of the rudiments concerning Christ, let us move along to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
of the doctrine of immersion, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
And this we will do if God permits.
For it is impossible for those who at one time were given understanding, and have tasted the Heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,
and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the age to come,
and also turn aside, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and expose Him to public disgrace.
For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God;
but if it bears thorns and briars, it is unfit and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned up.
But, beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, indeed, holding fast to salvation, though we speak in this manner.
For God is not unjust, to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end,
that you do not become slothful, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
For when God made a promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself,
saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
For men indeed swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is for them an end of all dispute.
Thus God, determining to show more abundantly to the heirs of promise the immutability of His counsel, pledged it by an oath,
that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.
This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters in within the veil,
where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, meaning king of peace,
without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.
Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.
And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the Law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;
but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
And without any contradiction the inferior is blessed by the better.
Here mortal men receive tithes, but there it is witnessed that he lives.
Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,
for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?
For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the Law.
For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has attended at the altar.
For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest
who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.
For He testifies: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
For there is indeed an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness.
For the Law made nothing perfect, but a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
And inasmuch as not without an oath
(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: The Lord has sworn and will not repent, You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek),
by so much Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant.
Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.
But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.
Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He lives forever to make intercession for them.
For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;
who does not need, as the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
For the Law appoints as high priests men who have infirmity, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever.
Now this is the main point of the things being said: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer.
For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the Law;
who serve the copy and shadow of the Heavenly things, as Moses was divinely admonished when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, See that you make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.
For if that first had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
Because finding fault with them, He says: Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant, and bring fulfillment to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah;
not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will give My Laws into their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.
And they shall not each one teach his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for every one shall know Me, from the least of them to their great ones.
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will by no means remember any longer.
In that He says, New, He has made the first old. Now what is becoming worn out and growing old is ready to disappear.
Then indeed, even the first covenant had ordinances of service and the earthly sanctuary.
For the first tabernacle was prepared: in which was the lampstand, the table, and the Bread of Presentation, which is called the sanctuary;
and behind the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
which had the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;
and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, performing the services.
But into the second the high priest went alone once a year, not without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins of the people, committed in ignorance;
the Holy Spirit signifying by this that the way into the Holy of Holies was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing.
It was a comparison for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience;
concerned only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time when things were set right.
But Christ came as High Priest of the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.
Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with His own blood He entered the Holy of Holies once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh,
how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
For where there is a covenant, it is a necessity to announce the death of the one making the covenant.
For a covenant is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the one who made the covenant is alive.
Therefore neither was the first covenant dedicated without blood.
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,
saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.
Then likewise he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of service.
And according to the Law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;
not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Holy of Holies every year with blood of others;
He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once for all, at the end of the ages, He has been manifested to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.
And as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this the judgment,
so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, without sin, unto salvation.
For the Law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of those things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.
For then, would they not have ceased to be offered? For those serving, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.
But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.
You did not take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.
Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me) to do Your will, O God.
Previously saying, Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and offerings for sin You did not desire, nor were pleased with them (which are offered according to the Law),
then He said, Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.
By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,
from that time onward waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.
For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My Laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,
then He adds, Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.
Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus,
by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil; that is, His flesh;
and having a High Priest over the house of God,
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
Let us hold fast the confession of the hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.
And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting; and so much the more as you see the Day drawing near.
For if we sin willfully after we have received the full true knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour those who oppose.
Anyone who rejected Moses’ Law dies without mercy before two or three witnesses.
Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled on the Son of God, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of Grace?
For we know Him who has said, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge His people.
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
But remember the former days in which, after you were given understanding, you endured a great struggle with afflictions,
indeed while you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions, and also while you became companions of those who were so treated;
for you had compassion on me in my bonds, and joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods, knowing, yourselves, that you have a better and an enduring possession in Heaven.
Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.
For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:
For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not linger.
Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, My soul is not pleased with him.
But we are not of those who draw back to destruction, but of those who believe to the preserving of the soul.
Now faith is the certainty of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
For by it the elders bore witness.
By faith we understand that the universe was prepared by the Word of God, so that the things which are seen did not come into existence from things which are visible.
By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks.
By faith Enoch was translated so that he did not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before he was translated he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not understanding where he was going.
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised.
Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born as many as the stars of the sky in multitude; innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and confessed that they were foreigners and pilgrims on the earth.
For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland.
And truly if they had called to mind that place from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return.
But now they reach forth to a better, that is, a heavenly place. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.
By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
of whom it was said, In Isaac your Seed shall be called,
reckoning that God had the power to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and did homage on the top of his staff.
By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a proper male child; and they were not afraid of the king’s decree.
By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin,
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he looked to the recompense.
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.
By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn should not touch them.
By faith they crossed over the Red Sea as through dry land, whereas the Egyptians, attempting to do so, were swallowed up.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for seven days.
By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish with those who did not believe, when she had received the spies with peace.
And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets:
who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreigners.
Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
Still others had trial of mockings and floggings, yes, and of bonds and imprisonment.
They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tried, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, oppressed;
of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.
And all these, having borne witness through faith, did not obtain the promise,
God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made complete apart from us.
Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so persistently harasses us, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,
looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
For consider Him who endured such opposition from sinners against Himself, that you not become weary and faint in your souls.
You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin.
And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked by Him.
For whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and whips every son whom He receives.
If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not discipline?
But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.
Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?
For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness.
Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.
Therefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,
and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed.
Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord;
watching carefully that no one fall short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and through this many become defiled;
that there be no prostitute or profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food gave away his birthright.
For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.
For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,
and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore.
(For they could not endure what was commanded: And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.
And so formidable was the sight that Moses said, I am in terror and trembling.)
But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable multitude of angels,
to the gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are registered in Heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made complete,
to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.
See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from the One speaking from Heaven,
whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.
Now this, Yet once more, indicates the removal of those things that are being overthrown, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be overthrown may remain.
Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
For our God is a consuming fire.
Let brotherly love continue.
Do not forget hospitality, for by so doing some have unknowingly entertained angels.
Remember the prisoners as if bound with them; and those who are mistreated, as also being in the body, yourselves.
Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled; but prostitutes and adulterers God will judge.
Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, By no means will I ever leave you nor ever forsake you.
So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?
Remember those in authority over you, who have spoken the Word of God to you. Observing the outworkings of their behavior, imitate their faith.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.
Do not be carried about with various and strange doctrines. For it is good that the heart be established by grace, not with foods which have not profited those who have been occupied with them.
We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.
For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.
Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate.
Therefore let us go forth to Him, outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one to come.
Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, confessing to His name.
But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
Obey those in authority over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you.
Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably.
But I especially urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you more quickly.
Now may the God of peace who brought up our Lord Jesus from the dead, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
make you complete in every good work to do His will, working in you what is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
And I appeal to you, brethren, endure the word of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words.
Know that our brother Timothy has been set free, with whom I shall see you if he comes shortly.
Greet all those in authority over you, and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.
Grace be with you all. Amen.
<b>[Epistle of JACOB]</b><RF>-the vw-edition name as properly derived from the Greek (Iakobos)<Rf> -- Jacob, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.
My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
But let patience have its perfecting work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
Let the lowly brother rejoice in his exaltation,
but the rich in his humiliation, because as the flower of the field he will pass away.
For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. Thus the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.
Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lusts and enticed.
Then, when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.
Do not be led astray, my beloved brethren.
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no change or shadow of turning.
Of His own purpose He brought us forth by the Word of Truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
for the wrath of man does not bring about the righteousness of God.
Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted Word, which has the power to save your souls.
But be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
For if anyone is a hearer of the Word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets of what sort he was.
But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in his deeds.
If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but beguiles his own heart, this one’s religion is vain.
Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.
For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes,
and you have regard for the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, You sit here in a good place, and say to the poor man, You stand there, or, Sit here at my footstool,
have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?
Listen, my beloved brethren: Has God not chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
But you have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to the judgment seats?
Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are called?
But if you fulfill the royal Law according to the Scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well;
but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the Law as transgressors.
For whoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.
For He who said, Do not commit adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the Law.
So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.
For judgment will be without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Indeed, mercy rejoices over judgment.
What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Is faith able to save him?
If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,
and one of you says to them, Depart in peace, be warmed and filled, but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?
Thus also faith, if it does not have works, being alone, is dead.
But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith from my works.
You believe that God is One. You do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder.
But are you willing to understand, O vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?
Was not Abraham our father justified from works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
Do you see how faith was working together with his works, and from works faith was made complete?
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. And he was called, Friend of God.
You see then that a man is justified from works, and not by faith only.
Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified from works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead also.
My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.
For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a flawless man, able also to bridle the whole body.
Behold, we put bits in horses’ mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body.
Behold also the ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the helmsman desires.
Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. Behold, how large a forest a little fire kindles.
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Thus the tongue is set among our members, defiling the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by Gehenna.
For every kind of beast and bird, and of creeping thing and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.
But no man is able to tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison.
With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the image of God.
Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, it is not fitting that these things be this way.
Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?
Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show his works out of good conduct, in the meekness of wisdom.
But if you have bitter envy and contention in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.
This wisdom does not come down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.
For where envy and contention exist, there is confusion and every evil deed.
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, fair, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
Moreover the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
Where do wars and fightings come from among you? Do they not come from your lusts that war in your members?
You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.
You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your lusts.
Adulterers and adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore purposes to be a friend of the world is shown to be opposing God.
Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, The Spirit who dwells in us yearns to envy?
But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
Lament and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to shame.
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will exalt you.
Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the Law and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.
There is one Lawgiver, who has the power to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?
Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we will go to this city, spend a year there, do business, and make a profit;
whereas you do not know what will be tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.
Instead you ought to say, If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.
But now you boast in your presumptions. All such boasting is evil.
Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your calamities that are coming upon you.
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have heaped up treasure in the last days.
Indeed the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.
You have lived on the earth in pleasure and luxury; you have fattened your hearts as in a day of slaughter.
You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.
Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain.
You also be patient. Make your hearts firm, for the coming of the Lord draws near.
Do not grumble against one another, brethren, that you not be condemned. Behold, the Judge stands at the door.
My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering affliction and endurance.
Indeed we count them blessed who endure. You have heard of the endurance of Job and seen the outcome brought about by the Lord; that the Lord is very kind and merciful.
But above all things, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your Yes, be Yes, and your No, No, so that you do not fall under condemnation.
Is anyone among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms.
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he may have committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man is mighty.
Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and he prayed to God that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth sprouted its fruit.
Brethren, if anyone among you goes astray from the truth, and someone turns him back,
let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and conceal a multitude of sins.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the sojourners of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials,
that the testing of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found unto praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him yet, believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
receiving the outcome of your faith; the salvation of your souls.
Of this salvation the prophets have sought out and searched diligently, who prophesied concerning the grace towards you,
searching for what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these things.
To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from Heaven; things which angels desire to look into.
Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts in your ignorance;
but as He who called you is holy, you also become holy in all conduct,
because it is written, Be holy, because I am holy.
And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, behave yourselves throughout the time of your sojourning in fear;
knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your vain way of life received by tradition from your fathers,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.
He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you
who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.
Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently out of a pure heart,
having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the Word of God which lives and abides forever,
because All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,
but the Word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the Word which by the gospel was preached to you.
Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking,
as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,
if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
Coming to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,
you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes on Him will by no means be ashamed.
Therefore, to you who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, The stone which the builders rejected has become the Head of the corner,
and a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offense. They stumble, being disobedient to the Word, to which they also were appointed.
But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people of His possession, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who did not have mercy but now have mercy.
Beloved, I beg you as foreigners and sojourners, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,
having your behavior honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man because of the Lord; whether to the king as supreme,
or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good.
For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men;
as free, yet not using liberty as a pretext for evil, but as bondservants of God.
Honor all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and fair, but also to the perverse.
For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering undeservedly.
For what praise is it if, when you are beaten for your faults, you endure it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you endure it patiently, this is favorable with God.
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:
Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth;
who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but gave Himself over to Him who judges righteously;
who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
Wives, likewise, be subject to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the Word, they, without a word, may be won by the behavior of their wives,
when they observe your pure behavior with fear.
Do not let your adornment be outward; arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on apparel;
rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a meek and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.
For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands,
as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.
Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be cut off.
Finally, all of you be of one mind, sympathetic; loving the brothers, be tenderhearted, be kind;
not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, in order that you may inherit blessing.
For He who would love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit.
Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
And who is he who will harm you if you become imitators of what is good?
But even if you should suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their terror, nor be troubled.
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;
having a good conscience, that when they speak against you as evildoers, those who falsely accuse your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.
For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit,
by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,
who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
There is also an antitype which now saves us; immersion (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
who has gone into Heaven and is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.
Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has been released from sin,
that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God.
For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.
In this regard, they think it strange that you do not run with them in the same overflow of dissipation, blaspheming.
They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be of sound mind and calm in your prayers.
And above all things have fervent love for one another, for love will cover a multitude of sins.
Be hospitable to one another without murmuring.
As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
If anyone speaks, let him speak as the words of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and might forever and ever. Amen.
Beloved, do not be astonished at the fiery trial which is to try you, as though something unheard of was happening to you;
but rejoice in so far as you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.
If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. According to them He is blasphemed, but according to you He is glorified.
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people’s matters.
Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this regard.
For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
Now if the righteous one is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.
The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed:
Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not eager for dishonest gain but with a ready mind;
not exercising dominion over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock;
and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.
Likewise you that are younger, be subject to your elders. Yes, all of you be subject to one another, and be clothed with humility, for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,
casting all your anxiety upon Him, because He cares about you.
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are experienced by your brethren in the world.
But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.
To Him be the glory and might forever and ever. Amen.
By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
Those in Babylon, elect together with you, greet you; and so does Mark my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Simon Peter, a bondservant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the full true knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the full true knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,
by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, supply with your faith virtue, with virtue knowledge,
with knowledge self-control, with self-control perseverance, with perseverance godliness,
with godliness brotherly affection, and with brotherly affection love.
For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the full true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his sins of the past.
Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make sure of your calling and election, for if you do these things you will not ever stumble;
for so an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied to you.
For this reason I will not be negligent to always remind you of these things, though you know and are established in the present truth.
Yes, I think it is right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up with reminders,
knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ made known to me.
Moreover I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my departure.
For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And we heard this voice which came from Heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
And so we also have a more sure Word of prophecy, which you do well to heed as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;
knowing this first, that not any of the prophecies of Scripture came into being from personal exposition,
for prophecy was not formerly brought forth by man’s choice, but holy men of God spoke as they were propelled along by the Holy Spirit.
But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.
And many will follow their destructive ways, through whom the way of truth will be blasphemed.
By covetousness they will exploit you with well-turned words; whose judgment of old is not idle, and their destruction does not slumber.
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;
and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing the flood on the world of the ungodly;
and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those intending to live ungodly;
and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the lustful behavior of the wicked
(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, his righteous soul was tormented from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds);
then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust for the day of judgment, to be punished,
and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of defilement and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries.
Whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,
and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who consider it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, delighting in their own deceptions while they feast with you,
having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; accursed children.
They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.
These are wells without water, clouds being driven by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through wantonness, the ones who have actually escaped from those living in error.
While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage.
For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the full true knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the end is worse for them than the beginning.
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to his own vomit, and, a sow, having been washed, to her wallowing in the mire.
Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder),
that you may remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior,
knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts,
and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were since the beginning of creation.
For of this they are willfully ignorant: that by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water,
by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water.
But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same Word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
But, beloved, do not be unaware of this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
The Lord is not slow concerning His promise, as some count slowness, but is longsuffering toward us, not purposing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with intense burning; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.
Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, of what sort ought you to be in holy behavior and godliness,
looking for and earnestly hastening unto the coming of the Day of God, through which the heavens will be dissolved, being set on fire, and the elements will melt with intense burning?
Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, spotless and without blemish;
and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you,
as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction.
You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware also that you not be led away with the error of the wicked, and fall from your own steadfastness.
But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen.
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of Life;
the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare to you that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.
And these things we write to you that your joy may be full.
This is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.
My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world.
Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.
He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
But whoever keeps His Word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.
He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
Brethren, I do not write a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the Word which you heard from the beginning.
Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now.
He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause stumbling.
But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you through His name.
I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome evil. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father.
I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome evil.
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
For all that is in the world; the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; is not of the Father but is of the world.
And the world is passing away, and its lust; but he who does the will of God abides forever.
Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have risen up, by which we know that it is the last hour.
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be made manifest, that not all of them are of us.
But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that not any lie is of the truth.
Who is a liar but he who denies, saying that Jesus is not the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.
Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father.
Therefore let abide in you that which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
And this is the promise that He has promised us: Eternal Life.
These things I have written to you concerning those who try to lead you astray.
But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will remain in Him.
And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be distanced from Him in shame at His coming.
If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who produces righteousness is born of Him.
Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God. Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.
Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.
And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
Whoever produces sin also produces lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
And you know that He was manifested in order to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.
Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him.
Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who produces righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
He who produces sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this, the Son of God was made known, that He might destroy the works of the devil.
Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and it is not his nature to sin, because he has been born of God.
In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not produce righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.
For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,
not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother’s righteous.
Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother remains in death.
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
By this we know the love of God, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
But whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?
My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
And by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.
For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.
Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.
And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight.
And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, as He gave us commandment.
Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.
By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.
You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error.
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God.
He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
In this the love of God was revealed in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him.
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us.
By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.
Love has been perfected with us in this: that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment. But he who fears has not been made complete in love.
We love Him because He first loved us.
If someone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how is he able to love God whom he has not seen?
And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God also loves his brother.
Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born from God, and everyone who loves Him who begets also loves him who is begotten from Him.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments.
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome.
For whatever is born from God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world; our faith.
Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
This is He who came through water and blood; Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.
For there are three that bear witness in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.
And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are into one.
If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which He has witnessed about His Son.
He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.
And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked from Him.
If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not unto death. There is sin unto death. I do not say that he should ask about that.
All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.
We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and the evil does not touch him.
We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.
And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
Little children, keep yourselves away from idols. Amen.
The Elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,
because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever.
Grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly because I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.
And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.
This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.
For many corrupters have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a corrupter and an antichrist.
Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we have produced, but that we may receive a full reward.
Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor speak a blessing to him;
for he who blesses him shares in his evil deeds.
Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
The Elder, to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers.
For I rejoiced greatly when brethren came and bore witness of the truth that is in you, just as you walk in truth.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth.
Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers,
who have borne witness of your love before the church. If you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well,
because they went forth on behalf of His name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth.
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us.
Therefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, ranting against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and prevents those who want to, putting them out of the church.
Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.
I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink;
but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face. Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
<b>[Epistle of JUDAS]</b><RF>-the vw-edition name as properly derived from the Greek (Ioudass)<Rf> -- Judas, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of Jacob, to those who are called, set apart by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ:
Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning the common salvation, it was necessary for me to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.
For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were set forth to this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny the only Lord God, even our Lord Jesus Christ.
But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the Great Day;
as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after other flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, despise rulership, and speak evil of dignitaries.
Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a blasphemous condemnation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.
But these speak evil of things they do not know; and whatever they understand naturally, like animals without reason, in these things they corrupt themselves.
Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have rushed out in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you, serving themselves without fear. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.
Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these men also, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with innumerable hosts of His saints,
to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
These are murmurers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and their mouths speak great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage.
But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:
how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts.
These are they who set themselves apart, sensual persons, not having the Spirit.
But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
And on some have compassion, making a distinction;
but others rescue with fear, snatching them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.
Now to Him who has the power to keep you from stumbling, and to present you without blemish before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,
to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to His servants; things which must happen quickly. And He sent and signified it by His angel to His servant John,
who bears witness to the Word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.
Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near.
John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,
and from Jesus Christ, the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn out from the dead, and the Ruler over the kings of the earth; to Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
and has made us kings and priests to God, even His Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, says the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
I, John, both your brother and companion in the affliction and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos because of the Word of God and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.
I came to be in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,
saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last; and, What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.
Then I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
and in the midst of the seven lampstands One like the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girded about the chest with a golden band.
Moreover His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes like a flame of fire;
His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;
He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth went a sharp two-edged sword, and His appearance was like the sun shining in its strength.
And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand on me, saying to me, Do not be terrified; I am the First and the Last.
I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death.
Write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things.
The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.
To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, These things says He who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:
I know your works, your labor, your patience, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not, and have found them to be liars;
and you have persevered and have patience, and have labored on account of My name and have not become weary.
Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.
Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works; and if not, I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place; unless you repent.
But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.
And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and lives:
I know your works, affliction, and poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt by the second death.
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:
I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith even in the days in which Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality.
Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
Repent. But if not, I will come to you quickly and will make war with them with the sword of My mouth.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except him who receives it.
And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:
I know your works, and love, and service, and faith, and patience and your works; and the last being more than the first.
Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and lead astray My servants to prostitute themselves to sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols.
And I gave her time to repent of her sexual perversion, and she did not repent.
Indeed I will cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent of their deeds.
And I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the inner thoughts and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.
Now to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.
But hold fast what you have till I come.
And he who overcomes, and keeps My works unto the end, to him I will give authority over the nations;
He shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be dashed to pieces like the potter’s vessels; as I also have received from My Father;
and I will give him the Morning Star.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you live, but you are dead.
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works being fulfilled before God.
Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not at all know what hour I will come upon you.
You have a few names even in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.
He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, These things says He who is holy, He who is true, He who has the key of David, He who opens and no one shuts, and shuts and no one opens:
I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My Word, and have not denied My name.
Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but lie; indeed I will make them come and bow the knee before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.
Because you have kept the Word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
Behold, I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.
He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall never go out any more. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of Heaven from My God; and My new name.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:
I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I would that you were cold or hot.
So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.
Because you say, I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing; and do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked;
I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.
To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
After these things I looked, and behold, a door having been opened in Heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after these things.
Immediately I came to be in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and One sat on the throne.
And He who sat was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads.
And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. And seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
Before the throne there was a glassy sea, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.
The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
The four living creatures, each had six wings around, and were full of eyes within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and do homage to Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and through Your will they exist and were created.
And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.
Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loosen its seals?
And no one in Heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look upon it.
So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look upon it.
But one of the elders said to me, Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loosen its seven seals.
And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God having been sent out into all the earth.
And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
And they sing a new song, saying: You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
and have made us kings and priests to our God; and we shall reign upon the earth.
Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,
saying with a loud voice: Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!
And every creature which is in Heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: Blessing and honor and glory and power be to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!
And the four living creatures said, Amen! And the twenty-four elders fell down and did homage to Him who lives forever and ever.
Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, Come and see.
And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, indeed in order to conquer.
When He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come and see.
And another horse, fiery red, went out. And it was granted to the one who sat on it to take peace from the earth, and that people should kill one another; and there was given to him a great sword.
And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, Come and see. So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.
And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come and see.
So I looked, and behold, a pale green horse. And the name of him who sat on it was Death, and Hades followed behind him. And authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, with hunger, with death, and by the beasts of the earth.
And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the Word of God and because of the testimony which they held.
And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?
And a white robe was given to each one of them; and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they were, was filled up.
And I looked when He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood.
And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its untimely figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind.
And the heavens separated as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,
and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?
After these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,
saying, Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees till we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.
And I heard the number of those who were sealed: One hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel were sealed.
Of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand were sealed;
of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand were sealed;
of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand were sealed;
of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.
After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one was able to number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,
and crying out with a loud voice, saying, Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!
And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne and did homage to God,
saying: Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom, thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.
Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, Who are these arrayed in white robes, and where did they come from?
And I said to him, Sir, you know. So he said to me, These are the ones coming out of great affliction, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them.
They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; the sun shall not fall on them, nor any burning heat;
for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to living fountains of waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.
And another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand.
And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it to the earth. And there were noises, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.
So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
And the first angel sounded: And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. And a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
Then the second angel sounded: And something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.
And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Then the third angel sounded: And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
And the name of the star is called Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.
Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.
And I saw, and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!
Then the fifth angel sounded: And I saw a star falling from heaven towards the earth. To him was given the key to the bottomless pit.
And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. And the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit.
And out of the smoke locusts came forth upon the earth. And to them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
And they were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but to torment them for five months. And their torment is like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will crave to die, and death will flee from them.
And the shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. And on their heads something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
And they had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.
And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle.
They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their authority was to hurt men five months.
And they had as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
One woe is past. Behold, two more woes come after these things.
Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,
saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.
So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.
Now the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred million; and I heard the number of them.
And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates being fiery like hyacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone.
By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths.
For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.
But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not do homage to demons, and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which are not able to see nor hear nor walk.
And they did not repent of their murders nor their sorceries nor their sexual perversions nor their thefts.
And I saw another mighty angel coming down from Heaven, clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was on his head, his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.
And he had a little book open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roars. When he cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.
Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.
And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to Heaven
and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no more time;
but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.
And the voice which I heard from Heaven spoke to me again and said, Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.
So I went to the angel and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.
And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.
And I was given a reed like a staff. And the angel stood, saying, Arise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who do homage there.
But leave out the court which is outside the temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.
And I will give to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.
And if anyone tries to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone tries to harm them, he must be killed in this manner.
These have authority to shut the heavens, so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over waters to turn them to blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.
And when they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war against them, overcome them, and kill them.
And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
And those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three and a half days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves.
And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
And after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great terror fell on those who saw them.
And they heard a loud voice out of Heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended towards Heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.
And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.
The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.
Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in Heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world have been made those of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!
And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and did homage to God,
saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was and who is to come, because You have taken Your great power and reigned.
And the nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.
Then the temple of God in Heaven was opened, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, voices, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.
Now a great sign appeared in the heavens: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars.
And being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth.
And another sign appeared in the heavens: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads.
And his tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, in order to devour her Child as soon as it was born.
And she bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught away to God and His throne.
Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.
And war broke out in Heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,
but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in Heaven any longer.
So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who leads the whole world astray; he was cast out onto the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
And I heard a loud voice saying in Heaven, Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.
And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and through the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives unto death.
Therefore rejoice, O Heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time left.
And when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child.
But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.
And the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood.
But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads names of blasphemy.
And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
And I saw one of his heads as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And all the world marveled at the beast.
So they did homage to the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they did homage to the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?
And he was given a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for forty-two months.
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, His tabernacle, and those who dwell in Heaven.
And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.
And all who dwell on the earth will do homage to him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon.
And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to do homage to the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
And he performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven onto the earth in the sight of men.
And he leads astray those who dwell on the earth by means of those signs which he was granted to do in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword and lived.
And it was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not do homage to the image of the beast to be killed.
And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads,
so that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
Then I looked, and behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His Father’s name written on their foreheads.
And I heard a sound from Heaven, like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of harpists playing their harps.
And they sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.
These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He leads. These were redeemed from among men, being firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without blemish before the throne of God.
And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth; to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people;
saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; also, do homage to Him who made the heavens and the earth, the sea and springs of water.
And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual perversion.
And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone does homage to the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand,
he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His anger. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.
And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who do homage to the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
Here is the perseverance of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
And I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow with them.
And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat One like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.
And another angel came forth out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.
And another angel came forth out of the temple which is in Heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came forth out from the altar, who had authority over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.
So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came forth out of the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles, by a distance of one thousand six hundred furlongs.
And I saw another sign in Heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is finished.
And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having harps of God.
And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints.
Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and do homage before You, for Your righteous deeds have been manifested.
After these things I looked, and behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in Heaven was opened.
And out of the temple came forth the seven angels having the seven plagues, clothed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden bands.
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels would be completed.
And I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the bowls of the wrath of God onto the earth.
So the first went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a bad and evil sore came upon the men who had the mark of the beast and those who did homage to his image.
And the second angel poured out his bowl onto the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living soul in the sea died.
And the third angel poured out his bowl onto the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
And I heard the angel of the waters saying: You are righteous, O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be, because You have judged these things,
for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink, for they are deserving.
And I heard another out of the altar saying, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.
And the fourth angel poured out his bowl onto the sun, and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.
And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has authority over these plagues; and they did not repent to give Him glory.
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl onto the throne of the beast, and his kingdom became full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain.
And they blasphemed the God of Heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their deeds.
And the sixth angel poured out his bowl onto the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go forth to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, that he not walk naked and they see his shame.
And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of Heaven, from the throne, saying, It is finished!
And there were noises and thunderings and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth.
And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the anger of His wrath.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
And great hail from heaven fell upon men, each hailstone about the weight of a talent. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because the plague is exceedingly great.
And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
with whom the kings of the earth prostituted themselves, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her sexual perversities.
So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her sexual perversities.
And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.
And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.
There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he comes, he must continue a short time.
And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction.
The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority for one hour as kings with the beast.
These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.
These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, elect, and faithful.
Then he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues.
And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and consume her with fire.
For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth.
After these things I saw another angel coming down from Heaven, having great power, and the earth was illuminated with his glory.
And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird!
For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual perversities, the kings of the earth have prostituted themselves with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the power of her luxury.
And I heard another voice from Heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, so that you not share in her sins, and so that you not receive of her plagues.
For her sins have reached to Heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her.
By however much she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, by the same amount give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, I sit as queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.
Therefore her plagues will come in one day; death and mourning and famine. And she will be consumed with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her.
The kings of the earth who prostituted themselves and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her, when they see the smoke of her burning,
standing at a distance because of the terror of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:
merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of thyine wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;
and cinnamon and incense, ointment and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, beasts and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.
And the fruit that your soul lusted for has gone from you, and all the things which are rich and splendid have gone from you, and you shall find them no more at all.
The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand at a distance because of the terror of her torment, weeping and wailing,
and saying, Alas, alas, that great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!
For in one hour such great riches is come to nothing. Every shipmaster, all who travel by ship, sailors, and as many as trade on the sea, stood at a distance
and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like this great city?
And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! For in one hour she is made desolate.
Rejoice over her, O Heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!
Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall by no means be found anymore.
The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall by no means be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall ever be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall by no means be heard in you anymore.
And the light of a lamp shall not ever shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not ever be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were led astray.
And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.
And after these things I heard a loud voice of a great multitude in Heaven, saying, Alleluia! Salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God!
For true and righteous are His judgments, because He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her sexual perversities; and He has avenged on her the blood of His servants shed by her.
And again they said, Alleluia! Her smoke rises up forever and ever!
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God sitting on the throne, saying, Amen! Alleluia!
Then a voice came from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you His servants and those who fear Him, both small and great.
And I heard, as it were, the sound of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!
Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.
And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, pure and bright, for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
And he said to me, Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true sayings of God.
And I fell at his feet to do homage to him. But he said to me, Look out! No! I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Do homage to God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
And I saw Heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.
His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.
And He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
And the armies in Heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and pure, followed Him on white horses.
And out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He might strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of the heavens, Come and gather together for the supper of the great God,
that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great.
And I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.
And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who worked signs in his presence, by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who did homage to his image. These two were cast alive into the Lake of Fire burning with brimstone.
And the rest were killed with the sword which proceeded out of the mouth of Him who sat on the horse. And all the birds were filled with their flesh.
And I saw an angel coming down from Heaven, having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
And he laid hold of the dragon, that serpent of old, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal on him, so that he should not lead astray the nations any more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.
And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the Word of God, who had not done homage to the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be set loose out of his prison
and will go out to lead astray the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea.
And they went up over the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.
And the devil, who led them astray, was cast into the Lake of Fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
And I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away. And there was found no place for them.
And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God. And books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, out of the things which were written in the books.
And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one, according to their works.
And Death and Hades were cast into the Lake of Fire. This is the second death.
And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.
And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of Heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
And I heard a loud voice from Heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.
And He who sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He says to me, Write, for these Words are true and faithful.
And He said to me, It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending. I will give of the fountain of the Water of Life freely to him who thirsts.
He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.
But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, prostitutes, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of Heaven from God,
having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
And having a great and high wall with twelve gates, and twelve angels at the gates, and names written on them, which are of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:
three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
Now the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
And he who talked with me had a gold reed to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
And the city is laid out as a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.
And he measured its wall: one hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
And the construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like pure glass.
And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kinds of precious stones: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: each individual gate was of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
And the city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it; and the Lamb is its light.
And the nations of those who are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it.
And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, because there shall be no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
But there shall by no means enter it anything that defiles, or produces an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life.
And he showed me a pure river of Water of Life, clear as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the Tree of Life, which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.
And they shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.
And there shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.
And he said to me, These Words are faithful and true. And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must quickly come to pass.
Behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the Words of the Prophecy of this Book.
Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
And he said to me, Now see here! No! For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the Words of this Book. Do homage to God.
And he said to me, Do not seal the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, for the time is at hand.
He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still.
And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to what his work shall be.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, the First and the Last.
Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the Tree of Life, and may enter through the gates into the city.
But outside are dogs and sorcerers and prostitutes and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and produces a lie.
I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you, to the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him who hears say, Come. And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take of the Water of Life freely.
For I testify to everyone who hears the Words of the Prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add upon him the plagues that are written in this Book;
and if anyone takes away from the Words of the Book of this Prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this Book.
He who testifies to these things says, Surely I am coming quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
